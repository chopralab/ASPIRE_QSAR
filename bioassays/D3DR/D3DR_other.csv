0,45420,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]-spiperone from CHO-K1 cell membranes expressing human dopamine 3 receptors,"Title: Evaluation of the effects of the enantiomers of reduced haloperidol, azaperol, and related 4-amino-1-arylbutanols on dopamine and sigma receptors._||_Abstract: The enantiomers of reduced haloperidol (3a), azaperol (3b), and the related compound BMY-14802 (3c) were prepared in high optical purity. The affinity of these compounds for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and sigma S1 and S2 sites was determined in vitro. Both enantiomers of 3a display greatly decreased affinity for D2 and D3 receptors compared to haloperidol, although they still possess affinities in the 100-200-nM range. Both enantiomers of 3a possess potent and equal affinity for S1 sites (Ki: 1-2 nM), only slightly weaker than haloperidol (Ki: 0.33 nM). At S2 sites, (R)-(+)-3a displays similar affinity to haloperidol (Ki: 31 and 26 nM, respectively), while (S)-(-)-3a is slight more potent (Ki: 8.2 nM). The stereoselectivity profile of the enantiomers of 3b at D2 and D3 receptors is quite similar to that of 3a, (S)-(-)-3b being about 4 times more potent than its enantiomer at both receptors. (R)-(+)-3b binds preferentially to sigma S1 over S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3b displays the opposite selectivity profile. Both enantiomers of 3c possess very weak affinity for D2 and D3 receptors. In a manner similar to the enantiomers of 3b, the affinity of (R)-(+)-3c is greater for S1 than S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3c displays the opposite selectivity profile. Following parenteral administration of both enantiomers of 3a, dopamine synthesis and turnover in rat striatum, cortex, and mesolimbic areas were increased, in a manner similar to the effects produced by haloperidol itself. Additional studies will be required to assess with certainty whether the effects were due to the compounds themselves or simply were a consequence of the in vivo oxidation to haloperidol.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL651365,20181014,3559|15443|6604868|10020651|16048564|24867245|44350942|44350991,103167216|103359590|103359652|103359654|103359671|103359710|103359798|103359799,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7902870,0,,P35462,9606.0,198.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

We also determined pKa values for apomorphine, chlorpromazine, and lidocaine, for reference purposes (7.6, 9.2, and 7.9, respectively).

Previous synthetic studies provided structural requirements for high affinity binding to D(3) receptors which included a 2,3-dichloro-phenylpiperazine linked to an arylamido function via a butyl chain. To reduce lipophilicity of these agents and further investigate optimal conformation, a second series of 15 novel ligands was designed that included heteroaromatic substitution and unsaturated alkyl linkers.

In these studies, a discrepancy between in vitro binding affinity, in vivo occupancy, and behavioral potency has been observed. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) modifications of the 2-pyridylphenyl moiety of 6 and (2) hydroxyl, acetyl, and cyclopropyl substitutions on the butylamide linking chain systematically coupled with 2-fluorenylamide or 2-pyridylphenylamide and 2-methoxy- or 2,3-dichloro-substituted phenylpiperazines to measure the impact on binding affinity, D2/D3 selectivity, lipophilicity, and function.

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.).

A review of previous reports indicates that arylalkyl substituents can improve the potency and selectivity of the binding affinity at D(2)-like receptors. In this paper, we explored the contributions of two key pharmacophoric groups, that is, 4'-fluorobutyrophenones and 3-methyl-7-azaindoles, to the potency and selectivity of synthesized agents at D(2)-like receptors. Preliminary observation of binding affinities indicates that there is little predictability of specific effects of the arylalkyl moieties but the composite structure is responsible for selectivity and potency at these receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1033196,20180910,3559|9906978|13091268|22065962|25129807|44123782|44395709|44395711|44591042|44591043|44591044|44591045|44591086|44591087|44591088|44591089,103167216|103391819|103488767|103650934|103650989|103650990|103650991|103650992|103651052|103651053|103651054|103651055|103651056|103651057|103651058|194151539,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19155177,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

This extension of structure-activity relationships (SAR) has resulted in the identification of the first enantioselective D3 antagonists (R- and S-22) to be reported, wherein enantioselectivity is more pronounced at D3 than at D2, and that a binding region on the second extracellular loop (E2) may play a role in both enantioselectivity and D3 receptor selectivity. Moreover, we have discovered some of the most D3-selective compounds reported to date that show high affinity (K(i) = 1 nM) for D3 and approximately 400-fold selectivity over the D2 receptor subtype. Several of these analogues showed exquisite selectivity for D3 receptors over >60 other receptors, further underscoring their value as in vivo research tools. These lead compounds also have appropriate physical characteristics for in vivo exploration and therefore will be useful in determining how intrinsic activity at D3 receptors tested in vitro is related to behaviors in animal models of addiction and other neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL961820,20180910,9888555|9980998|10092819|10276451|10438027|11351639|11408148|25141534|25141535|25141536|25141538|42625205|42625207|42625211|42625290|42625293|42625295|42626103|42626171|42626172|42626240|42626243|42626313|42626315|42626318|42626380|42626381|44393403,103252954|103356181|103381942|103382409|103440227|103440349|103449589|103449615|124955852|124958486|124958487|124959283|124961101|124961102|124961103|124961911|124961912|124963712|124964490|124964491|124966353|124966354|124969027|124969877|124969878|124971684|124972471|124974249,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19331412,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

It is a highly optimized noncovalent competitive inhibitor of full-length NS3-NS4A proteases of HCV genotypes 1a and 1b with K(i) values of 2.6 and 2.0 nM, respectively. K(i) values of 2 to 230 nM were measured against the NS3-NS4A proteases of HCV genotypes 2 to 6, whereas it was a very weak inhibitor of cathepsin B and showed no measurable inhibition of human leukocyte elastase. BI 201335 was also shown to be a potent inhibitor of HCV RNA replication in vitro with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) of 6.5 and 3.1 nM obtained in genotype 1a and 1b replicon assays. Combinations of BI 201335 with either interferon or ribavirin had additive effects in replicon assays. BI 201335 had good permeability in Caco-2 cell assays and high metabolic stability after incubation with human, rat, monkey, and dog liver microsomes. Its good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile in vitro, as well as in rat, monkey, and dog, predicted good pharmacokinetics (PK) in humans. Furthermore, drug levels were significantly higher in rat liver than in plasma, suggesting that distribution to the target organ may be especially favorable.

268,624500,Confirmatory,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: SAR in D3 Beta Arrestin Assay,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties._||_This is an selectivity assay to test the lead compounds against the D3 receptor, using a beta arrestin assay._||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network [MLPCN]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_Grant: NS0676421_||_PI Name: David Sibley, National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2702,20120817,133633|16007814|57377246|57383397|57383401|57383403|57383405|57383408|57383414|57383420|57383430|57383431|57383434|57383436,124880521|136882616|136889447|136889448|136889449|136889450|136889451|136889452|136889453|136889454|136889455|136889456|136889458|136889491,1814,,P35462,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1
269,624502,Other,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: SAR in D3 Binding Assay,"Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D3 cell line. This selectivity assay measures activity of the leads in the D3 radioligand binding assay._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS0676421_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2704,20120817,57377246,136882616,1814,,P35462,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

These ligands were labeled with the short-lived positron emitter fluorine-18 and analyzed for their potential application for imaging studies by positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro autoradiography was used to determine their nonspecific binding behavior as a result of their structural and thus physicochemical properties. The biodistribution, in vivo stability, and brain uptake of the most promising D4 radioligand candidate were determined. This proved to be 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-4-((6-fluoropyridin-3-yl)methyl)piperazine ([18F]3d), which revealed an excellent binding pattern with a high selectivity and limited nonspecific binding in vitro. This analogue also exhibited a high stability and an extremely high brain uptake in vivo with specific binding in hippocampus, cortex, colliculus, and cerebellum as determined by ex vivo autoradiography.

Specific examples include diseases of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems. The most significant pathway for cellular response to hypoxia is the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIFs are transcription factors responsible for the activation of genes which encode proteins that mediate adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. A high-throughput cell-based HIF-mediated gene reporter screen was carried out using the NIH's Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository to identify activators of the HIF pathway. This communication describes the subsequent medicinal chemistry optimization of a triazine scaffold that led to the identification of the new molecular probe ML228. A discussion of HIF activation SAR within this chemotype as well as detailed in vitro characterization of the probe molecule is presented here.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2156234,20180923,46742353,163336959,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22172704,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The arylsulfanyl pyrazolone (ASP) scaffold was one of the active scaffolds identified in a cell-based high throughput screening assay targeting mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) induced toxicity and aggregation as a marker for ALS. The initial ASP hit compounds were potent and had favorable ADME properties but had poor microsomal and plasma stability. Here, we identify the microsomal metabolite and describe synthesized analogues of these ASP compounds to address the rapid metabolism. Both in vitro potency and pharmacological properties of the ASP scaffold have been dramatically improved via chemical modification to the corresponding sulfone and ether derivatives. One of the ether analogues (13), with superior potency and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties, was tested in vivo for its pharmacokinetic profile, brain penetration, and efficacy in an ALS mouse model. The analogue showed sustained blood and brain levels in vivo and significant activity in the mouse model of ALS, thus validating the new aryloxanyl pyrazolone scaffold as an important novel therapeutic lead for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167234,20180923,45102767,136923905,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22191331,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167999,20180923,1346|851833|9859120|10354670|10454026|10456166|12461787|15356306|19871273|44203057|53248299|53248300|58358826,103169108|103196922|103356575|103402070|163313965|163324236|163327704|163327705|163327706|163329505|163334553|163334704|163334705,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Current therapeutic treatment for obesity is mostly focused on preventive measures involving dietary control and physical exercises in combination with anti-obesity medications. However, most of these anti-obesity medications have little or no effect on weight loss, and some cases have demonstrated fatal side effects. Due to the urgent need for highly potent and selective anti-obesity agents, the serotonin receptors (5-HTR) have been the focus of much interest as a novel therapeutic target. In this report, we have developed pyrimidoazepine analogs targeting the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and evaluated their biological activity in vitro and in vivo as novel anti-obesity agents. We were able to identify 6p as the most potent 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C ligand in vitro (IC50 = 3 nM and 2.3 nM, respectively), and this compound also demonstrated the greatest potency in vivo. In an acute obesity model, mice treated with 6p showed significant decrease in body weight gain and food intake over approximately 77-94% compared to a control group.

This implies a considerable diversity in the mechanisms of action produced by structural changes to the phenothiazine scaffold. For example, chlorpromazine treatment of psychosis is related to its interaction with dopaminergic receptors. On the other hand, antagonistic action of such drugs on cholinergic receptor systems would be counter-productive for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In a search for phenothiazines that are inhibitors of cholinesterases, especially butyrylcholinesterase, with potential to treat Alzheimer's disease, we wished to ascertain that such molecules could be devoid of neurotransmitter receptor interactions. To that end, a number of our synthetic N-10-carbonyl phenothiazine derivatives, with cholinesterase inhibitory activity, were tested for interaction with a variety of neurotransmitter receptor systems.

Given the absence of therapeutic options available and the significance of VEEV as a weaponized agent, an optimization effort was initiated around a quinazolinone screening hit 1 with promising cellular antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.8 μM), limited cytotoxic liability (CC50 > 50 μM), and modest in vitro efficacy in reducing viral progeny (63-fold at 5 μM). Scaffold optimization revealed a novel rearrangement affording amidines, specifically compound 45, which was found to potently inhibit several VEEV strains in the low nanomolar range without cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.02-0.04 μM, CC50 > 50 μM) while limiting in vitro viral replication (EC90 = 0.17 μM).

This study tested the hypothesis that further modifications of the tropane analog to produce compounds with less potent binding to the D2 receptor than haloperidol, would produce less catalepsy. These tests have now revealed that while haloperidol produced maximum catalepsy, these compounds produced moderate to low levels of catalepsy. Compound 9, with the least binding affinity to the D2R, produced the least catalepsy and highest Minimum Adverse Effective Dose (MAED) of the analogs tested regardless of their affinities at other receptors including the 5-HT1AR.

However, the majority of the nNOS inhibitors developed are arginine mimetics and, therefore, suffer from poor bioavailability. We designed a novel strategy to combine a more pharmacokinetically favorable 2-imidazolylpyrimidine head with promising structural components from previous inhibitors. In conjunction with extensive structure-activity studies, several highly potent and selective inhibitors of nNOS were discovered. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that these type II inhibitors utilize the same hydrophobic pocket to gain strong inhibitory potency (13), as well as high isoform selectivity. Interestingly, select compounds from this series (9) showed good permeability and low efflux in a Caco-2 assay, suggesting potential oral bioavailability, and exhibited minimal off-target binding to 50 central nervous system receptors. Furthermore, even with heme-coordinating groups in the molecule, modifying other pharmacophoric fragments minimized undesirable inhibition of cytochrome P450s from human liver microsomes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3412940,20181006,118730369,312384124,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25489882,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Diverse pharmacophore moieties yielded 3 series of hybrids with varying in vitro properties at 5-HT6R and D2R, and at M1 receptor and hERG channel antitargets. 4-(piperazin-1-yl)-1H-indole derivatives showed highest antagonist potency at 5-HT6R, with 7-butoxy-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one and 2-propoxybenzamide derivatives having promising D2R partial agonism. 2-(3-(4-(1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indol-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propoxy)benzamide (47) exhibited nanomolar affinity at both 5-HT6R and D2R and was evaluated in rat models. It displayed potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like activity in the Porsolt and Vogel tests, respectively, more pronounced than that of a reference selective 5-HT6R antagonist or D2R partial agonist. In addition, 47 also showed antidepressant-like activity (Porsolt's test) and anxiolytic-like activity (open field test) in aged (>18-month old) rats. In operant conditioning tests, 47 enhanced responding for sweet reward in the saccharin self-administration test, consistent with anti-anhedonic properties. Further, 47 facilitated extinction of non-reinforced responding for sweet reward, suggesting potential procognitive activity.

Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented. (S)-(+)-10r is the first highly potent and selective chiral inhibitor of FAAH-COX with marked in vivo activity, and represents a promising lead to discover novel analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3779475,20180905,117072556,336877911,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26774927,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041186,20200621,121250406,381873503,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations. These receptor models bound with partial agonists may be useful for structure-based design of compounds with tailored efficacy profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4052940,20200622,42626240|42626318|137639330|137647150|137656298|137657276,124961101|124969027|381848416|381859990|381873560|381879252,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27983845,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,1,1,1,1,1,0

This ligand comprises a thieno[2,3- d]pyrimidine scaffold that does not feature in known dopaminergic ligands. Herein, we provide pharmacological validation of an allosteric mode of action for 1, revealing that it is a NAM of dopamine efficacy and identify the structural determinants of this allostery. We find that key structural moieties are important for functional affinity and negative cooperativity, while functionalization of the thienopyrimidine at the 5- and 6-positions results in analogues with divergent cooperativity profiles. Successive compound iterations have yielded analogues exhibiting a 10-fold improvement in functional affinity, as well as enhanced negative cooperativity with dopamine affinity and efficacy.

If dark molecules are found active at a therapeutic target, their extraordinary selectivity profiles make excellent starting points for drug development. We explored if ligands of therapeutically relevant G-protein-coupled receptors could be discovered by structure-based virtual screening of the dark chemical matter. Molecular docking screens against crystal structures of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine and the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptors were carried out, and 53 top-ranked molecules were evaluated experimentally. Two ligands of each receptor were discovered, and the most potent had sub-micromolar affinities. Analysis of bioactivity data showed that the ligands lacked activity at hundreds of off-targets, including several that are associated with adverse effects.

Novel D4R-selective ligands have promise in medication development for neuropsychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and substance use disorders. To identify new D4R-selective ligands, and to understand the molecular determinants of agonist efficacy at D4R, we report a series of eighteen novel ligands based on the classical D4R agonist A-412997 (1, 2-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)- N-( m-tolyl)acetamide).

We identified several novel D4R-selective ( Ki ≤ 4.3 nM and >100-fold vs other D2-like receptors) compounds with diverse partial agonist and antagonist profiles, falling into three structural groups.

Unlike the dual D<sub>2</sub>R/D<sub>3</sub>R partial agonist cariprazine, compound 38 showed selective agonist activity for D<sub>2</sub>R over D<sub>3</sub>R. In fact, compound 38 exhibited potent antagonism of dopamine-stimulated β-arrestin2 recruitment.

Compound (1R,2R)-22e and its enantiomer (1S,2S)-22e show a comparable binding affinity for the D3R, but the former is a potent D3R agonist, while the latter acts as an antagonist. Molecular docking studies revealed different binding poses of the PCPMA moiety within the orthosteric binding pocket of the D3R, which might explain the different functional profiles of the enantiomers. Compound (1R,2R)-30q shows a high binding affinity for the D3R (Ki = 2.2 nM) along with good selectivity, as well as good bioavailability and brain penetration properties in mice. These results reveal that the PCPMA scaffold may serve as a privileged scaffold for the design of aminergic GPCR ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4406073,20210302,5202|155569198,103165719|440229054,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32282200,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The study allowed for the identification of 25 (4-{[5-methoxy-3-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-1H-indol-1-yl]sulfonyl}isoquinoline), a potent and selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. The selected compound, was evaluated in vivo in a novel object recognition (NOR) and forced swim (FST) tests in rats, demonstrating distinct pro-cognitive and antidepressant-like properties (MED = 1 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg, i.p., respectively). Compound SB-742457, used as comparator, reversed memory deficits in NOR task in similar doses, while in FST it was active in 10-30-fold higher dose (3 mg/kg). In contrast to SB-742457, which was active in Vogel test (MED = 3 mg/kg), compound 25 displayed no anxiolytic activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4426400,20210302,146680920|155519559,440123395|440145059,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27326337,0,,P35462,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429160,20210302,130431277|130431287|130431316|130431317|130431318|130431325|130431337|130431342|130431351|155514430|155533824|155535272|155552695,440111590|440115654|440116525|440126918|440135799|440145346|440147564|440152147|440152800|440157086|440162869|440187374|440188171,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,,P35462,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,1,1,1

Certain of the 2-aminoindan derivatives displayed pharmacologic properties consistent with their being dopaminergic agonists. The beta-phenethylamine derivative did not show any significant dopamine-like activity. The 7-hydroxy-8-methyloctahydrobenzo[f]quinoline derivative 4a was a moderately potent, short-acting DA2 receptor antagonist. All of the carboxylic acid derivatives were inert. Of the ortho hydroxy/methyl derivatives, only the 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-aminotetralin derivative displayed pharmacological properties consistent with its being a dopaminergic prodrug. It is concluded that 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (1a) is structurally unique for a dopaminergic drug.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL661208,20200628,6005|145954|10083326|44303823|44303825|44303826|44303827|44303828|44303830|44303832|44303845|44303865|44303869|44303870|44303872|44304062,103167211|103252888|103252908|103252910|103252911|103252912|103252913|103252915|103252916|103252937|103252957|103252961|103252962|103252963|103252965|103253393,1812|1813|1814|1815|1816,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3761320,0,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,9685.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

More recently, it has been speculated that the metabolic transformation to MPP+-like species may contribute to the Parkinsonism-like side effects. Because BCPP+ and its reduced analogue have been shown to possess the potential to destroy dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatum, we have designed new analogues of haloperidol lacking the structural features necessary to form neurotoxic quaternary species but retaining their dopamine-binding capacity. The most potent agent at the D2 receptor, the homopiperidine analogue 11, was found to be equipotent to haloperidol. It was also of interest to identify analogues with DA binding profiles similar to that of clozapine at the dopamine receptor subtypes. Evaluation of the proposed agents shows that the ratio of D2 to D4 (2) binding of clozapine was mimicked by 7 [K(i)(D2) = 33, K(i)(D3) = 200, K(i)(D4) = 11 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 3] and 9 [K(i)(D2) = 44, K(i)(D3) = 170, K(i)(D4) = 24 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 2]. A preliminary in-vivo testing of compound 7 shows that its behavioral profile is similar to that of clozapine. This profile suggests that there is a need for further evaluation of these two synthetic agents and their enantiomers for efficacy and lack of catalepsy in animal models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671515,20210802,3559|9906978|9975463|11199716|11200115|11257780|11303835|11325428|11338272|11382826|11428871|11474752|135398737,103165765|103167216|103391817|103391818|103391819|103392132|103392133|103392134|103392135|103392137|103392158|103392256|103392257,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14736232,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, recent work on D2 knock out mice suggests that haloperidol's EPS may be related to its potent D2 binding (K(i)=0.9 nM).

Our interest has focused on neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms in a search for medications for cocaine abuse.

Toward a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis._||_Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and death, most often from respiratory failure. The only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of ALS, riluzole, only extends the median survival in patients by 2-3 months. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease. Using a high-throughput screening assay targeting an ALS cultured cell model (PC12-G93A-YFP cell line), we previously identified three chemotypes that were neuroprotective. We present a further detailed analysis of one promising scaffold from that group, pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones (PYTs), characterizing a number of PYT analogues using SAR and ADME. The PYT compounds show good potency, superior ADME data, low toxicity, brain penetration, and excellent oral bioavailability. Compounds from this series show 100% efficacy in the protection assay with a good correlation in activity between the protection and protein aggregation assays. The modifications of the PYT scaffold presented here suggest that this chemical structure may be a novel drug candidate scaffold for use in clinical trials in ALS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1769319,20180918,2187415,131285791,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21375347,0,,P35462,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some other minor structural changes among 9a-s were also found to switch binding selectivity from CB(1) receptors to TSPO or vice versa.

This perspective reviews these interconnected aspects of polypharmacology. The first part discusses the relevance of polypharmacology for the safety of drugs, the mitigation of safety risks, and methods to identify polypharmacological compounds early in the drug discovery process.

Thus, selective D4 ligands may be useful in treating some of these conditions. Previous studies in our laboratory have indicated that the piperazine analog of haloperidol exhibits selective and increased affinity to the DAD4 receptor subtype, in comparison to its piperidine analog. This led to further exploration of the piperazine moiety to identify new agents that are selective at the D4 receptor. Compound 27 (KiD4=0.84 nM) was the most potent of the compounds tested. However, it only had moderate selectivity for the D4 receptor. Compound 28 (KiD4=3.9 nM) while not as potent, was more discriminatory for the D4 receptor subtype. In fact, compound 28 has little or no binding affinity to any of the other four DA receptor subtypes. In addition, of the 23 CNS receptors evaluated, only two, 5HT1AR and 5HT2BR, have binding affinity constants better than 100 nM (Ki <100 nM).

However, the majority of the nNOS inhibitors developed are arginine mimetics and, therefore, suffer from poor bioavailability. We designed a novel strategy to combine a more pharmacokinetically favorable 2-imidazolylpyrimidine head with promising structural components from previous inhibitors. In conjunction with extensive structure-activity studies, several highly potent and selective inhibitors of nNOS were discovered. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that these type II inhibitors utilize the same hydrophobic pocket to gain strong inhibitory potency (13), as well as high isoform selectivity.

929,1272383,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to D3 dopamine receptor (unknown origin) by competition binding assay,"Title: Receptor binding profiles and quantitative structure-affinity relationships of some 5-substituted-N,N-diallyltryptamines._||_Abstract: N,N-Diallyltryptamine (DALT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) are two tryptamines synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin. In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values. At the σ2 receptor, higher affinity was correlated with increasing π. These correlations should aid in the development of more potent and selective drugs within this family of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756491,20200623,24839550|50878551|127026052|127036186|127036932|127036953,174496429|336866908|336883200|336884944|336884983|336885079,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26739781,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The atypical DAT inhibitors have received attention due to their promising pharmacological profiles in animal models of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse.

We extended SAR by chemically manipulating the oxidation states of the sulfoxide and the amide functional groups, halogenating the phenyl rings, and/or functionalizing the terminal nitrogen with substituted piperazines, resulting in several novel leads such as 11b, which demonstrated high DAT affinity (Ki = 2.5 nM) and selectivity without producing concomitant locomotor stimulation in mice, as compared to cocaine.

Such compounds will be valuable to evaluate as anti-cocaine therapeutics. Towards that eventual goal, we engaged an SAR study in which a series of C9 alkoxy analogues of the D1/D2/D3 ligand (-)-stepholidine that possessed or lacked a C12 bromo functionality, were synthesized and evaluated for affinity at dopamine D1, D2 and D3 receptors. We found that the analogues are generally selective for the D1 receptor. Small n-alkoxy substituents (up to 4 carbons in length) were generally well tolerated for high D1 affinity but such groups reduced D3 affinity. In the case of C12 brominated analogues, C9 alkoxylation also had little effect on D1 affinity for the smaller alkoxy groups, but reduced D2 and D3 affinities significantly. C12 bromination tends to increase D1 receptor selectivity. A number of compounds were identified that retain affinity for D1 and D3 receptors but lack D2 receptor affinity. Among them, compound 22a was found to be a selective D1/D3 dual antagonist (Ki = 5.3 and 106 nM at D1 and D3 receptors). Docking studies performed on the analogues at the D3 receptor revealed a number of interactions that are important for affinity including a critical N - Asp110 salt bridge motif, H-bonds to Ser192 and Cys181 and hydrophobic interactions between the aryl rings and Phe106 and Phe345.

The compounds generally displayed strong affinity for D3R with very good D3R selectivity. Docking studies at D2R and D3R crystal structures revealed that the molecules are oriented such that their arylamine units are positioned in the orthosteric binding pocket of D3R, with the arylamide 'tail' units residing in the secondary binding pocket. Hydrogen bonding between Ser 182 and Tyr 365 at D3R stabilize extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which in turn contributes to ligand binding by interacting with the 'tail' units of the ligands in the secondary binding pocket. Similar interactions between ECL2 and the 'tail' units were absent at D2R due to different positioning of the D2R loop region.

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations.

While their identification has long been the result of serendipity, medicinal chemistry now tends to design polypharmacology. Modern in vitro pharmacological methods and chemical probes allow a systematic search for rational target combinations and recent innovations in computational technologies, crystallography, or fragment-based design equip multitarget compound development with valuable tools.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9).

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

1074,652052,Summary,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Antagonist: Summary,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment._||_The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease.
