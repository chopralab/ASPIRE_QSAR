This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670422,20181016,54562,103543557,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Targetting high affinity and D(3) versus D(2) receptor-preferring ligands, the partial agonist BP 897 was taken as a lead structure. Variations in the spacer and the aryl moiety led to N-alkylated 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)piperazines with markedly improved affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the structural development. Pharmacophore models for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor ligands were developed from their potentially bioactive conformation and were compared in order to get insight into molecular properties of importance for D(2)/D(3) receptor selectivity. For the 72 compounds presented here, an extended and more linear conformation in the aliphatic or aryl spacers turned out to be crucial for dopamine D(3) receptor selectivity. Structural diversity in the aryl moiety (benzamides, heteroarylamides, arylimides) had a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D(3) receptor affinity, which was optimized with more rigid aryl acrylamide derivatives.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels. These agents should be of therapeutic value in treating disorders resulting from hypo- and hyperdopaminergic activity, without the side effects associated with complete D2 agonism or antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL675055,20181015,44356252,103371645,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9435894,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

The structural contributions to D2/D3 and 5-HT1A receptor binding of the aminopyrimidine, cycloalkyl, and phenylpiperazine portions of the molecule were examined. From these studies compounds 14, 39, 42, 43, having potent affinity for both DA D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, were evaluated for intrinsic activity at these receptors, in vitro and in vivo. Compound 14 (PD 158771) had a profile indicative of partial agonist activity at both D2 and 5-HT1A receptors causing partially decreased synthesis of the neurotransmitters DA and 5-HT and their metabolites.

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL676636,20181016,9904074|10220541|10590717|10637198|10780928,103345940|103345942|103345968|103345969|103346651,1814,In vitro,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,,P35462,,198.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670710,20181017,5202,103165719,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930145,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects.

Starting from 2-benzyl-imidazoline screening hits, a series of structurally related 2-benzyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazoles was investigated first, but it proved highly challenging to obtain compounds having sufficient selectivity against the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor. This issue could be successfully addressed by modification of the linker region and SAR exploration led to the discovery of highly selective isopropyl-substituted 4-aminomethyl-imidazole compounds. The work culminated in the identification of the selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5073012 (4-chlorophenyl)-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-isopropyl-amine, 24), which has a good pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration in rodents. RO5073012 has been found to be active in a behavioural rat model which is considered indicative for schizophrenia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2215966,20180924,24781869,163329089,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22795332,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

The major drawback of C-11 tracers is the lack of cyclotron facility in many health care centers thereby limiting widespread clinical or research use. We identified the fluoroethyl derivative, 2-(4-(4-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione (FECUMI-101) (Ki=0.1nM; Emax=77%; EC50=0.65nM) as a partial agonist 5-HT1AR ligand of the parent ligand CUMI-101. FECUMI-101 is radiolabeled with F-18 by O-fluoroethylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue (1) with [(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate in DMSO in the presence of 1.6equiv of K2CO3 in 45±5% yield (EOS). PET shows [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binds specifically to 5-HT1AR enriched brain regions of baboon. The specificity of [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binding to 5-HT1AR was confirmed by challenge studies with the known 5-HT1AR ligand WAY100635. These findings indicate that [(18)F]FECUMI-101 can be a viable agonist ligand for the in vivo quantification of high affinity 5-HT1AR with PET.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2416735,20200629,21830793|73346042,174487458|174487459,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23816046,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

With the aim to bias their hydrophilicity and to optimize their D4 receptor affinity and selectivity, a concise series of triazoles containing fluoroalkyl, fluoroalkoxy, fluoroalkoxyphenyl, and deoxyfluoroglucosyl substituents was studied. The D4 receptor affinity and selectivity could be tuned by altering the chemical moiety attached to the triazole unit. Among the test compounds, the fluoroethoxyphenyl derivative 15b showed weak partial agonism at D4 and a K(i) value of 14 nM, while its fluoropropoxyphenyl homologue 16a turned out to act as a neutral D4 antagonist (K(i)=5.1 nM). Both, 15b and 16a revealed an excellent balance between D4 receptor affinity and subtype selectivity, providing lead candidates for the development of (18)F-labeled radioligands for D4 receptor imaging studies by positron emission tomography (PET).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2443401,20180928,44412269|72544566|72544787|72544789|72545007|72545008|72545009|72545010|72545011|72545238|72545239|72545240,103489982|174489343|174489344|174494364|174494365|174499533|174499534|174504767|174504768|174515048|174515049|174515050,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24100078,0,,P35462,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

A common molecular template used in the development of D3R-selective antagonists and partial agonists incorporates a butylamide linker between two pharmacophores, a phenylpiperazine moiety and an extended aryl ring system. The series of compounds described herein incorporates a change to that chemical template, replacing the amide functional group in the linker chain with a 1,2,3-triazole group. Although the amide linker in the 4-phenylpiperazine class of D3R ligands has been previously deemed critical for high D3R affinity and selectivity, the 1,2,3-triazole moiety serves as a suitable bioisosteric replacement and maintains desired D3R-binding functionality of the compounds. Additionally, using mouse liver microsomes to evaluate CYP450-mediated phase I metabolism, we determined that novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing compounds modestly improves metabolic stability compared to amide-containing analogues.

Analogues 5-10 were rationally designed and prepared to evaluate whether electronic and/or lipophilic properties of substituents in the ortho position of its phenoxy moiety exert any favorable effects on the affinity/activity at 5-HT1A receptor and improve selectivity over α1-ARs. To rationalize the experimental observations and derive information about receptor-ligand interactions of the reported ligands, docking studies, using 5-HT1A and α1d-AR models generated by homology techniques, and a retrospective computational study were performed. The results highlighted that proper substituents in position 2 of the phenoxy moiety of 3 selectively address the ligands toward 5-HT1A receptor with respect to α1-ARs and D2-like receptor subtypes.

Starting from recently discovered hydroxy-substituted heterocyclic piperazine scaffolds, we have developed a series of dopamine D2 receptor ligands with a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine as secondary pharmacophore that is functionalized in position 3 by a formyl or hydroxyiminomethyl substituent. The ligands, especially the benzoxazinone 9d, were found to stimulate substantial β-arrestin-2 recruitment, while being nearly devoid of activity in a GTPγS binding assay. Investigating a new series of truncated analogs lacking a secondary pharmacophore, considerable β-arrestin-2 recruitment in the absence of G protein activation was found, when a 5-hydroxy-2H-benzo[b][1,4]oxazin-3(4H)-one was combined with an N-propyl-substituted 1,4-diazepane (15c).

Two isoquinoline derivatives, 1-(2'-bromobenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-N-methyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Br-BTHIQ, 1) and 1,2-demethyl-nuciferine (aporphine, 2), were herein synthesized, and their dopaminergic affinity in cloned human D2R, D3R, and D4R subtypes and their behavior as agonists/antagonists were evaluated. They showed affinity values (Ki) for hD2, hD3, and hD4 DR within the nanomolar range. The trends in affinity were hD4R ≫ hD3R > hD2R for Br-BTHIQ (1) and hD2R > hD4R > hD3R for 1,2-demethyl-nuciferine (2). The functional assays of cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling at human D2R showed a partial agonist effect for Br-BTHIQ (1) and full agonist behavior for aporphine (2), with half maximal effective concentration values of 2.95 and 10.2 μM, respectively.

This suggested that the binding conformation of the aminoethyl side chain at this receptor was toward the 4-position of the indole ring and was supported by the fact that the 4-(aminoethyl)indoles (45) also displayed high affinity, as did the conformationally rigid 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[c,d]indole (49). Molecular modeling showed that 19, 43, and 45 all had low-energy conformers that overlaid well onto 49.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation.

Optimization of in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo activity in rodent models of psychosis has led to compound 24, which showed good affinities for human D(2), D(3), and 5-HT(1A) receptors but significantly less affinity for human alpha(1) adrenoceptors and rat H(1) and muscarinic receptors. In rodents, 24 showed functional D(2)-like antagonism and 5-HT(1A) partial agonism. After oral dosing, 24 showed good activity in rodent antipsychotic tests and very little potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), as measured by its ability to induce catalepsy in rats only at very high doses. In the light of this promising profile of activity, 24 has been selected for clinical investigation as a novel antipsychotic agent with a predicted low propensity to cause EPS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL674837,20181016,9865858,103337393,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10464021,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL676637,20181016,119570,103245538,1814,In vitro,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,,P35462,,198.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670711,20181017,5202,103165719,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930145,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

In these studies, a discrepancy between in vitro binding affinity, in vivo occupancy, and behavioral potency has been observed. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) modifications of the 2-pyridylphenyl moiety of 6 and (2) hydroxyl, acetyl, and cyclopropyl substitutions on the butylamide linking chain systematically coupled with 2-fluorenylamide or 2-pyridylphenylamide and 2-methoxy- or 2,3-dichloro-substituted phenylpiperazines to measure the impact on binding affinity, D2/D3 selectivity, lipophilicity, and function.

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167813,20180923,851833|10454026|10456166|42626318,103356575|103402070|124969027|163329505,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,,P35462,9606.0,54.0,,,0,1,0,1,0,0

Heterocyclic dopamine surrogates comprising a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine moiety were synthesized and investigated for their binding properties when low- to subnanomolar K(i) values were determined for D(2L), D(2S), and D3 receptors. Measurement of [(35)S]GTPγS incorporation at D(2S) coexpressed with G-protein subunits indicated significant bias for promotion of Gα(o1) over Gα(i2) coupling for several test compounds.

Exploitation of the original structure-activity relationships resulted in the identification of safe and effective antipsychotics devoid of extrapyramidal symptoms liability, sedation, and catalepsy. The potential atypical antipsychotic 5bb was selected for further pharmacological investigation. The distribution of c-fos positive cells in the ventral striatum confirmed the atypical antipsychotic profile of 5bb in agreement with behavioral rodent studies. 5bb administered orally demonstrated a biphasic effect on the MK801-induced hyperactivity at dose levels not able to induce sedation, catalepsy, or learning impairment in passive avoidance. In microdialysis studies, 5bb increased the dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, 5bb represents a valuable lead for the development of atypical antipsychotics endowed with a unique pharmacological profile for addressing negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3381714,20181005,5073|60795|11350623|11494093|11501253|11501537|11537385|11567578|11567928|11603119|11603486|11625642|11638640|11639248|11676638|11696813|24769156|34257212|51122451|57456630|57873490|57873491|57873492|57873499|57873504|57873508|57873513|57873515|57873518|57873520|57873522|57873525|57873527|57873531|60204111|60204112|118722639|118722912|118722913|118722914|118722915|135398737|135398745,103165765|103170825|103195217|103307946|103627886|312371860|312371861|312371862|312371863|312371864|312371865|312371866|312371867|312371868|312371869|312372258|312372259|312372260|312372261|312372262|312372263|312372264|312372265|312372266|312372267|312372268|312372269|312372270|312372271|312372272|312372273|312372274|312372275|312372276|312372277|312372278|312372279|312372280|312372281|312372282|312372283|312372284|312372285,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25343529,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations.

Off-target binding affinities, functional efficacies, and metabolic profiles revealed critical structural components for D<sub>3</sub>R selectivity as well as drug-like features required for development as pharmacotherapeutics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4415925,20210302,130431288|130431289|130431291|130431294|130431295|130431296|130431306|130431314|130431315|130431316|130431318|130431319|130431328|130431329|146451658|146451661|146451664|146451691,440111877|440122026|440126918|440139378|440141145|440141550|440152147|440154984|440157158|440159640|440160522|440166730|440172590|440189513|440195867|440197499|440212978|440220383,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31526003,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0
652049,Summary,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Potentiators: Summary,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment._||_The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. This part of the project aims to discover novel potentiators._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: MH094203_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley, NINDS",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),D3Pot000,20130312,,,1814,,NP_387512,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0
