This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670422,20181016,54562,103543557,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model. The present study contributes to the SAR of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines, and the 2-TfO analogues of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines are promising candidates as clozapine-like atypical antipsychotics with low propensity to induce EPS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670578,20181016,10828627|15521599|24121307|135493554|135508767|135515198|135686415,103269761|103269810|103269811|103269963|103270113|103270149|103270185,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10377229,0,,P35462,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Optimization studies were carried out on 8 with the aim of achieving 1000-fold selectivity for hD(4) over all other receptors while retaining the good pharmacokinetic properties of the lead. After initial preparation of 8 as a minor component in a low-yielding reaction, a novel and regioselective 'four-step/one-pot' procedure was developed which proved to be applicable to rapid investigation of the SAR of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one ring. Various changes to substituents attached to the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one core of 8 did not significantly improve selectivity for hD(4) over hD(2) and hD(3).

Target compounds were tested for binding to cloned human dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptor subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K-1 cells. A number of compounds demonstrated subnanomolar Ki values for binding to the D4 receptor, with several 100-fold selectivities toward the D2 and D3 receptors. Several compounds with combined D3/D4 receptor binding selectivity were also identified. A limited structure-activity relationship study of this chemical series is discussed. In a mitogenesis functional assay, the effect of the test compounds on cellular uptake of [3H]thymidine in D4-transfected CHO 10,001 cells was measured and compared to the response of the full dopamine agonist quinpirole. The activity of the compounds varied from full antagonist to weak partial agonist activity (intrinsic activity of 0-19% in comparison to quinpirole).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673442,20181015,3559|9948461|9948965|10315310|10447709|10450892|10494394|10498972|10518406|10588194|10589218|10590285|10615787|10638052|10684706|10708280|10732925|10734727|10758004|10780510|10780942|10805355|135398737,103165765|103167216|103189602|103363609|103363611|103363808|103363828|103363891|103363893|103363899|103363918|103363922|103363949|103364010|103364038|103364039|103364100|103364101|103364142|103364237|103364507|103364550|103364591,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9406594,0,,P35462,,198.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

However, definitive behavioral investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly selective D3 agonists and antagonists. In an attempt to design a novel class of D3 ligands with which to study this receptor system, a series of chemically divergent compounds that possessed various structural features that exist within several classes of reputed D3 agents was screened and compared to the recently reported NGB 2904 (58b). On the basis of these results, a novel series of compounds was designed that included functional moieties that were required for high-affinity and selective binding to D3 receptors. All the compounds in this series included an aryl-substituted piperazine ring, a varying alkyl chain linker (C3-C5), and a terminal aryl amide. The compounds were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for binding in CHO cells transfected with human D2, D3, or D4 receptor cDNAs. D3 binding affinities ranged from K(i) = 1.4 to 1460 nM. The most potent analogue in this series, 51, demonstrated a D3/D2 selectivity of 64 and a D3/D4 selectivity of 1300. Structure-activity relationships for this class of ligands at D3 receptors will provide new leads toward the development of highly selective and potent molecular probes that will prove useful in the elucidation of the role D3 receptors play in the psychomotor stimulant and reinforcing properties of cocaine.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673446,20181017,1687|53389|410922|3929516|9797306|9976807|9980760|10003334|10073022|10436285|10544865|10711859|10739946|10885524|10927750|10972865|10983150|11005852|11026289|11133385|11431895|11762743|11812065|11812838|12066264|12066265|12071089|12997412|12997413|21460314|24810004|24848444|44321001|44337659|44337675|44337705|44337709|44337725|44338149|44338248,103172853|103172946|103172953|103173061|103173857|103252206|103264934|103264935|103265436|103265479|103265481|103265519|103265733|103265758|103270704|103294104|103301311|103313776|103328472|103328497|103328555|103328573|103328577|103328604|103328617|103328884|103328913|103328935|103328978|103328980|103329001|103329017|103329284|103329339|103329383|103329511|103329593|103329698|194144760|194179160,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11543687,0,,P35462,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The novel compounds were characterized as dopaminergic antagonists or inverse agonists.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation.

Four separate parts of the molecule have been examined systematically to explore structure-activity relationships with respect to hD4 affinity and selectivity over other dopamine receptors. It was found that the 4-chlorophenyl group attached to the pyrazole is optimal, as is the 4-substituted piperidine. The lipophilic group on the basic nitrogen is more amenable to change, with the optimal group found to be a phenethyl. The aromatic heterocyle can be altered to a number of different groups, with isoxazoles and pyrimidines showing improved affinities. This heterocycle can also be advantageously alkylated, improving the selectivity of the compounds over D2 receptors. It is hypothesized that the conformation around the bond joining the aromatic heterocycle to the piperidine is important for D4 affinity, based on crystal structures of isoxazoles (29 and 30) and on a conformationally constrained compound (28). Putting all the favorable changes together led to the discovery that 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)iso xazole (36) is a nanomolar antagonist at human dopamine D4 receptors with > 500-fold selectivity over hD2 and > 200-fold selectivity over hD3.

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL676636,20181016,9904074|10220541|10590717|10637198|10780928,103345940|103345942|103345968|103345969|103346651,1814,In vitro,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,,P35462,,198.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

The affinities of the compounds for [3H]raclopride-labeled cloned human dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors as well as [3H]-8-OH-DPAT-labeled rat hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors were determined. In order to selectively determine affinities for the high-affinity agonist binding site at DA D2 receptors, the agonist [3H]quinpirole was used. The intrinsic activities of the compounds at DA D2 and D3 receptors were evaluated in a [35S]GTP gamma S binding assay. The novel compounds were characterized as dopaminergic antagonists or inverse agonists. The antagonist (R)-2-(butylpropylamino)-5-fluorotetralin (16) bound with high affinity (Ki = 4.4 nM) to the DA D3 receptor and was the most D3-selective compound (10-fold). (R)-2-[[4-(8-Aza-7, 9-dioxospiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)butyl]propylamino]-5-fluorote tralin (18) bound with very high affinity to both DA D3 and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.2 nM) and was also characterized as a dopaminergic antagonist. (R)-2-(Benzylpropylamino)-5-fluorotetralin (10) behaved as an inverse agonist at both DA D2 and D3 receptors. It decreased the basal [35S]GTP gamma S binding and potently inhibited the DA-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding.

However, a major disadvantage of many current medications are the observed extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), postulated to arise from D(2) receptor antagonism. Consequently, a selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist could offer an attractive antipsychotic therapy, devoid of the unwanted EPS. Using SAR information gained in two previously reported series of potent and selective D(3) receptor antagonists, as exemplified by the 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine 10 and the 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindoline 11, a range of 7-sulfonyloxy- and 7-sulfonylbenzazepines has been prepared. Compounds of this type combined a high level of D(3) affinity and selectivity vs D(2) with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in the rat.

This compound is a potent and selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist with high oral bioavailability and is CNS penetrant in the rat. Subsequent evaluation in the rat has shown that 58 preferentially reduces firing of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (A10) compared to the substantia nigra (A9), an observation consistent with a prediction for atypical antipsychotic efficacy.

(S)-Phenylpiperidines having an aromatic substituent with a high group dipole moment in the 3-position, i.e., meta with respect to the piperidine ring, and being N-substituted with a propyl group were found to be highly active in vivo on the synthesis and turnover of dopamine. However, they do not induce strong hypoactivity or catalepsy. Interestingly, the most active compounds in vivo were found to display only low affinity for DA D2 and D3 receptors in vitro.

In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670710,20181017,5202,103165719,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930145,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Previous synthetic studies provided structural requirements for high affinity binding to D(3) receptors which included a 2,3-dichloro-phenylpiperazine linked to an arylamido function via a butyl chain. To reduce lipophilicity of these agents and further investigate optimal conformation, a second series of 15 novel ligands was designed that included heteroaromatic substitution and unsaturated alkyl linkers. These compounds were synthesized and evaluated for binding at rat D(3) and D(2) receptors stably expressed in Sf9 cells. D(3) binding affinities ranged from K(i)=0.6-1080 nM, with a broad range of D(3)/D(2) selectivities (2-97). The discovery of potent, selective and bioavailable D(3) receptor ligands will provide essential molecular probes to elucidate the role D(3) receptors play in the psychomotor stimulant and reinforcing effects of cocaine.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL842029,20180930,44309775,103265917,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12798330,0,,P35462,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Generally, hydroxylation and chlorination of the dibenz-azecines increased affinities significantly. 1-Chloro-2-hydroxy-hexahydro-dibenz[d,g]azecine was a subnanomolar antagonist at both subtype families. 4-Chloro-3-hydroxy-7-methyl-5,6,7,8,9,14-hexahydro-dibenz[d,g]azecine was identified as the most potent and selective dopamine D5 receptor ligand described to date with Ki(D1)=0.83, Ki(D2L)=4.0, Ki(D3)=24.6, Ki(D4)=5.2 nM, and Ki(D5)=57 pM (radioligand binding experiments), respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL861437,20181020,4350931|11493746|11500677|11522339|11536995|11558055|11558247|11573628|11573806|11595240|11623343|11681599|11716438|11718008|44408818,103256967|103477539|103481695|103481972|103482013|103482038|103482039|103482208|103482210|103482492|103482498|103482499|103482500|103482509|103482535,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16539400,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The most potent compounds exhibited K(i) values toward the D(3) receptor in the nano- to subnanomolar range and high selectivity versus the related D(2) dopamine receptor. Thus, 1H-pyridin-2-one 7b displays oral bioavailability (F=37%) as well as brain penetration (brain plasma ratio 3.7) in rat. Within the urea series, an excellent D(3) versus D(2) selectivity (>100-fold) could be achieved by removal of one NH group (compound 6), although bioavailability (rat) was suboptimal (F<10%).

Moreover, we have discovered some of the most D3-selective compounds reported to date that show high affinity (K(i) = 1 nM) for D3 and approximately 400-fold selectivity over the D2 receptor subtype.

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor.

The molecule conformational flexibility in the series is restricted by formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between 3-sulfo and 2-methylamino groups, which renders high potency and high selectivity to block serotonin-induced responses in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human 5-HT(6)R. In this work, we tested the hypothesis if addition of a positively ionizable group (PI) to the pyrimidine ring of the scaffold members in positions 5, 6, or 7 could further increase their 5HT(6)R blocking potency. We show that the presence of the PI group with small substituents does not substantially affect either potency or selectivity of the ligands while causing substantial changes in their cLogP values. This provides a possibility for designing of the 5HT(6)R ligands with modified ADME characteristics without grossly affecting efficiency of their interaction with the receptor.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425053,20181006,219077,103399782,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,,P35462,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A common molecular template used in the development of D3R-selective antagonists and partial agonists incorporates a butylamide linker between two pharmacophores, a phenylpiperazine moiety and an extended aryl ring system. The series of compounds described herein incorporates a change to that chemical template, replacing the amide functional group in the linker chain with a 1,2,3-triazole group. Although the amide linker in the 4-phenylpiperazine class of D3R ligands has been previously deemed critical for high D3R affinity and selectivity, the 1,2,3-triazole moiety serves as a suitable bioisosteric replacement and maintains desired D3R-binding functionality of the compounds. Additionally, using mouse liver microsomes to evaluate CYP450-mediated phase I metabolism, we determined that novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing compounds modestly improves metabolic stability compared to amide-containing analogues. The 1,2,3-triazole moiety allows for the modular attachment of chemical subunit libraries using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry, increasing the range of chemical entities that can be designed, synthesized, and developed toward D3R-selective therapeutic agents.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3591125,20181008,25141534|72190766|118719792|122180568|122180569|122180570|122180571|122180572|122180573|122180574|122180575|122180576|122180610|122180611|122180612|122180613|122180614|122180615|122180616|122180617|122180618|122180619|122180620|122180621|122180622|122180623|122180624|122180625|122180626|122180627|122181005|122181006|122181007,124966353|174493497|312367617|318375884|318375885|318375886|318375887|318375888|318375889|318375890|318375891|318375892|318375953|318375954|318375955|318375956|318375957|318375958|318375959|318375960|318375961|318375962|318375963|318375964|318375965|318375966|318375967|318375968|318375969|318375970|318376629|318376630|318376631,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25650314,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

This highly potent molecular scaffold was developed from an inactive diarylpyridine-2-amine derivative 3b by extensive and systematic analogue synthesis and SAR analysis. Further optimization of the scaffold resulted in identification of pyridin-2(1H)-one 18b as a lead compound with good potency (IC50 = 1.6 nM) and selectivity (>6000-fold) over other related PDEs but with a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Careful metabolite profiling of 18b revealed that poor systemic exposure in rats (Cmax = 44 ng/mL; AUC0-t = 359 ng · h/mL) at 10 mg/kg was due to the formation of O-glucuronide conjugate by phase 2 metabolism. The structure of the glucuronide metabolite was confirmed by retention time and LC-MS/MS fragmentation matching with the synthetic glucuronide 26.

In contrast, the N-5-alkyl-substituted analogues, and notably the n-butyl-arylamides (22b and 22c), all showed improved affinity at D2R over 1 with neither a loss of efficacy nor an increase in selectivity.

Such compounds will be valuable to evaluate as anti-cocaine therapeutics. Towards that eventual goal, we engaged an SAR study in which a series of C9 alkoxy analogues of the D1/D2/D3 ligand (-)-stepholidine that possessed or lacked a C12 bromo functionality, were synthesized and evaluated for affinity at dopamine D1, D2 and D3 receptors. We found that the analogues are generally selective for the D1 receptor. Small n-alkoxy substituents (up to 4 carbons in length) were generally well tolerated for high D1 affinity but such groups reduced D3 affinity. In the case of C12 brominated analogues, C9 alkoxylation also had little effect on D1 affinity for the smaller alkoxy groups, but reduced D2 and D3 affinities significantly. C12 bromination tends to increase D1 receptor selectivity. A number of compounds were identified that retain affinity for D1 and D3 receptors but lack D2 receptor affinity. Among them, compound 22a was found to be a selective D1/D3 dual antagonist (Ki = 5.3 and 106 nM at D1 and D3 receptors). Docking studies performed on the analogues at the D3 receptor revealed a number of interactions that are important for affinity including a critical N - Asp110 salt bridge motif, H-bonds to Ser192 and Cys181 and hydrophobic interactions between the aryl rings and Phe106 and Phe345.

In vitro evaluation allowed to identify compound 17 (2-ethyl-3-(3-fluorobenzyl)-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) as potent 5-HT6 receptor partial inverse agonist in Gs signaling (Ki = 6 nM, IC50 = 17.6 nM). Compound 17 displayed high metabolic stability, favorable cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (2D6, 3A4) profile, did not affect PgP-protein binding, without evoking mutagenic effects. It was orally bioavailable and brain penetrant. In contrast to intepirdine (SB-742457), which prevented 5-HT6R-elicited neurite growth and behaved as an inverse agonist of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), compound 17 has no influence on neuronal differentiation. Compound 17 exerted significant pro-cognitive properties in novel object recognition (NOR) task in rats reversing both phencyclidine- and scopolamine-induced memory deficits (MED = 1 and 0.3 mg/kg, p.o, respectively).

We have explored the structure-activity relationship of a 3-(4-phenyl-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5-(aryl)benzoic acid antagonist scaffold, assisted by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a P2Y14R homology model. A computational pipeline using the High Throughput MD Python environment guided the analogue design. Selection of candidates was based upon ligand-protein shape and complementarity and the persistence of ligand-protein interactions over time. Predictions of a favorable substitution of a 5-phenyl group with thiophene and an insertion of a three-methylene spacer between the 5-aromatic and alkyl amino moieties were largely consistent with empirical results. The substitution of a key carboxylate group on the core phenyl ring with tetrazole or truncation of the 5-aryl group reduced affinity. The most potent antagonists, using a fluorescent assay, were a primary 3-aminopropyl congener 20 (MRS4458) and phenyl p-carboxamide 30 (MRS4478).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4189963,20200618,126720252,404686172,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767967,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A decade of medicinal chemistry efforts has led to several promising ligands, although the chemical structures described so far possesses a singular limited diversity. We report here the discovery of novel structures, belonging to completely different scaffolds. The virtual screening was planed as a two-steps process. First, using a 'scout screening' methodology, we have experimentally probed the H4R ligand binding site using a small size chemical library with very diverse structures, and identified a hit that further assist us in refining a raw 3D homology model. Second, the refined 3D model was used to conduct a widened virtual screening. This two-steps strategy proved to be very successful, both in terms of structural diversity and hit rate (23%).

The most potent ligand, 1-(5-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)pentyl)azepane (11) displayed high affinity for the histamine H3 receptor with a Ki value of 21.9 nM. The antagonist behaviour of 11 was confirmed both in vitro in the cAMP assay (IC50 = 312 nM) and in vivo in the rat dipsogenia model (ED50 = 3.68 nM). Moreover, compound 11 showed positive effects on scopolamine induced-memory deficits in mice (at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg) and an analgesic effect in the formalin test in mice with ED50 = 30.6 mg/kg (early phase) and ED50 = 20.8 mg/kg (late phase).

The trends in affinity were hD4R ≫ hD3R > hD2R for Br-BTHIQ (1) and hD2R > hD4R > hD3R for 1,2-demethyl-nuciferine (2). The functional assays of cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling at human D2R showed a partial agonist effect for Br-BTHIQ (1) and full agonist behavior for aporphine (2), with half maximal effective concentration values of 2.95 and 10.2 μM, respectively.

Previous work has exemplified the use of bitopic ligands as a powerful strategy in achieving subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists alike. Inspired by the potential for chemical modification of the D3 preferential agonists (+)-PD128,907 (1) and PF592,379 (2), we synthesized bitopic structures to further improve their D3R selectivity. We found that the (2S,5S) conformation of scaffold 2 resulted in a privileged architecture with increased affinity and selectivity for the D3R. In addition, a cyclopropyl moiety incorporated into the linker and full resolution of the chiral centers resulted in lead compound 53 and eutomer 53a that demonstrate significantly higher D3R binding selectivities than the reference compounds.

Three series of racemic aporphines were investigated: 1,2,10-trisubstituted, C10 N-monosubstituted and compounds containing a C10 benzofused aminothiazole moiety. The 1,2,10-trisubstituted series of compounds as a group displayed modest selectivity for 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R and also had moderate 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R affinity. Compounds from the C10 N-monosubstituted series generally lacked affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R and showed strong affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> or 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R. Compounds in this series that contained an N6-methyl group were up to 27-fold selective for 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R over 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R, whereas compounds with an N6-propyl substituent showed a reversal in this selectivity. The C10 benzofused aminothiazole analogues showed a similar binding profile as the C10 N-monosubstituted series i.e. strong affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R or 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R, with selectivity between the two receptors being similarly influenced by N6-methyl or N6-propyl substituents. Compounds 29 and 34a exhibit high 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R affinity, excellent selectivity versus dopamine receptors and function as antagonists in 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R cAMP-based assays.

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels. These agents should be of therapeutic value in treating disorders resulting from hypo- and hyperdopaminergic activity, without the side effects associated with complete D2 agonism or antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673447,20181015,44356070|44356132|44356133|44356141|44356251|44356265|44356285|44356290,103371281|103371405|103371406|103371430|103371644|103371668|103371710|103371720,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9435894,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors.

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21).

These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors.

In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670711,20181017,5202,103165719,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930145,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR.

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM).

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133).

The amine in the eastern appendage, originally required by the pharmacophore model and believed to interact with Asp123 in transmembrane 3 of MCH1R, could be removed without diminishing affinity or functional activity of the compounds.

Radiosynthesis of [(11)C]10 has been achieved by reacting 2-{4-[4-(7-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (9) and [(11)C]CH(3)OTf in 25 +/- 5% (n = 15) yield at the end of synthesis (EOS). The chemical and radiochemical purities of [(11)C]10 were >99% with a specific activity 1500 +/- 300 Ci/mmol (n =15). PET studies in anesthetized baboon demonstrate [(11)C]10 specific binding in brain regions rich in 5-HT(1A) receptors. Binding of [(11)C]10 was blocked by WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT. The regional brain volumes of distribution (V(T)) of [(11)C]10 in baboon correlate with [(11)C]WAY100635 V(T) in baboons. These data provide evidence that [(11)C]10 is the first promising agonist PET tracer for the 5-HT(1A) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL868788,20181020,11676174,103476105,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16392798,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Chlorination of 2-phenylethylamines was useful for the site direction of cyclization, but chlorine atoms were removed under Birch conditions so that chlorination had to be repeated to get the respective chlorinated dibenz[d,g]azecines. The target compounds were tested for their affinity at the different human-cloned dopamine-receptor subtypes (D1 family, D2 family). Generally, hydroxylation and chlorination of the dibenz-azecines increased affinities significantly. 1-Chloro-2-hydroxy-hexahydro-dibenz[d,g]azecine was a subnanomolar antagonist at both subtype families. 4-Chloro-3-hydroxy-7-methyl-5,6,7,8,9,14-hexahydro-dibenz[d,g]azecine was identified as the most potent and selective dopamine D5 receptor ligand described to date with Ki(D1)=0.83, Ki(D2L)=4.0, Ki(D3)=24.6, Ki(D4)=5.2 nM, and Ki(D5)=57 pM (radioligand binding experiments), respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL861442,20181020,4350931|11493746|11500677|11522339|11536995|11558055|11558247|11573628|11573806|11595240|11623343|11681599|11716438|11718008|44408818,103256967|103477539|103481695|103481972|103482013|103482038|103482039|103482208|103482210|103482492|103482498|103482499|103482500|103482509|103482535,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16539400,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167815,20180923,5355,103164922,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,,P35462,9606.0,54.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

The final probe 65 was obtained through a quantitative high-throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, to yield a selective molecule with good in vitro physical properties, metabolic stability, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. The optimized molecule may be a useful in vivo probe for studying D2 DAR signal modulation and could also serve as a lead compound for the development of D2 DAR-selective druglike molecules for the treatment of multiple neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3239710,20181002,3559|133633|16007814|16058752|46912547|57377246|57383397|57383401|57383405|57383408|57383414|57383430|57383431|57383434|57383436,103167216|103247487|242111085|242303585|242621003|242621291|242621305|242621306|242621307|242621308|242621310|242621311|242621312|242621313|242621314,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24666157,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Heterocyclic dopamine surrogates comprising a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine moiety were synthesized and investigated for their binding properties when low- to subnanomolar K(i) values were determined for D(2L), D(2S), and D3 receptors. Measurement of [(35)S]GTPγS incorporation at D(2S) coexpressed with G-protein subunits indicated significant bias for promotion of Gα(o1) over Gα(i2) coupling for several test compounds. Functionally selective D(2S) activation was most striking for the carbaldoxime 8b (Gα(o1), pEC50 = 8.87, E(max) = 65%; Gα(i2), pEC50 = 6.63, E(max) = 27%). In contrast, the investigated 1,4-disubstituted aromatic piperazines (1,4-DAPs) behaved as antagonists for β-arrestin-2 recruitment, implying significant ligand bias for G-protein activation over β-arrestin-2 recruitment at D(2S) receptors. Ligand efficacy and selectivity between D(2S) and D3 activation were strongly influenced by regiochemistry and the nature of functional groups attached to the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine moiety.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3295082,20200618,54562|60795|11154555|25070416|25070419|25070740|25070742|25071066|25071384|25071691|25071692|25072632|25072635|25072943|25072946|90644226|90644227|90644228|90644230|136056636,103307946|103543557|160694505|242646172|242646173|242646174|242646175|242646176|242646177|242646178|242646179|242646180|242646181|242646182|242646183|242646184|242646185|242646186|242646187|242646188,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24831693,0,,P35462,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Exploitation of the original structure-activity relationships resulted in the identification of safe and effective antipsychotics devoid of extrapyramidal symptoms liability, sedation, and catalepsy. The potential atypical antipsychotic 5bb was selected for further pharmacological investigation. The distribution of c-fos positive cells in the ventral striatum confirmed the atypical antipsychotic profile of 5bb in agreement with behavioral rodent studies. 5bb administered orally demonstrated a biphasic effect on the MK801-induced hyperactivity at dose levels not able to induce sedation, catalepsy, or learning impairment in passive avoidance.

Although 1 was confirmed as a D2R-preferential agonist, its selectivity in binding and functional studies was lower than previously reported. All analogues were determined to be D2R/D3R agonists in both GoBRET and mitogenesis functional assays. Loss of efficacy was detected for the N-1-substituted analogues at D3R. In contrast, the N-5-alkyl-substituted analogues, and notably the n-butyl-arylamides (22b and 22c), all showed improved affinity at D2R over 1 with neither a loss of efficacy nor an increase in selectivity.

Since blockade of D3 and 5-HT6 (5-HT6R) receptors enhances neurocognition and social cognition, and potentially improves negative symptoms, a promising approach for improved treatment for schizophrenia would be to develop drugs that preferentially act at D3R versus D2R and likewise recognize 5-HT6R.

Such compounds will be valuable to evaluate as anti-cocaine therapeutics. Towards that eventual goal, we engaged an SAR study in which a series of C9 alkoxy analogues of the D1/D2/D3 ligand (-)-stepholidine that possessed or lacked a C12 bromo functionality, were synthesized and evaluated for affinity at dopamine D1, D2 and D3 receptors. We found that the analogues are generally selective for the D1 receptor. Small n-alkoxy substituents (up to 4 carbons in length) were generally well tolerated for high D1 affinity but such groups reduced D3 affinity. In the case of C12 brominated analogues, C9 alkoxylation also had little effect on D1 affinity for the smaller alkoxy groups, but reduced D2 and D3 affinities significantly. C12 bromination tends to increase D1 receptor selectivity. A number of compounds were identified that retain affinity for D1 and D3 receptors but lack D2 receptor affinity. Among them, compound 22a was found to be a selective D1/D3 dual antagonist (Ki = 5.3 and 106 nM at D1 and D3 receptors). Docking studies performed on the analogues at the D3 receptor revealed a number of interactions that are important for affinity including a critical N - Asp110 salt bridge motif, H-bonds to Ser192 and Cys181 and hydrophobic interactions between the aryl rings and Phe106 and Phe345.

While antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors is responsible for the alleviation of 'positive' symptoms of schizophrenia and the effects at other, particularly serotonergic receptors are necessary for their additional therapeutic effects, there is no consensus regarding an 'ideal' target engagement. Here, a detailed SAR analysis in a series of 45 novel azinesulfonamides of cyclic amine derivatives, involving the aryl-piperazine/piperidine pharmacophore, central alicyclic amine and azinesulfonamide groups has led to the selection of (S)-4-((2-(2-(4-(benzo[b]thiophen-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)sulfonyl)isoquinoline (62). The polypharmacology profile of 62, characterized by partial 5-HT1AR agonism, 5-HT2A/5-HT7/D2/D3R antagonism, and blockade of SERT, reduced the 'positive'-like, and 'negative'-like symptoms of psychoses. Compound 62 produced no catalepsy, demonstrated a low hyperprolactinemia liability and displayed pro-cognitive effects in the novel object recognition task and attentional set-shifting test. While association of in vitro features with the promising in vivo profile of 62 is still not fully established, its clinical efficacy should be verified in further stages of development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4229963,20200619,118626089,404703295,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29407591,0,,P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The compounds generally displayed strong affinity for D3R with very good D3R selectivity. Docking studies at D2R and D3R crystal structures revealed that the molecules are oriented such that their arylamine units are positioned in the orthosteric binding pocket of D3R, with the arylamide 'tail' units residing in the secondary binding pocket. Hydrogen bonding between Ser 182 and Tyr 365 at D3R stabilize extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which in turn contributes to ligand binding by interacting with the 'tail' units of the ligands in the secondary binding pocket. Similar interactions between ECL2 and the 'tail' units were absent at D2R due to different positioning of the D2R loop region.

We have rationalized the structural features conducive to activities at the main targets and investigated activities at two off-targets: dopamine receptor subtype D2 and endocannabinoid receptor CB1. To understand the unexpected affinity for the CB1 receptor, we devised a 3D-QSAR model, which we then prospectively validated.

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations.

Two isoquinoline derivatives, 1-(2'-bromobenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-N-methyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Br-BTHIQ, 1) and 1,2-demethyl-nuciferine (aporphine, 2), were herein synthesized, and their dopaminergic affinity in cloned human D2R, D3R, and D4R subtypes and their behavior as agonists/antagonists were evaluated. They showed affinity values (Ki) for hD2, hD3, and hD4 DR within the nanomolar range. The trends in affinity were hD4R ≫ hD3R > hD2R for Br-BTHIQ (1) and hD2R > hD4R > hD3R for 1,2-demethyl-nuciferine (2). The functional assays of cyclic adenosine monophosphate signaling at human D2R showed a partial agonist effect for Br-BTHIQ (1) and full agonist behavior for aporphine (2), with half maximal effective concentration values of 2.95 and 10.2 μM, respectively. Therefore, both isoquinolines 1 and 2 have emerged as lead molecules for the synthesis of new therapeutic drugs that ultimately may be useful to prevent schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4344299,20210302,3559|151086|135398737|155568278,103165765|103167216|174513404|440226799,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31933369,0,,P35462,9606.0,198.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Previous work has exemplified the use of bitopic ligands as a powerful strategy in achieving subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists alike. Inspired by the potential for chemical modification of the D3 preferential agonists (+)-PD128,907 (1) and PF592,379 (2), we synthesized bitopic structures to further improve their D3R selectivity. We found that the (2S,5S) conformation of scaffold 2 resulted in a privileged architecture with increased affinity and selectivity for the D3R. In addition, a cyclopropyl moiety incorporated into the linker and full resolution of the chiral centers resulted in lead compound 53 and eutomer 53a that demonstrate significantly higher D3R binding selectivities than the reference compounds.

This is why it is best treated with multi-target drugs, such as second generation antipsychotics. Here we present 5-substituted-3-(1-arylmethyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-4-yl)-1H-indoles (1-20) which are ligands of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> and serotonin 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors and display affinity in the nanomolar range. These compounds were designed as modifications of the virtual hit experimentally confirmed, D2AAK1, and synthesized from indole or 5-alkoxyindoles and N-substituted piperidin-4-ones in methanol in the presence of potassium hydroxide. Compound 9 was subjected to X-ray studies and it crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P2<sub>1</sub>/c with one molecule in an asymmetric unit. Three most potent compounds (5, 9 and 17) turned out to be antagonists of both D<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors what is beneficial for their potential application as antipsychotics. Compound 5 was subjected to behavioral studies and exhibited antipsychotic, pro-cognitive and antidepressant activity in appropriate mice models. Structure-activity relationships for compounds 1-20 were rationalized using molecular docking. It was found that, in general, bulky C5-alkoxy substituents at the indole moiety are not favorable as they direct towards aqueous environment of the extracellular vestibule.

Novel D4R-selective ligands have promise in medication development for neuropsychiatric conditions, including Alzheimer's disease and substance use disorders. To identify new D4R-selective ligands, and to understand the molecular determinants of agonist efficacy at D4R, we report a series of eighteen novel ligands based on the classical D4R agonist A-412997 (1, 2-(4-(pyridin-2-yl)piperidin-1-yl)- N-( m-tolyl)acetamide). Compounds were profiled using radioligand binding displacement assays, β-arrestin recruitment assays, cyclic AMP inhibition assays, and molecular dynamics computational modeling. We identified several novel D4R-selective ( Ki ≤ 4.3 nM and >100-fold vs other D2-like receptors) compounds with diverse partial agonist and antagonist profiles, falling into three structural groups. These compounds highlight receptor-ligand interactions that control efficacy at D2-like receptors and may provide insights into targeted drug discovery, leading to a better understanding of the role of D4Rs in neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4392164,20210302,4797946|6466372|10425450|16094666|45361874|109030343|109030515|155511803|155513053|155516494|155522719|155525431|155530763|155536720|155536815|155562395|155563301|155568411|155568867,103503876|103503918|440111698|440113589|440117695|440118212|440118777|440123600|440128439|440130571|440132532|440140737|440149835|440149986|440211928|440214136|440224758|440227125|440228263,1814,,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30883109,0,,P35462,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

On the basis of the same scaffold, we designed and synthesized a series of bitopic derivatives as dopamine D3R ligands. A number of these new compounds show a high binding affinity for D3R with excellent selectivity. Compound (1R,2R)-22e and its enantiomer (1S,2S)-22e show a comparable binding affinity for the D3R, but the former is a potent D3R agonist, while the latter acts as an antagonist. Molecular docking studies revealed different binding poses of the PCPMA moiety within the orthosteric binding pocket of the D3R, which might explain the different functional profiles of the enantiomers. Compound (1R,2R)-30q shows a high binding affinity for the D3R (Ki = 2.2 nM) along with good selectivity, as well as good bioavailability and brain penetration properties in mice.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent. Finding a specific agent that increase KCC2 function would potentially have therapeutic value, as increased KCC2 function reduces susceptibility to epileptic seizures.",23,Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening Facility,ED001_Antag_MDS,20090528,25067404,56405461,134|135|140|146|150|153|154|623|624|1128|1129|1131|1134|1136|1812|1813|1814|1815|1909|1910|2099|2550|2908|3269|3274|3350|3757|4543|4886|4887|4985|4986|4988|5734|6530|6531|6532|6869|10280|10800|14811|16177|24173|24208|24408|24410|25265|25399|29336|29412|29559|29709|81574|81812|83612|84109|257648|306255|101823647,,AAD14378|NP_000015|NP_000070|NP_000106|NP_000116|NP_000229|NP_000515|NP_000614|NP_000665|NP_000666|NP_000669|NP_000672|NP_000675|NP_000701|NP_000729|NP_000730|NP_000731|NP_000734|NP_000785|NP_000787|NP_000788|NP_000900|NP_000901|NP_000902|NP_000903|NP_000905|NP_000949|NP_001018087|NP_001034|NP_001035|NP_001036|NP_001049|NP_001091683|NP_001461|NP_001948|NP_005857|NP_005949|NP_006630|NP_032196|NP_032388|NP_036634|NP_036706|NP_036932|NP_037051|NP_057658|NP_058687|NP_058706|NP_058887|NP_058937|NP_071640|NP_110502|NP_112258|NP_112396|NP_113970|NP_671482|NP_899156|NP_937822|P49658|XP_001057307,NIH Initiatives,19279215,0,3.2.2.6,AAD14378|NP_037051|NP_058687|NP_671482|O35458|P02708|P03372|P04150|P04774|P07550|P08172|P08588|P08908|P08913|P11229|P13504|P14416|P15207|P18508|P20309|P21728|P21917|P22756|P23975|P24530|P25021|P25100|P25101|P25103|P25929|P29274|P30411|P30542|P31645|P32297|P35367|P35372|P35408|P35436|P35439|P35462|P41143|P41145|P43140|P46663|P48039|P49146|P49651|P49658|P63059|Q00960|Q01959|Q12809|Q96P65|Q99720|Q9R0C9|Q9UBS5|Q9Y271|XP_001057307,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1
652049,Summary,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Potentiators: Summary,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment._||_The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. This part of the project aims to discover novel potentiators._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: MH094203_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley, NINDS",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),D3Pot000,20130312,,,1814,,NP_387512,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P35462,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0
