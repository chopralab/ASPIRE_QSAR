None of these compounds showed detectable affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subtype of Glu receptors. Some of the compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H]kainic acid binding. The inhibitory effects on [3H]AMPA binding and agonist potencies at AMPA receptors of 7a-i were strictly dependent on the structure, electrostatic potential, and methyl substitution of the heterocyclic 5-substituent. Thus, while 7a (IC50 = 0.094 microM; EC50 = 2.3 microM) was approximately equipotent with AMPA (IC50 = 0.023 microM; EC50 = 5.4 microM), (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)isoxazol-4-yl]propio nic acid (7b) (IC50 = 48 microM; EC50 = 550 microM) was some 2 orders of magnitude weaker than AMPA, and (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-isoxazol-4 -yl] propionic acid (7c) (IC50 > 100 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive. Furthermore, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7i) (IC50 = 0.030 microM; EC50 = 0.92 microM) was more potent than AMPA, whereas its N-1 methyl isomer, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7h) (IC50 = 54 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive as an AMPA agonist. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed a positive correlation between receptor affinity, electrostatic potential near the nitrogen atom at the 'ortho' position of the heterocyclic 5-substituent, and the rotational energy barrier around the bond connecting the two rings. We envisage that a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group and an ortho-positioned heteroatom of the ring substituent at the 5-position stabilize receptor-active conformations of these AMPA analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751682,20181015,1221|3481675|10562939|10610792|10658567|10729534|10752476|10800053|10823814|10824747,103174429|103289365|103309919|103309920|103310042|103310043|103310045|103310166|103310208|103310209,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,In vitro,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9288165.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

143460,Literature-derived,Inhibition of [3H]L-glutamate binding to NMDA receptor of central nervous system,"Title: Phosphinic acid analogues of GABA. 2. Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys. The novel GABAB antagonists showed also protective effects in various animal models of absence epilepsy.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751720,20181014,130021,103335975,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650685.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The potencies of con-G[A7], con-G, and con-T as noncompetitive inhibitors of spermine-enhanced [3H]MK-801 binding to NMDA receptor obtained from human brain tissue are similar to those obtained using rat brain tissue. The secondary structure and activity of con-G are found to be highly sensitive to amino acid substitution and modification. NMR chemical shift data indicate that con-G, con-G[D8, D17], and con-G[A7] have similar conformations in the presence of Ca2+. This consists of a helix for residues 2-16, which is kinked in the vicinity of Gla10. This is confirmed by 3D structure calculations on con-G[A7]. Restraining this helix in a linear form (i.e., con-G[A7,E10-K13]) results in a minor reduction in potency. Incorporation of a 7-10 salt-bridge replacement (con-G[K7-E10]) prevents helix formation in aqueous solution and produces a peptide with low potency. Peptides with the Leu5-Tyr5 substitution also have low potencies (con-G[Y5,A7] and con-G[Y5,K7]) indicating that Leu5 in con-G is important for full antagonist behavior. We have also shown that the Gla-Ala7 substitution increases potency, whereas the Gla-Lys7 substitution has no effect. Con-G and con-G[K7] both exhibit selectivity between NMDA subtypes from mid-frontal and superior temporal gyri, but not between sensorimotor and mid-frontal gyri. Asn8 and/or Asn17 appear to be important for the ability of con-G to function as an inhibitor of polyamine-stimulated [3H]MK-801 binding, but not in maintaining secondary structure.

Since the three-dimensional (3D) structure of this ion channel is unknown, the structural requirements for uncompetitive inhibition were investigated by application of a three-step strategy: At first, Ki values were measured for a number of structurally diverse compounds at the phencyclidine (PCP) binding site in postmortem human frontal cortex. Second, a pharmacophore model was developed for this set of molecules employing a mathematical method called graph theory. The resulting pharmacophore provided a very good explanation for the ability of structurally diverse compounds to bind to the same binding site. Using the experimental data and the pharmacophore as a basis for the third step, a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) applying comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was performed. The QSAR proved to be highly consistent and showed good predictiveness for several additional molecules. The results give a deeper insight into the structural requirements for effective NMDA receptor antagonism and offer the opportunity for improved drug design. The study represents the first quantitative 3D-QSAR model for NMDA receptor blockade, and it comprises structurally very different molecules. That the alignment for a highly consistent CoMFA is based on an automated 3D pharmacophore analysis has important methodological implications.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL761030,20181016,2130|3821|4054|4601|4919|6468|19476|19478|35998|64245|64352|68778|86625|180081|3010129|5100144|5276622|5276624|5276625|5360696|5360697|10013264|10220703|10242135|15917395|44352415,103168867|103189283|103193630|103199488|103211988|103234890|103235190|103362353|103362427|103362736|103362807|103362985|103363016|103363150|103363159|103363160|103363300|103363320|103363345|103363366|103363380|103363398|103363421|103363453|123086250|123087813,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9464369.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists.

1456750,Literature-derived,Inhibition of NMDA receptor (unknown origin),"Title: Return of D4 Dopamine Receptor Antagonists in Drug Discovery._||_Abstract: The dopamine D4 receptor garnered a great deal of interest in the early 1990s when studies showed the atypical antipsychotic clozapine possessed higher affinity for D4, relative to other dopamine receptor subtypes, and that this activity might underlie the unique clinical efficacy of clozapine. Unfortunately, D4 antagonists that were developed for schizophrenia failed in the clinic. Thus, D4 fell out of favor as a therapeutic target, and work in this area was silent for decades. Recently, D4 ligands with improved selectivity for D4 against not only D1-3,5 but also other biogenic amine targets have emerged, and D4 is once again in the spotlight as a novel target for both addiction and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as other emerging diseases. This report will review the historical data for D4, review the known D4 ligands, and then highlight new data supporting a role for D4 inhibition in addiction, PD, and cancer.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4039185,20200621,188942,103318571,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28489950.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models.

Their protective activities against N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced cytotoxicity were investigated in vitro. All of the compounds exhibited neuroprotective activities, especially 12k, which showed higher potency than reference compound 1 (ifenprodil). Further investigation showed that 12k could attenuate Ca2+ influx and suppress the NR2B upregulation induced by NMDA. The docking results indicated that 12k could fit well into binding site of 1 in the NR2B-NMDA receptor. Additionally, 12k exhibited excellent metabolic stability. Furthermore, the results of behavioral tests showed that compound 12k could significantly improve learning and memory in vivo. These results suggested that 12k is a promising neuroprotective drug candidate and that the NR2B-NMDA receptor is a potential target of 12k.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4363725,20210302,11771731|155512008,103323195|440111995,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31494474.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,9606.0,19.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1
