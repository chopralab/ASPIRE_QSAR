68,156820,Confirmatory,In vitro inhibitory activity against [3H]-TCP binding to PCP receptor in guinea pig brain membrane homogenates,"Title: Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of N,N'-di-o-tolylguanidine analogues, high-affinity ligands for the haloperidol-sensitive sigma receptor._||_Abstract: With an eye toward the development of novel atypical antipsychotic agents, we have studied the structure-affinity relationships of N,N'-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG, 3) and its congeners at the haloperidol-sensitive sigma receptor. A number of DTG analogues were synthesized and evaluated in in vitro radioligand displacement experiments with guinea pig brain membrane homogenates, using the highly sigma-specific radioligands [3H]-3 and [3H]-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine and the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor specific compounds [3H]-N-[1-(2-thienyl)-cyclohexyl]piperidine and [3H]-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10- imine. The affinity of N,N'-diarylguanidines for the sigma receptor decreases with increasing steric bulk of ortho substituents larger than C2H5. Hydrophobic substituents are generally preferred over similarly positioned hydrophilic ones. Furthermore, electroneutral substituents are preferred over strongly electron donating or withdrawing groups. Significant binding to the sigma receptor is usually retained as long as at least one side of the guanidine bears a preferred group (e.g. 2-CH3C6H5). Replacement of one or both aryl rings with certain saturated carbocycles (e.g. cyclohexyl, norbornyl, or adamantyl) leads to a significant increase in affinity. By combining the best aromatic and best saturated carbocyclic substituents in the same molecule, we arrived at some of the most potent sigma ligands described to date (e.g. N-exo-2-norbornyl-N'-(2-iodophenyl)guanidine, IC50 = 3 nM vs [3H]-3). All of the compounds tested were several orders of magnitude more potent at the sigma receptor than at the PCP receptor, with a few notable exceptions.

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets.

This was done by correlating structural and physicochemical descriptors obtained from computation software with the experimentally observed [(3)H]MK-801 displacement ability of a small library of synthesized and in vitro screened arylidenaminoguanidines.

The quality of the ANN model (r(2)=0.828, rmsd=0.200, rCV(2)=0.721, loormsd=0.257) is similar to the PLS model, and indicates that the feature between the inputs and the output is majorly linear.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

Modest binding for two of the [3,4-d]s is observed at the allosteric fenobam mGluR5 site, but not sufficient to translate into a functional effect. The structure activity relationship (SAR) for mGluR2 and mGluR4 are distinct: the compounds which select for mGluR2 all contain fluorine on the N-6 aryl group. Furthermore, the [3,4-d]s in this study showed no significant binding at inhibitory GABAA, nor excitatory NMDA receptors, and previously we had disclosed that they lack significant activity at the System Xc-Antiporter.

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

In this article, we report on twelve novel polycyclic amine cage derivatives, synthesized with or without a propargylamine function, designed to possess inherent multifunctional neuroprotective activity. The MTT cytotoxicity assay results showed the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to be viable with the twelve compounds, particularly at concentrations less than 10 μM. The compounds also showed significant neuroprotective activity, ranging from 31% to 61% at 1 μM, when assayed on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells in which neurodegeneration was induced by MPP<sup>+</sup>. Calcium regulation assays conducted on the same cell line showed the compounds to be significant VGCC blockers with activity ranging from 26.6% to 51.3% at 10 μM; as well as significant NMDAr antagonists with compound 5 showing the best activity of 88.3% at 10 μM. When assayed on human MAO isoenzymes, most of the compounds showed significant inhibitory activity, with compound 5 showing the best activity (MAO-B: IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.70 μM). Generally, the compounds were about 3-52 times more selective to the MAO-B isoenzyme than the MAO-A isoenzyme.

As previously reported, 10 efficiently converted AF to sinus rhythm in a dog disease model.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4392966,20210302,155538033,440151791,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30879840.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
137,1602884,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to NMDA receptor (unknown origin),"Title: Ketamine esters and amides as short-acting anaesthetics: Structure-activity relationships for the side-chain._||_Abstract: N-Aliphatic ester analogues of the non-opioid ketamine (1) retain effective anaesthetic/analgesic properties while minimising ketamine's psychomimetic side-effects. We show that the anaesthetic/analgesic properties of these ester analogues depend critically on the length (from 2 to 4 carbons), polarity and steric cross-section of the aliphatic linker chain. More stable amide and ethylsulfone analogues generally showed weaker anaesthetic/analgesic activity. There was no correlation between the anaesthetic/analgesic properties of the compounds and their binding affinities for the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4401966,20210302,3821,103199488,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30792105.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 76 crystallographic hits were sorted into similar groups, with the 3-cyano-quinoline 1a (FP IC<sub>50</sub> = 220,000 nM, LE = 0.43) being a potent member of the 6,6-fused heterocyclic cluster. Employing SAR insights gained from structural comparisons of other H-PGDS fragment binding mode clusters, the initial hit 1a was converted into the 70-fold more potent quinoline 1d (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3,100 nM, LE = 0.49). A systematic substitution of the amine moiety of 1d, utilizing structural information and array chemistry, with modifications to improve inhibitor stability, resulted in the identification of the 300-fold more active H-PGDS inhibitor tool compound 1bv (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.9 nM, LE = 0.42). This selective inhibitor exhibited good murine pharmacokinetics, dose-dependently attenuated PGD<sub>2</sub> production in a mast cell degranulation assay and should be suitable to further explore H-PGDS biology.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4402274,20210302,129247606,440148932,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30858025.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
