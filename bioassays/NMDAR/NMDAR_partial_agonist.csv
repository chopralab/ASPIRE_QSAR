Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists.

Herein, we describe our research of the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in a series of (S)-spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,5'-oxazolidin]-2'-ones bearing various bicyclic moieties to discover novel alpha7 receptor agonists. Through a number of SAR studies on the series, we have found out that inhibition of CYP 2D6 isozyme, which was a primary obstacle for the previously identified compound, was avoidable by the introduction of bicyclic moieties. Chemical optimization of the series led to the identification of a novel and potent alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist 23. This compound not only possessed high binding affinity (K(i) = 3 nmol/L) toward the alpha7 receptor but also showed agonistic activity even at a concentration of 0.1 micromol/L.

Starting from 2-benzyl-imidazoline screening hits, a series of structurally related 2-benzyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazoles was investigated first, but it proved highly challenging to obtain compounds having sufficient selectivity against the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor. This issue could be successfully addressed by modification of the linker region and SAR exploration led to the discovery of highly selective isopropyl-substituted 4-aminomethyl-imidazole compounds. The work culminated in the identification of the selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5073012 (4-chlorophenyl)-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-isopropyl-amine, 24), which has a good pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration in rodents. RO5073012 has been found to be active in a behavioural rat model which is considered indicative for schizophrenia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2216407,20200625,24781869,163329089,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22795332.0,0,,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0
