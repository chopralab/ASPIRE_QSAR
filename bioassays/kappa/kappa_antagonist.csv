Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin.

Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL747233,20181017,443408|5480230|10349271|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734669|103734675|103735456,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P41145,9527.0,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series.

148746,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards Opioid receptor kappa 2,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

152408,Confirmatory,Opioid receptors antagonist activity in smooth-muscle tissue of guinea pig ileum (GPI),"Title: Design and synthesis of highly potent and selective cyclic dynorphin A analogues._||_Abstract: We have designed and synthesized several cyclic disulfide-containing peptide analogues of dynorphin A (Dyn A) which are conformationally constrained in the putative 'address' segment of the opioid ligand. Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor. The lack of correlation between the pharmacological profiles observed in smooth muscle and in the brain binding assays suggests the existence of different subtypes of the kappa and mu opioid receptors in the brain and peripheral nervous systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756021,20181012,10102939|10677974|15160017|16133805|25079852|25087514|25087515|25087516,103173862|103241413|103241617|103241618|103241619|103241662|103241663|103241664,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1972964,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844966,20200628,46877632,103734688,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Increasingly bulky enantiomeric N-alkyl homologs were prepared until their interaction with the sigma 1 receptor decreased and their insolubility became a hindrance to their evaluation in vivo and/or in vitro. The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors.

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL880986,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3.

On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed. In these compounds the octahydroquinolizine template of 4 was replaced by an octahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine scaffold. The new derivatives were tested for their binding affinities and in vitro functional activity against the cloned human mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point. Based on modeling, the spatial arrangement of the protonated nitrogen atom and the 9beta-OH substituent in (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 may facilitate the alignment of a putative water chain enabling proton transfer to a nearby proton acceptor group in the mu-opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL895005,20181022,16756731|16756734|16756735|16756840|16756841|16756953|16757050|16757147|22977851|44427433|44427434,103367952|103525467|103525468|103525469|103525470|103525471|103525472|103525473|103525474|103525475|163322951,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17625813,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

At present, there is little information available as to why this compound is selective for kappa opioid receptors. One approach to better understanding the mode of binding of 1 at kappa receptors is to systematically alter the structure of 1 and examine the effects on opioid receptor affinity and activity.

Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14-21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later. Protection by a rapidly cleared reagent indicates that norBNI did not persist at the site of action. In vitro binding of [(3)H]U69,593 to KOR showed that K(d) and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact. Consistent with the concept that the long-lasting effects might be caused by a functional disruption of KOR signaling, both norBNI and JDTic were found to stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing KOR-GFP but not in untransfected cells. Similarly, norBNI increased phospho-JNK in both the striatum and spinal cord in wild type mice but not in KOR knock-out mice. Pretreatment of mice with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 before norBNI attenuated the long acting antagonism. Together, these results suggest that the long duration KOR antagonists disrupt KOR signaling by activating JNK.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL977780,20181025,5480230,103698780,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17702750,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A variety of novel piperidine MDL 100907 derivatives, possible to label with (18)F-fluorine, were synthesized to improve molecular imaging properties of [(11)C]MDL 100907. Their in vitro affinities to a broad spectrum of neuroreceptors and their lipophilicities were determined and compared to the clinically used reference compounds MDL 100907 and altanserin. The novel compounds MA-1 (53) and (R)-MH.MZ (56) show K(i)-values in the nanomolar range towards the 5-HT(2A) receptor and insignificant binding to other 5-HT receptor subtypes or receptors. Interestingly, compounds MA-1 (53), MH.MZ (55) and (R)-MH.MZ (56) provide a receptor selectivity profile similar to MDL 100907. These compounds could possibly be preferable antagonistic (18)F-tracers for visualization of the 5-HT(2A) receptor status. Medium affine compounds (VK-1 (32), (51), (52), (54)) were synthesized and have K(i) values between 30 and 120 nM. All promising compounds show logP values between 2 and 3, that is, within the range of those for the established radiotracers altanserin and MDL 100907.

Surprisingly, all triazole analogs have shown negligible binding affinity at opioid receptors and the oxadiazole 4, a reported MOPR and KOPR antagonist, exhibits very low affinities to opioid receptors and no antagonism in our binding assays.

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR. Additionally, data also suggest that increasing the bulk around C(6) may allow control of subtype selectivity within these compound series.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1063597,20180911,44188273|45110000|45269407|45270231|45271055,103683498|103685209|103686977|103688766|103694091,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19364645,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

While the analgesic effects of these drugs are mediated by mu-opioid receptors (MOR), several studies have shown that antagonism or knockdown of delta-opioid receptors (DOR) can lessen or prevent development of tolerance and dependence. On the basis of computational modeling of putative active and inactive conformations of MOR and DOR, we have synthesized a series of pentapeptides with the goal of developing a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist peptide with similar affinity at both receptors as a tool to probe functional opioid receptor interaction(s).

These modifications were made mainly on the aryl side of the ester bond to permit possible rapid labeling of the carboxylic acid component with a positron emitter, either carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min), and included (i) replacement of the iodine atom with a small substituent such as nitrile, methyl, or fluoro, (ii) methylation of the 8-amino group, (iii) opening of the dioxan ring, and (iv) alteration of the length of the N-alkyl goup.

The secondary amine 10 represents the central building block for the synthesis of more than 25 tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-1-ols. Generally 7-hydroxy derivatives display higher NR2B receptor affinities than the corresponding 7-benzyloxy compounds. A distance of four atoms (five bond lengths) between the basic amino group and the terminal aryl moiety led to highest NR2B affinity. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (WMS-1410, 25) represents the most promising NR2B antagonist of this series showing a K(i)-value of 14nM. Compound 25 reveals excellent selectivity over more than 100 further relevant target proteins, antagonizes glutamate induced excitotoxicity (IC(50)=18.4nM) and is metabolically more stable than ifenprodil.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor.

A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity.

Herein, we describe the discovery and development of an antagonist NOP receptor occupancy (RO) tracer and a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand suitable to probe the NOP receptor in human clinical studies. A thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) around the high-affinity 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold identified a series of subnanomolar, highly selective NOP antagonists. Subsequently, these unlabeled NOP ligands were evaluated in vivo by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in rat to determine brain uptake, kinetics and specific binding. (S)-27 was identified as a suitable unlabeled preclinical RO tracer to accurately quantify NOP receptor engagement in rat brain.

In this series, the affinity and functional activity of the ligands were found to be influenced by the nature of the substituent at C-14 as well as by the substituent at N-17. Whereas the incorporation of a 3-phenylpropoxy group at C-14 on N-methylpyridomorhinan gave a dual MOR agonist/DOR agonist 17h, its incorporation on N-cyclopropylmethylpyridomorphinan gave a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist 17d. Interestingly, 17d, in contrast to 17h, did not produce tolerance or dependence effects upon prolonged treatment in cells expressing MOR and DOR. Moreover, 17d displayed greatly diminished analgesic tolerance as compared to morphine upon repeated administration, thus supporting the hypothesis that ligands with MOR agonist/DOR antagonist functional activity could emerge as novel analgesics devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2187201,20200625,71450134|71453774|71455505|71455506|71457288|71457289|71457290|71457291|71457292|71460942|71460943|71460944|71460945|71462655|71462656,163314660|163321597|163324966|163324967|163328404|163328405|163328406|163328407|163328408|163335413|163335414|163335415|163335416|163338799|163338800,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23016952,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents.

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285643,20200618,90678812|90678814,242640974|242640976,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens.

A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts.

The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest. An improved understanding of specific structural modifications that are likely to alter the functional activity of a GPCR ligand may be of use to researchers designing GPCR-targeted drugs and/or probe compounds, specifically in cases where a particular ligand exhibits good potency but not the preferred functional activity at the GPCR of choice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3777305,20180905,5284595|5288826,103169185|103575820,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26390077,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Building upon these considerations, we synthesized a new series of LP1 analogues by introducing naphthyl or heteroaromatic rings in propanamide side chain of its N-substituent (9-15). In vitro competition-binding assays in HEK293 cells stably expressing MOR, DOR or KOR showed that in compound 9 the 1-naphthyl ring led to the retention of MOR affinity (Ki(MOR)=38±4nM) displaying good selectivity versus DOR and KOR. In the electrically stimulated GPI, compound 9 was inactive as agonist but produced an antagonist potency value (pA2) of 8.6 in presence of MOR agonist DAMGO. Moreover, subcutaneously administered it antagonized the antinociceptive effects of morphine with an AD50=2.0mg/kg in mouse-tail flick test. Modeling studies on MOR revealed that compound 9 fit very well in the binding pocket but in a different way in respect to the agonist LP1. Probably the replacement of its N-substituent on the III, IV and V TM domains reflects an antagonist behavior. Therefore, compound 9 could represent a potential lead to further develop antagonists as valid therapeutic agents and useful pharmacological tools to study opioid receptor function.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3802783,20200624,123445395|127045653|127045654|127045655|127046953|127046954|127046955,336866137|336897541|336897542|336897543|336899364|336899365|336899366,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27234885,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine.

It is implicated in nociception, diuresis, emotion, cognition, and immune system functions. KOP agonists possess a strong analgesic effect accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria. On the other hand, antagonists of this receptor were found to block depression, anxiety, and drug-seeking behaviors in animal models. Recently, great interest has been given to the development of selective KOP antagonists as an addiction treatment that does not cause dependence itself or show high relapse rates like the currently used agents.

In spite of their stereochemistry, cis-N-2-phenylethyl N-normetazocine (phenazocine) enantiomers showed mixed opioid/σ1 receptor profiles and a significant in vivo analgesia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available regarding the evaluation of σ1 pharmacological profile in the antinociceptive effects of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine. Therefore, the present study was designed to ascertain this component by in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, we tested the σ1 affinity of both enantiomers by a predictive binding assay in absence or presence of phenytoin (DPH). Our results showed that DPH (1 mM) did not increase the σ1 receptor affinity of (+)-and (-)-phenazocine (Ki = 3.8 ± 0.4 nM, Ki = 85 ± 2.0 nM, respectively) suggesting a σ1 antagonist profile of both enantiomers. This σ1 antagonistic component of two phenazocine enantiomers was corroborated by in vivo studies in which the selective σ1 receptor agonist PRE-084, was able to unmask their σ1 antagonistic component associated with the opioid activity. The σ1 antagonistic component of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine may justify their analgesic activity and it suggests that they may constitute useful lead compounds to develop new ligands with this dual activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4000648,20200620,11314197,136933674,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27721146,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) has emerged as a promising target for both indications, raising demand for new chemotypes of KOR antagonists as well as G-protein-biased agonists.

Elevated plasma levels of the protein have been linked to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, adipocyte-specific overexpression of RBP4 was reported to cause hepatic steatosis in mice. We previously identified an orally bioavailable RBP4 antagonist that significantly lowered RBP4 serum levels in Abca4<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice with concomitant normalization of complement system protein expression and reduction of bisretinoid formation within the retinal pigment epithelium. We describe herein the discovery of novel RBP4 antagonists 48 and 59, which reduce serum RBP4 levels by >80% in mice upon acute oral dosing. Furthermore, 59 demonstrated efficacy in the transgenic adi-hRBP4 murine model of hepatic steatosis, suggesting that RBP4 antagonists may also have therapeutic utility for the treatment of NAFLD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4305300,20210302,118872292,440138775,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31079449,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873919,20181016,56657871,134434230,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,,P41145,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey.

The affinities of the target compounds for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were determined by radiolabeled binding experiments using bovine brain membranes. An analogous series of 7,8-dihydrocodeinones and morphinones was prepared and assayed in the same systems. The 3-methoxy derivatives 3 and 4 were more selective than the corresponding morphinones for the mu receptor. The 5 beta-methylcodeinones 25 and 27 had lower affinity at all receptors than the corresponding morphinones, but the 5 beta-methylmorphinones had affinities similar to the morphinones 5 and 6. A similar pattern was observed in the 7,8-dihydro series. Two compounds, 5 beta-methyl-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydromorphinone, 20 (MET-CAMO), and N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydronormorphinone, 22 (N-CPM-MET- CAMO), acted as nonequilibrium ligands in antinociception and membrane binding studies. In mice after icv administration, neither ligand showed any agonist activity but 8-24 h after administration both compounds acted as potent mu antagonists. A Scatchard plot of the effect of N-CPM-MET-CAMO on [3H]DAMGO ([3H]D-Ala2, (Me)-Phe4, Gly(ol)5] enkephalin) binding to bovine striatal membranes showed that there was a significant decrease in the Bmax value and a marginal effect on the Kd value suggesting that the number of binding sites was reduced. When taken together, these results support the view that 20 and 22 bind covalently to the mu receptor.

148747,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards opioid receptor kappa 2,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 1234-1237), the most potent antinociceptive compounds preferred a particular orientation of the phenyl ring.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750588,20181013,5288826|12368881|44284742|44285029|44285070|44299404,103169185|103213590|103213625|103214145|103214210|103243877,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1315868,0,,P41145,9913.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions.

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding. However, a relationship involving the hydrophobic character of the N-substituent is discussed. The N-(2-fluoroethyl) derivatives in both series were found to cause convulsions in rats at doses of 40-45 mg/kg ip.

On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844967,20200628,5486827|5497186|14423337|46877644,103316718|103697951|103734676|103734704,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Recently discovered kappa-antagonists have not yet been utilised in vivo. We here report the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of a new amidine derivative of naltrindole. It showed substantially greater kappa-selectivity in binding assays than known analogues with shorter spacer in the amidine side chain.

The methyloctahydroisoquinolines 6a-g can exist in conformations where the 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent is either axial or equatorial, similar to the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines 4. The 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is responsible for the antagonist activity observed in the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine antagonists. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 6a shows that the 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is favored in the solid state. Molecular modeling studies also suggest that the equatorial conformation has lower potential energy relative to that of the axial conformation. Evaluation of 6a-g in the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S in vitro functional assay showed that they were opioid receptor pure antagonists.

Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of [O-methyl-(11)C]2-{4-[4-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (10), a potential high affinity (K(i) = 1.36 nM) 5-HT(1A) agonist PET tracer is described. Piperazine 10 is a 5-HT(1A) agonist with an EC(50) comparable to serotonin, based on cAMP formation and GTP(gamma)S binding assays. Radiosynthesis of [(11)C]10 has been achieved by reacting 2-{4-[4-(7-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (9) and [(11)C]CH(3)OTf in 25 +/- 5% (n = 15) yield at the end of synthesis (EOS). The chemical and radiochemical purities of [(11)C]10 were >99% with a specific activity 1500 +/- 300 Ci/mmol (n =15). PET studies in anesthetized baboon demonstrate [(11)C]10 specific binding in brain regions rich in 5-HT(1A) receptors. Binding of [(11)C]10 was blocked by WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT. The regional brain volumes of distribution (V(T)) of [(11)C]10 in baboon correlate with [(11)C]WAY100635 V(T) in baboons.

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3. One of the active constrained analogues, compound 4, exhibited subnanomolar mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.62 nM) and potent mu-opioid antagonist activity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM). On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399075,20200629,5360515|68867300|71680922|71680923|71680924|71681076|71681077|71681078|71681079,131283791|174491695|174491696|174496752|174507179|174512307|174517359|174517360|174522568,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Y2 receptor is the most abundant Y subtype receptor in the central nervous system and implicated with food intake, bone formation, affective disorders, alcohol and drugs of abuse, epilepsy, pain, and cancer. The lack of small molecule non-peptidic Y2 receptor modulators suitable as in vivo pharmacological tools hampered the progress to uncover the precise pharmacological role of Y2.

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts.

However, there is substantial interest in its activities at the kappa opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptors. This has led to an interest in developing compounds with a buprenorphine-like pharmacological profile but with lower efficacy at mu opioid receptors.

Building upon these considerations, we synthesized a new series of LP1 analogues by introducing naphthyl or heteroaromatic rings in propanamide side chain of its N-substituent (9-15). In vitro competition-binding assays in HEK293 cells stably expressing MOR, DOR or KOR showed that in compound 9 the 1-naphthyl ring led to the retention of MOR affinity (Ki(MOR)=38±4nM) displaying good selectivity versus DOR and KOR. In the electrically stimulated GPI, compound 9 was inactive as agonist but produced an antagonist potency value (pA2) of 8.6 in presence of MOR agonist DAMGO. Moreover, subcutaneously administered it antagonized the antinociceptive effects of morphine with an AD50=2.0mg/kg in mouse-tail flick test. Modeling studies on MOR revealed that compound 9 fit very well in the binding pocket but in a different way in respect to the agonist LP1.

Pharmacological intervention has focused on molecules that decrease NRF2-ubiquitination through covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues, but such electrophilic compounds lack selectivity and may be associated with off-target toxicity. We report here the first use of a fragment-based approach to directly target the KEAP1 Kelch-NRF2 interaction. X-ray crystallographic screening identified three distinct 'hot-spots' for fragment binding within the NRF2 binding pocket of KEAP1, allowing progression of a weak fragment hit to molecules with nanomolar affinity for KEAP1 while maintaining drug-like properties.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed. Compounds with a phenolic 4-hydroxy group do not form the hydrogen bond with His291, an important residue for KOP affinity and agonist activity. The size of the N-substituent hosted by the hydrophobic pocket formed by Val108, Ile316 and Tyr320 considerably influences binding and selectivity, with the n-alkyl size limit being five carbon atoms, while bulky substituents turn KOP agonists in antagonists. Thus, combination of experimental and molecular modeling strategies provides an initial framework for understanding the structural features of diphenethylamines that are essential to promote binding affinity and selectivity for the KOP receptor, and may be involved in transduction of the ligand binding event into molecular changes, ultimately leading to receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3858678,20200624,122589952|134139387|134147031,374283991|374295165|374322756,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27567368,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Based on the structural modification of LY2456302, a series of aminobenzyloxyarylamide derivatives were designed and synthesized as κ opioid receptor antagonists. The κ opioid receptor binding ability of these compounds were evaluated with opioid receptors binding assays. Compounds 1a-d showed high affinity for κ opioid receptor. Especially for compound 1c, exhibited a significant Ki value of 15.7 nM for κ opioid receptor binding and a higher selectivity over μ and δ opioid receptors compared to (±)LY2456302. In addition, compound 1c also showed potent κ antagonist activity with κ IC50 = 9.32 nM in [35S]GTP-γ-S functional assay.

Elevated plasma levels of the protein have been linked to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, adipocyte-specific overexpression of RBP4 was reported to cause hepatic steatosis in mice. We previously identified an orally bioavailable RBP4 antagonist that significantly lowered RBP4 serum levels in Abca4<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice with concomitant normalization of complement system protein expression and reduction of bisretinoid formation within the retinal pigment epithelium. We describe herein the discovery of novel RBP4 antagonists 48 and 59, which reduce serum RBP4 levels by >80% in mice upon acute oral dosing. Furthermore, 59 demonstrated efficacy in the transgenic adi-hRBP4 murine model of hepatic steatosis, suggesting that RBP4 antagonists may also have therapeutic utility for the treatment of NAFLD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4305299,20210302,118483320|118872292,374314022|440138775,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31079449,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies.

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM). Most of the synthesized ligands reveal either similar GluN2B and σ<sub>1</sub> affinity or higher σ<sub>1</sub> affinity than GluN2B affinity.

In this paper, we describe the discovery of 1-(6-ethyl-8-fluoro-4-methyl-3-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)quinolin-2-yl)- N-(tetrahydro-2 H-pyran-4-yl)piperidin-4 amine (CYM-53093, BTRX-335140) as a potent and selective KOR antagonist, endowed with favorable in vitro ADMET and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles and medication-like duration of action in rat pharmacodynamic experiments. Orally administered CYM-53093 showed robust efficacy in antagonizing KOR agonist-induced prolactin secretion and in tail-flick analgesia in mice. CYM-53093 exhibited a broad selectivity over a panel of off-target proteins.

However, selective MOR agonists including fentanyl and morphine derivatives are limited clinically due to high risks of dependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression. We recently reported the development of a long-acting, bifunctional MOR agonist/δ-opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist analgesic devoid of tolerance or dependence in mice (AAH8, henceforth referred to as 2B). To address the need for short-acting treatments for breakthrough pain, we present a series of novel, short-acting, high-potency MOR agonist/DOR antagonist ligands with antinociceptive activity in vivo. In this study, we utilized a two-dimensional structure-activity relationship matrix to identify pharmacological trends attributable to combinations of two key pharmacophore elements within the chemotype.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent.
