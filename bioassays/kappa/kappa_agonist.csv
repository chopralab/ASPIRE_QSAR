Selected structural modifications are made to the basic moiety and at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-positions on the piperidine nucleus to enable structure-activity relationships to be delineated. As a result, some highly potent and selective kappa-receptor agonists have been identified. In particular, this has been achieved by introduction of oxygen-containing functionality into the 4-position of the piperidine nucleus or the 3-position of the pyrrolidinylmethyl side chain. Thus, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]- 2-[[1-(3-oxopyrrolidinyl)]methyl]piperidine (10) possesses high activity in the rabbit vas deferens (LVD, kappa-specific tissue) (IC50 = 0.20 nM) and is a potent antinociceptive agent, as determined by the mouse acetylcholine-induced abdominal constriction test (MAC) (ED50 = 0.06 mg/kg, sc).

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Andrews analysis of the NIH nonpeptide lead SNC-80 suggested the removal of substituents not predicted to contribute to binding. This approach led to a simplified lead, N, N-diethyl-4-[phenyl(1-piperazinyl)methyl]benzamide (1), which retained potent binding affinity and selectivity to the human delta receptor (IC(50) = 11 nM, mu/delta = 740, kappa/delta > 900) and potency as a full agonist (EC(50) = 36 nM) but had a markedly reduced molecular weight, only one chiral center, and increased in vitro metabolic stability. From this lead, the key pharmacophore groups for delta receptor affinity and activation were more clearly defined by SAR and mutagenesis studies. Further structural modifications on the basis of 1 confirmed the importance of the N, N-diethylbenzamide group and the piperazine lower basic nitrogen for delta binding, in agreement with mutagenesis data. A number of piperazine N-alkyl substituents were tolerated. In contrast, modifications of the phenyl group led to the discovery of a series of diarylmethylpiperazines exemplified by N, N-diethyl-4-[1-piperazinyl(8-quinolinyl)methyl]benzamide (56) which had an improved in vitro binding profile (IC(50) = 0.5 nM, mu/delta = 1239, EC(50) = 3.6 nM) and increased in vitro metabolic stability compared to SNC-80.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751988,20181016,119029|123924|9801260|10501573|10525105|10525171|10546813|10569964|10598391|10598392|10618862|10620493|10642101|10644815|10644995|10690216|10713071|10739828|10760345|10762996|10786358|11742939|11793476|11794240|11794241,103175041|103193996|103195093|103357906|103357926|103357928|103358388|103358395|103358650|103358759|103358761|103358787|103358800|103358801|103358819|103358978|103358980|103358981|103358983|103359077|103359106|103359152|103359153|103359187|163319402,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11052793,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755694,20181017,105104|5288826|5497186|10408752|10430432|10527816|10574908|10599027|10645976|10718445|10883143|10926896|10938869|11036499|11090735|11784022|11795327|11811844|15548354|15548355|44349947|71456174|73346599|73349647|73352661,103169185|103177815|103357118|103357517|103357547|103357602|103357703|103357704|103357773|103357774|103357801|103357903|103357904|103357911|103358210|103358275|103358320|103358363|103697951|163322761|163326190|163326191|174489426|174499610|174509985,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component.

However in this series of 14beta-cinnamoylamino derivatives the codeinones (e.g. methoclocinnamox, MC-CAM) had unexpectedly high mu-opioid receptor affinity, similar to that of the morphinone (clocinnamox, C-CAM). The current report relates to the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of deoxyclocinnamox (DOC-CAM) which acted as a high-affinity opioid antagonist similar to C-CAM but with greater mu selectivity. Thus it appears that the C(3)-substituent does not play a major role in the binding of the 14beta-cinnamoyl series and that the cinnamoyl group itself may in fact be the dominant binding feature.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750072,20181016,46877660,103734733,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10966754,0,,P41145,9527.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL747233,20181017,443408|5480230|10349271|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734669|103734675|103735456,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P41145,9527.0,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872672,20181017,10349271,103734669,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P41145,9527.0,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

Using a combination of in vitro and in vivo test systems, the receptor profiles of selected compounds have been assessed and in some instances distinguish between mu- and kappa-receptor agonists. In general, introduction of a 6-exocyclic methylene group into the trans-3-(decahydro-4a-isoquinolinyl)phenol system enhanced both antinociceptive activity and kappa-opioid receptor selectivity. For each series, analogues bearing an N-cyclopropylmethyl substituent exhibited greater kappa-receptor selectivity while N-methyl derivatives showed greater mu-receptor selectivity. The 7-substituted compounds (3b) were significantly less potent antinociceptive agents than their 6-substituted counterparts (3a), the octahydroisoquinoline analogues exhibiting intermediate activity. The axial 8-methyl-6-exocyclic methylene isoquinoline (20) is the most potent compound in the mouse abdominal constriction assay (ED50 = 0.05 mg/kg sc), whereas the equatorial 8-methyl isomer (16) was significantly less potent (ED50 = 3.3 mg/kg sc).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754077,20181013,167448|5288826|5462471|44273397|44367821|44367907|44367923|44367999|44368165|44368438|44368439,103169185|103186171|103217856|103399248|103399279|103399463|103399478|103399592|103399855|103400288|103400289,4985|4986|4988,In vitro,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1310115,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244. The cis fused, 4,5 dimethyl ether substituted cyclohexane analogue trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzo[b]thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (32) has high in vitro kappa opioid receptor affinity (Ki = 16 nM) and equipotent analgesic activity to morphine after iv administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752206,20181012,5288826|18607196|45260001|45260003|45260008|45260021|45260030|45260040|45264213,103169185|103670678|103670680|103670684|103670690|103670709|103670729|103670742|103676932,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2567782,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Modified tetrahydroisoquinoline (Tiq) residues were reacted with different electrophiles in order to create novel molecules that would mimic the original dipeptide. A specific class of thioureas bearing basic pyrrolidine residues were shown to give good binding affinities. Further alkylation of the pyrrolidine ring with benzyl derivatives also proved to increase the mu binding affinity. In addition, it was demonstrated that mu binding was enhanced by the presence of polar groups around the benzyl ring having hydrogen-bonding character (donor/acceptor).

Systematic exploration of the conformational space of the ligand combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water revealed consistent conformational preferences for all the kappa-agonists in this series. The results were further compared with available X-ray and 1D- and 2D-NMR data to identify potential 'lead' conformers for molecular docking. Ligand binding modes were initially determined using automated docking of two of the ligands (U50,488 and BRL52,537) to the kappa-opioid receptor. Extrapolation of the predicted binding mode to other members in this ligand series revealed similar docking preferences, with each ligand docked along the receptor helical axis.

Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists.

The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

The most striking finding was the very large difference in kappa-opioid receptor activity between the diastereomeric ethyl ethers: 46-fold in binding, 150-fold in GPI, and 900-fold in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay in favor of the (R)-diastereomer. Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2.

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding.

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding.

Rearrangement of 3 (NaOMe) afforded 5,14-exo-(phenyloxyamino)thebainone and derivatives (4a-d); reduction of 3 led to 14-(phenylamino)dihydrocodeinone and derivatives (5a-d). Thebaine also reacted with 1-halo-1-nitrosocyclohexane (halo = Cl, Br) and with benzohydroxamic acid under oxidizing conditions to give 14-(hydroxyamino)codeinone (6). All compounds, 3-6, were evaluated as analgetics and antagonists by the tail-flick, writhing, and Straub tail assays: compounds of types 3-5 were analgetics (N-Me), one-third to one-tenth as potent as morphine, or antagonists [N-(cyclopropylmethyl)], 50 to 100 times less potent than naloxone; 6 behaved as an antagonist in the tail-flick test but as an agonist in the other assays.

When incubated with mouse or monkey liver S9 microsomes, (R)-3 is metabolized by N-demethylation and oxidation to (R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(methylamino)-4H-imidazo[4,5,1-ij]quinolin-2(1H) -one [(R)-6], intermediate metabolites, where N-demethylation to the imidazoquinoline (R)-4 and where oxidation to the imidazoquinolinone (R)-5 has taken place, are also observed in these incubates. A cross-species study on the metabolism of (R)-3 in vitro has shown large variations in the extent of metabolism from species to species. Imidazoquinolinones (R)-5 and (R)-6 have comparable activity to (R)-3 in animals and also show good dopaminergic (D2) and serotonergic (5HT1A) activities in binding assays.

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems.

On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

These ligands were of interest in our investigation of the relationship between the structure of the ester function and the ability to irreversibly block mu opioid receptors. While all of the ligands were potent reversible agonists in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, most appeared to behave as irreversible antagonists of morphine. The benzyl 5 and phenethyl 6 esters possessed irreversible mu antagonist potency that was of similar magnitude to that of beta-FNA in the GPI. In the MVD, all esters appeared to irreversibly block the agonist effect of morphine, but none of the compounds irreversibly antagonized [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin to a significant degree. [3H]Dihydromorphine displacement studies revealed no relationship between the affinity of the esters 1-6 and the irreversible blockage of mu receptors in the GPI or MVD.

227050,Literature-derived,Competitive inhibition of Ethylketazocine on Guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle for the opioid receptor kappa at 20 nM,"Title: Role of spacer and address components in peptidomimetic delta opioid receptor antagonists related to naltrindole._||_Abstract: A series of heterocyclic analogues 2-5 related to naltrindole (1) (NTI) and 6-arylnaltrexone derivatives 6-8 were synthesized in order to determine the role of the spacer and the address moieties in conferring delta opioid receptor antagonist activity. The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844966,20200628,46877632,103734688,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849962,20200704,5360515|44297100,103238133|131283791,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Increasingly bulky enantiomeric N-alkyl homologs were prepared until their interaction with the sigma 1 receptor decreased and their insolubility became a hindrance to their evaluation in vivo and/or in vitro. The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors. However, bulkier homologs (hexyl through decyl) displayed higher enantioselectivity at kappa or delta receptors than at the mu (monkey) receptor.

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL880986,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect.

To investigate the importance of the 14-substituent, a series of analogues in which the side chain length is varied and the amide and alkene functions are reduced have been prepared. Binding affinity, particularly at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), was largely determined by the aromatic group of the side chain. In the [35S]GTPgammaS functional assay, the ligands having a three-carbon side chain were more potent antagonists than their longer chain counterparts, while shorter, two-carbon chain analogues were of higher MOR efficacy, an effect that was confirmed in vivo.

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3. One of the active constrained analogues, compound 4, exhibited subnanomolar mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.62 nM) and potent mu-opioid antagonist activity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM). On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed. In these compounds the octahydroquinolizine template of 4 was replaced by an octahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine scaffold. The new derivatives were tested for their binding affinities and in vitro functional activity against the cloned human mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. From this study, we identified compound 36, which displays high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.47 nM), potent mu in vitro antagonist activity (IC(50) = 1.8 nM) and improved binding selectivity profile mu/kappa and mu/delta, when compared to 4.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909855,20181021,16094362|16094376|16094382|16094385|16094396|16094409|16094412|16094422|16094423|16094427|16094429|16094431,103503646|103503651|103503652|103503661|103503663|103503669|103503676|103503677|103503702|103503703|103503710|103503717,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149859,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Three of the 10 compounds, (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-9-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl-2-phenylethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10), (1R,5S)-(+)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methylene-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S)-(+)-14), and (1R,5S,9R)-(-)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methyl-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S,9R)-(+)-15) had subnanomolar affinity at mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.19, 0.19, and 0.63 nM, respectively). The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point. Based on modeling, the spatial arrangement of the protonated nitrogen atom and the 9beta-OH substituent in (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 may facilitate the alignment of a putative water chain enabling proton transfer to a nearby proton acceptor group in the mu-opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL895005,20181022,16756731|16756734|16756735|16756840|16756841|16756953|16757050|16757147|22977851|44427433|44427434,103367952|103525467|103525468|103525469|103525470|103525471|103525472|103525473|103525474|103525475|163322951,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17625813,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

On the basis of its high delta selectivity, H-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH (reference compound 1) is a useful starting point for the synthesis of (18)F-labeled compounds prepared by the coupling of N-succinimidyl 4-[ (18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) with Boc-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH under slightly basic conditions at 37 degrees C for 15 min, deprotection with TFA, and HPLC purification. The total synthesis time was 120 min, and the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [(18)F]- 1 was about 25-30% ( n = 5) starting from [(18)F]SFB ( n = 5) with an effective specific activity about 46 GBq/micromol. In vitro autoradiography studies showed prominent uptake of [ (18)F]- 1 in the striatum and cortex with significant blocking by 1 and UFP-501 (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), suggesting high specific binding of [(18)F]- 1 to delta-opioid receptors. Noninvasive microPET imaging studies revealed the absence of [(18)F]- 1 in rat brain, since it fails to cross the blood-brain barrier.

The activity of salvinorin A is unusual compared to other opioids such as morphine in that it mediates potent kappa opioid receptor signaling yet leads to less receptor downregulation than observed with other kappa agonists. Our initial chemical modifications of salvinorin A have yielded one analogue, herkinorin ( 1c), with high affinity at the microOR. We recently reported that 1c does not promote the recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the microOR or receptor internalization. Here we describe three new derivatives of 1c ( 3c, 3f, and 3i) with similar properties and one, benzamide 7b, that promotes recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the microOR and receptor internalization. When the important role micro opioid receptor regulation plays in determining physiological responsiveness to opioid narcotics is considered, micro opioids derived from salvinorin A may offer a unique template for the development of functionally selective mu opioid receptor-ligands with the ability to produce analgesia while limiting adverse side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL935623,20181023,128563|3036289|5462471|11431898|11561040|11562400|16059781|24829369|24854100|24854177|24854180|24854260|44450499,103217856|103457931|103458205|103498192|103566762|103566802|103566841|103566845|103566928|103567011|103567013|103567054|123099351,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18380425,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970718,20181026,5497186|15307413|24949529|24949532|24949683|24949684|24949687|24949689,103586336|103587313|103622354|103622355|103622440|103623454|103623455|103697951,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14-21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later. Protection by a rapidly cleared reagent indicates that norBNI did not persist at the site of action. In vitro binding of [(3)H]U69,593 to KOR showed that K(d) and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact. Consistent with the concept that the long-lasting effects might be caused by a functional disruption of KOR signaling, both norBNI and JDTic were found to stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing KOR-GFP but not in untransfected cells. Similarly, norBNI increased phospho-JNK in both the striatum and spinal cord in wild type mice but not in KOR knock-out mice. Pretreatment of mice with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 before norBNI attenuated the long acting antagonism. Together, these results suggest that the long duration KOR antagonists disrupt KOR signaling by activating JNK.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL977780,20181025,5480230,103698780,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17702750,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The discoveries of BW373U86 (1) and SNC80 (2) contributed to the rapid expansion of research in this field. However, poor drug-like properties and low therapeutic indices have prevented clinical evaluation of these agents. Doses of 1 and 2 similar to those required for analgesic activity produce convulsions in rodents and nonhuman primates. Recently, we described a novel series of potent, selective, and orally bioavailable delta opioid receptor agonists. The lead derivative, ADL5859 (4), is currently in phase II proof-of-concept studies for the management of pain. Further structure activity relationship exploration has led to the discovery of ADL5747 (36), which is approximately 50-fold more potent than 4 in an animal model of inflammatory pain. On the basis of its favorable efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile, 36 was selected as a clinical candidate for the treatment of pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1056547,20180911,11382472|44254063|44254503|44254859|44254956,103681770|103686941|103686942|103686945|103688739,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19694468,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR. Additionally, data also suggest that increasing the bulk around C(6) may allow control of subtype selectivity within these compound series.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1063597,20180911,44188273|45110000|45269407|45270231|45271055,103683498|103685209|103686977|103688766|103694091,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19364645,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

To further examine the role of this electrostatic interaction in receptor binding and activation, we synthesized 'carba'-analogues of a published fentanyl analogue containing a 3-(guanidinomethyl)-benzyl group in place of the phenyl moiety attached to the ethylamido group (C. Dardonville et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 6570-6580 (1)), in which the piperidine ring nitrogen was replaced with a carbon. As expected, the resulting cis and trans isomers (8a and 8b) showed reduced mu and kappa opioid receptor binding affinities as compared to 1 but, surprisingly, retained opioid full agonist activity with about half the potency of leucine-enkephalin in the guinea pig ileum assay. In conjunction with performed receptor docking studies, these results indicate that the electrostatic interaction of the protonated nitrogen in the piperidine ring of fentanyl analogues with the Asp residue in the third TMH is not a conditio sine qua non for opioid receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1112645,20180913,22810742,103747005,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20218625,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor [or opioid-receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor] are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the immune systems, and peripheral organs, and have a crucial role in the pain sensory system. Indeed, peripheral or intrathecal N/OFQ has displayed antinociceptive activities in neuropathic pain models, and inhibitory effects on pain-related neurotransmitter releases and on synaptic transmissions of C- and Aδ-fibers. In this study, design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of peripheral/spinal cord-targeting non-peptide NOP receptor agonist were investigated for the treatment of neuropathic pain, which resulted in the discovery of highly selective and potent novel NOP receptor full agonist {1-[4-(2-{hexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl}-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]cyclooctyl}methanol 1 (HPCOM) as systemically (subcutaneously) potent new-class analgesic. Thus, 1 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibitory effect against mechanical allodynia in chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain model rats, robust metabolic stability and little hERG potassium ion channel binding affinity, with its unique and potentially safe profiles and mechanisms, which were distinctive from those of N/OFQ in terms of site-differential effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1659148,20200626,16131448|49843555|53316968|53316969|53319615|53319616|53319617|53322245|53322246|53324890|53325608|53326167,103532611|124956810|124956811|124962100|124962101|124962102|124967393|124967394|124972650|124972651|124973921|124975252,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20875743,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Binding studies revealed that all new 14-phenylpropoxymorphinans (11-18) displayed high affinity to opioid receptors. Replacement of the 14-methoxy group with a phenylpropoxy group led to an enhancement in affinity to all three opioid receptor types, with most pronounced increases in δ and κ activities, hence resulting in a loss of μ receptor selectivity.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1763213,20200629,5311340|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|131271836|131271837|131271839|131271840|131271841|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277788|131277789|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281858|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131287148,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Reductive amination of the bicyclic ketone 11 with pyrrolidine and NaBH(OAc)3 provided the pyrrolidine 12 with excellent diastereoselectivity (>99:1). The diastereomeric pyrrolidine 24 was established by a stepwise strategy, involving an unselective nucleophilic substitution of the triflate 20 with NaN3 as key step. The synthesis of 9 and 10 was completed by LiAlH4 reduction, replacement of the PMB group at N-9 with a (3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl residue and the N-7-benzyl group with the methoxycarbonyl moiety. The κ receptor affinity of the new compounds is strongly dependent on the stereochemistry and the N-7-substituent.

Synthesis of an N-substituted 4-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan with high affinity and selective μ-antagonist activity._||_Abstract: A simple three-step synthesis of 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-ol (3a) was achieved using an osmium tetroxide mediated oxidation of the known intermediate 6. A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity. The modest change in spatial position of the hydroxyl moiety, and not the N-substituent, induced the change from potent agonist to an antagonist of moderate potency.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1955137,20200626,105104|5288826|57391716|57393448|57395174|57396943|57396944|57402172,103169185|103177815|136923502|136926723|136929908|136933179|136933180|136942933,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22341895,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Herein, we describe the discovery and development of an antagonist NOP receptor occupancy (RO) tracer and a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand suitable to probe the NOP receptor in human clinical studies. A thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) around the high-affinity 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold identified a series of subnanomolar, highly selective NOP antagonists. Subsequently, these unlabeled NOP ligands were evaluated in vivo by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in rat to determine brain uptake, kinetics and specific binding. (S)-27 was identified as a suitable unlabeled preclinical RO tracer to accurately quantify NOP receptor engagement in rat brain. Three compounds were selected for evaluation in nonhuman primates as PET tracers: (-)-26, (-)-30, and (-)-33. Carbon-11 labeling of (+)-31 yielded [(11)C]-(S)-30, which exhibited minimal generation of central nervous system (CNS) penetrant radiometabolites, improved brain uptake, and was an excellent PET radioligand in both rat and monkey. Currently [(11)C]-(S)-30 is being evaluated as a PET radiotracer for the NOP receptor in human subjects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2089822,20180922,5311194|9803475|9844019|10047612|11315651|11464846|60154189|60154191|60154192|60154193|70691174|70695374|70697391|70697392,103392033|103683969|160670439|160675774|160675775|160681105|160681106|160691905|160702702|160702703|160707940|160707941|160707944|160707945,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22541041,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In the course of this study, we focused on the effect of the substituent at 17-N in nalfurafine on the binding affinity for the κ receptor. The exchange of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups, which are strong electron withdrawing substituents, almost completely diminished the binding affinities for the μ and δ opioid receptors, but the binding affinity for the κ receptor was still maintained. As a result, nalfurafine derivatives with 17-fluoro-substituted alkyl groups showed higher selectivities for the κ receptor than did nalfurafine itself. With regard to the κ agonistic activities, the conversion of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups led to the gradual decrease of the agonistic activities in the order corresponding to their binding affinities for the κ receptor. In contrast, the derivative with the bulky 17-isobutyl group showed lower affinity and agonistic activity for the κ receptor than the derivatives with the smaller functional groups. This research suggested that both the electronic property and the steric characteristics of the 17-N substituent would have a great influence on the binding property for the κ receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2318807,20200625,105104|6918287|71716140|71717967|71717969|71718579|71718581|71719794|71720405,103177815|103646514|164128185|164136686|164136687|164139519|164139520|164145085|164147884,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23200250,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents. This Perspective provides a description of preclinical research conducted in the development of several different classes of selective KOR antagonists, a summary of the clinical studies conducted thus far, and recommendations for the type of work needed in the future to determine if these agents would be useful as pharmacotherapies for neuropsychiatric illness.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2327849,20200626,73348688,174495300,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23360448,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We have recently described modifications to these peptides that confer a μ opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, δ opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist profile, which has been shown to reduce the development of tolerance to the analgesic actions of MOR agonists. Several such bifunctional ligands have been reported, but none has been demonstrated to cross the blood-brain barrier. Here we describe the transfer of structural features that evoked MOR agonist/DOR antagonist behavior in the cyclic peptides to the tetrahydroquinoline scaffold and show that the resulting peptidomimetics maintain the desired pharmacological profile.

In this study, it is shown that a predictive model for efficacy at KOR can be derived, with efficacy being controlled by the length of the group attached to C20 and by the introduction of branching into the side chain.

We report here our forays into the structure-activity relationships for discovering 'bifunctional' NOP-mu opioid receptor (MOP) ligands, starting from our NOP-selective scaffolds.

However, the reason for this increase remains unclear. Here we report our efforts towards the synthesis and evaluation of C-2 constrained analogs of salvinorin A. These analogs were evaluated at opioid receptors in radioligand binding experiments as well as in the GTP-γ-S functional assay. One compound, 5, was found to have affinity and potency at κ opioid (KOP) receptors comparable to salvinorin A. In further studies, 5 was found to attenuate cocaine-induced drug seeking behavior in rats comparably to salvinorin A.

1147848,Literature-derived,Displacement of [3H]naloxone from opioid receptor (unknown origin) relative to morphine,"Title: Intramolecular hydrogen bonding and conformational studies of bridged thebaine and oripavine opiate narcotic agonists and antagonists._||_Abstract: A conformational study of a series of oripavine derivatives is reported using the PCILO semiempirical quantum mechanical method. Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285643,20200618,90678812|90678814,242640974|242640976,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Compound optimization led to the identification of potent mGlu2/3 selective PAMs with no in vitro activity at mGlu1,4-8 or 45 other CNS receptors. In vitro pharmacological characterization of representative compound 44 indicated agonist-PAM activity toward mGlu2 and PAM activity at mGlu3. The most potent mGlu2/3 PAMs were characterized in assays predictive of ADME/T and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, allowing the discovery of systemically active mGlu2/3 PAMs. On the basis of its overall profile, compound 74 was selected for behavioral studies and was shown to dose-dependently decrease cocaine self-administration in rats after intraperitoneal administration.

Penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the therapeutic target is a major obstacle in development. The rapid CNS penetration of salvinorin A has suggested that the neoclerodane nucleus offers an excellent scaffold for developing antiproliferative compounds that enter the CNS. The Liebeskind-Srogl reaction was used as the main carbon-carbon bond-forming step toward the synthesis of quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues. Quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues were shown to have antiproliferative activity against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, but show no significant activity at the κ-opioid receptors. In an in vitro model of BBB penetration, quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues were shown to passively diffuse across the cell monolayer.

As an approach to reducing side effects associated with κ opioid agonists, a series of β-naltrexamides 3-10 was synthesized in an effort to selectively target putative κ opioid heteromers without recruiting β-arrestin upon activation.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425012,20181006,219077|5311424|53472113|71533722|71549767|71549769|90417914,103169903|103399782|312391005|312391006|312391011|312391013|312391014,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Selective introduction of the κ pharmacophoric structural elements pyrrolidine and 3,4-dichlorophenylacetamide with a two-carbon distance afforded conformationally restricted κ agonists 13-15 based on the quinoxaline ring system. In competitive radioligand receptor binding studies the benzylamine 13b, the secondary amine 14b, and the carbamate 15 displayed high κ receptor affinity. The Ki value of the lead compound derived methoxycarbonyl derivative 15 is 9.7nM. However, the κ affinity of 15 is exceeded by 13b and 14b with a basic functional group instead of the methoxycarbonyl group in 1-position of the quinoxaline system. The chlorine atoms of the dichlorophenylacetyl residue are essential, since the corresponding phenylacetyl analogs show considerably reduced κ affinity. The potent κ ligands 13b, 14b and 15 are selective over the related μ- and δ-opioid receptors, σ1, σ2 and NMDA receptors.

Attempts to alter the mu-selectivity of [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO)-related glycopeptides by altering the charged residues of the amphipathic helical address were unsuccessful. A series of pan-agonists was evaluated for antinociceptive activity (55 °C tail flick) in mice. A flexible linker was required to maintain antinociceptive activity. Circular dichroism (CD) in H2O, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and SDS micelles confirmed the importance of the amphipathic helices (11s → 11sG → 11) for antinociception. The glycosylated analogues showed only nascent helices and random coil conformations in H2O. Chemical shift indices (CSI) and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) with 600 MHz NMR and CD confirmed helical structures in micelles, which were rationalized by molecular dynamics calculations.

Inhibitors of the bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of bromodomains have shown profound anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties, generating much interest in targeting other bromodomain-containing proteins for disease treatment. Herein, we report the discovery of I-BRD9, the first selective cellular chemical probe for bromodomain-containing protein 9 (BRD9). I-BRD9 was identified through structure-based design, leading to greater than 700-fold selectivity over the BET family and 200-fold over the highly homologous bromodomain-containing protein 7 (BRD7). I-BRD9 was used to identify genes regulated by BRD9 in Kasumi-1 cells involved in oncology and immune response pathways and to the best of our knowledge, represents the first selective tool compound available to elucidate the cellular phenotype of BRD9 bromodomain inhibition.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3774248,20180905,91668541,336867639,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25856009,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

Opioids featuring this residue at the N-terminus often display superior potency at one or more of the opioid receptor types, but the availability of the compound is hampered by its cost and difficult synthesis. We report here a short, three-step synthesis of Boc-2',6'-dimethyl-l-tyrosine (3a) utilizing a microwave-assisted Negishi coupling for the key carbon-carbon bond forming step, and employ this chemistry for the expedient synthesis of other unnatural tyrosine derivatives. Three of these derivatives (3c, 3d, 3f) have not previously been examined as Tyr(1) replacements in opioid ligands. We describe the incorporation of these tyrosine derivatives in a series of opioid peptidomimetics employing our previously reported tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) scaffold, and the binding and relative efficacy of each of the analogues at the three opioid receptor subtypes: mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3771802,20180905,127028132|127028133|127028436|127028437|127029584,336869858|336869859|336870266|336870267|336871980,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26713104,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

These shifts in functional activity are often accompanied by negligible changes in binding affinity. The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest.

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine.

The opioid hydroxy ketones prepared are antagonists at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. Docking simulations and detailed structure-activity analysis revealed that the presence of the 7β-hydroxy-8-ketone functionality in the prepared compounds can be used to gain activity towards the delta opioid receptor.

It is implicated in nociception, diuresis, emotion, cognition, and immune system functions. KOP agonists possess a strong analgesic effect accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria. On the other hand, antagonists of this receptor were found to block depression, anxiety, and drug-seeking behaviors in animal models. Recently, great interest has been given to the development of selective KOP antagonists as an addiction treatment that does not cause dependence itself or show high relapse rates like the currently used agents. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the KOP antagonists developed for this purpose together with their in vivo studies and clinical trials. In addition, a future perspective and recommendations for the work needed to develop clinically relevant KOP antagonists are presented.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4252141,20200619,90656087|90656088|90656089,242637683|242637684|242637685,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29107424,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Modification of the 17-amino side chain of the opioid ligand to an arylsulfonyl group and the 6-furan acrylamide chain to 2-pyridyl acrylamide led to compound 71 with improvement of the antagonist activity (OX1R, Ki = 1.36 nM; OX2R, not active) without any detectable affinity for the opioid receptor. The dihydrosulfate salt of 71, freely soluble in water, attenuated the physical dependence of morphine. Furthermore, all of the active nalfurafine derivatives in this study had almost no activity for OX2R, which led to high OX1R selectivity.

1433450,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to kappa opioid receptor (unknown origin),"Title: (+)-and (-)-Phenazocine enantiomers: Evaluation of their dual opioid agonist/σ1 antagonist properties and antinociceptive effects._||_Abstract: cis-N-Substituted N-normetazocine enantiomers possess peculiar pharmacological profiles. Indeed, dextro enantiomers bind with high affinity σ1 receptor while opposite enantiomers bind opioid receptors. In spite of their stereochemistry, cis-N-2-phenylethyl N-normetazocine (phenazocine) enantiomers showed mixed opioid/σ1 receptor profiles and a significant in vivo analgesia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available regarding the evaluation of σ1 pharmacological profile in the antinociceptive effects of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine. Therefore, the present study was designed to ascertain this component by in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, we tested the σ1 affinity of both enantiomers by a predictive binding assay in absence or presence of phenytoin (DPH). Our results showed that DPH (1 mM) did not increase the σ1 receptor affinity of (+)-and (-)-phenazocine (Ki = 3.8 ± 0.4 nM, Ki = 85 ± 2.0 nM, respectively) suggesting a σ1 antagonist profile of both enantiomers. This σ1 antagonistic component of two phenazocine enantiomers was corroborated by in vivo studies in which the selective σ1 receptor agonist PRE-084, was able to unmask their σ1 antagonistic component associated with the opioid activity. The σ1 antagonistic component of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine may justify their analgesic activity and it suggests that they may constitute useful lead compounds to develop new ligands with this dual activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4000648,20200620,11314197,136933674,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27721146,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Few studies have focused on understanding the role of conformation in these interactions. Herein we describe the synthesis and evaluation of both flexible and conformationally restricted compounds derived from salvinorin A. One such compound, spirobutyrolactone 14, was synthesized in a single step from salvinorin B and had similar potency and selectivity to salvinorin A (EC50 = 0.6 ± 0.2 nM at κ; >10000 nM at μ and δ).

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

Elevated plasma levels of the protein have been linked to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, adipocyte-specific overexpression of RBP4 was reported to cause hepatic steatosis in mice. We previously identified an orally bioavailable RBP4 antagonist that significantly lowered RBP4 serum levels in Abca4<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice with concomitant normalization of complement system protein expression and reduction of bisretinoid formation within the retinal pigment epithelium. We describe herein the discovery of novel RBP4 antagonists 48 and 59, which reduce serum RBP4 levels by >80% in mice upon acute oral dosing. Furthermore, 59 demonstrated efficacy in the transgenic adi-hRBP4 murine model of hepatic steatosis, suggesting that RBP4 antagonists may also have therapeutic utility for the treatment of NAFLD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4305300,20210302,118872292,440138775,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31079449,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Two compounds, which contain a piperidine (14) or an isoindoline (17) pendant, retained the desired opioid profile in vitro, possessed metabolic half-lives of greater than 1 h in mouse liver microsomes (MLMs), and were active antinociceptive agents in the acetic acid stretch assay (AASA) at subcutaneous doses of 1 mg/kg.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4381841,20210302,5288826|155512747|155514661|155516535|155516545|155516811|155539726|155554575|155559678|155566581|155569410,103169185|440113104|440116017|440118846|440118860|440119233|440155460|440192250|440204966|440222447|440229592,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31986033,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

These ligands have been shown to be active in vivo, do not manifest withdrawal syndromes or reward behavior in conditioned-place preference assays in mice, and do not produce dependence. Although these attributes are promising, these analogues exhibit poor metabolic stability in mouse liver microsomes, likely due to the central tetrahydroquinoline scaffold in this series. As such, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) campaign was pursued to improve their metabolic stability. This resulted in a shift from our original bicyclic tetrahydroquinoline core to a monocyclic benzylic-core system. By eliminating one of the rings in this scaffold and exploring the SAR of this new core, two promising analogues were discovered. These analogues (5l and 5m) had potency and efficacy values at MOR better or comparable to morphine, retained their DOR-antagonist properties, and showed a 10-fold improvement in metabolic stability.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4385893,20210302,5288826|155511829|155512448|155514601|155516761|155519639|155521541|155522280|155524713|155526411|155527807|155530441|155536261|155537458|155549043|155551876|155563400,103169185|440111735|440112666|440115919|440119164|440123530|440126618|440127742|440131472|440134079|440136235|440140252|440149126|440150942|440178200|440185275|440214384,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30924650,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

GPCR ligands that differentially activate the downstream signaling pathways are termed functionally selective or biased ligands. A class of novel non-catechol G protein-biased agonists of the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) was recently disclosed. We conducted the first comprehensive structure-functional selectivity relationship study measuring G<sub>S</sub> and β-arrestin2 recruitment activities focused on four regions of this scaffold, resulting in over 50 analogs with diverse functional selectivity profiles. Some compounds became potent full agonists of β-arrestin2 recruitment, while others displayed enhanced G<sub>S</sub> bias compared to the starting compound. Pharmacokinetic testing of an analog with an altered functional selectivity profile demonstrated excellent blood-brain barrier penetration. This study provides novel tools for studying ligand bias at D<sub>1</sub>R and paves the way for developing the next generation of biased D<sub>1</sub>R ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4392135,20210302,75201901|130442480|130442572|146025727,404702213|440142105|440146135|440215258,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30875219,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The H3R is considered as a drug target for the treatment of several central nervous system disorders. We have synthesized and identified a novel series of 4-aryl-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolinamines that act as selective H3R antagonists. Among all the synthesized compounds, in vitro and docking studies suggested that the 4-methoxy-phenyl-substituted tetrahydroquinazolinamine compound 4c has potent and selective H3R antagonist activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 0.04 μM). Compound 4c did not exhibit any activity on the hERG ion channel and pan-assay interference compounds liability. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 4c crosses the blood brain barrier, and in vivo studies demonstrated that 4c induces anorexia and weight loss in obese, but not in lean mice. These data reveal the therapeutic potential of 4c as an anti-obesity candidate drug via antagonizing the H3R.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4394822,20210302,155522219,440127640,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30998358,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity. Molecular modeling suggests that ML417 interacts with the D3R in a unique manner, possibly explaining its remarkable selectivity. ML417 was also found to protect against neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs. Together with promising pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles, these results suggest that ML417 is a novel and uniquely selective D3R agonist that may serve as both a research tool and a therapeutic lead for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4406633,20210302,119570|27842480|53475319,103245538|163332281|440152736,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32342685,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Among opioid analgesics, mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists are the most commonly used and are indicated for acute and chronic pain management. However, their use results in a plethora of well-described side-effects. From selective delta opioid receptor (DOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists to multitarget MOR/DOR and MOR/KOR ligands, medicinal chemistry provided different approaches aimed at the development of opioid analgesics with an improved pharmacological and tolerability fingerprint.

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429170,20210302,130431318,440152147,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430772,20210302,155532072,440142712,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However, selective MOR agonists including fentanyl and morphine derivatives are limited clinically due to high risks of dependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression. We recently reported the development of a long-acting, bifunctional MOR agonist/δ-opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist analgesic devoid of tolerance or dependence in mice (AAH8, henceforth referred to as 2B). To address the need for short-acting treatments for breakthrough pain, we present a series of novel, short-acting, high-potency MOR agonist/DOR antagonist ligands with antinociceptive activity in vivo. In this study, we utilized a two-dimensional structure-activity relationship matrix to identify pharmacological trends attributable to combinations of two key pharmacophore elements within the chemotype.

Selected structural modifications are made to the basic moiety and at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-positions on the piperidine nucleus to enable structure-activity relationships to be delineated. As a result, some highly potent and selective kappa-receptor agonists have been identified. In particular, this has been achieved by introduction of oxygen-containing functionality into the 4-position of the piperidine nucleus or the 3-position of the pyrrolidinylmethyl side chain. Thus, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]- 2-[[1-(3-oxopyrrolidinyl)]methyl]piperidine (10) possesses high activity in the rabbit vas deferens (LVD, kappa-specific tissue) (IC50 = 0.20 nM) and is a potent antinociceptive agent, as determined by the mouse acetylcholine-induced abdominal constriction test (MAC) (ED50 = 0.06 mg/kg, sc). The spirocyclic analogue 8-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-7-(1-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-1,4-dio xa-8- azaspirol4.5]decane (39) showed exceptionally potent activity: LVD, IC50 = 0.10 nM; MAC, ED50 = 0.001 mg/kg, sc.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2.

Isopavines as a new class of morphinomimetics and their human opioid receptor binding activity._||_Abstract: The importance of visual imagery and relational thinking manifests itself in a heuristic approach to the design and synthesis of potential morphinomimetics as agonists of the human mu receptor. The well-known class of alkaloids represented by the isopavine nucleus has a topological resemblance to the morphine skeleton, especially when viewed in a particular way. Enantiopure isopavines can be readily obtained from a 1,2 Stevens rearrangement of 13-substituted dihydromethanodibenzoazocines, prepared in four steps from d- and l-amino acids. Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor. X-ray crystal structures of several compounds corroborate stereochemistries and overall topologies.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751994,20181017,5284371|5288826|5359272|10366960|11139094|11184946|51004758|51009928|71449105|71450900|71458037|122197314|122197315|122197316|122197485|122197486|122197487|122197488|122197489|122197490|122197491|122197492|122197493|122197494|122197495|122197496|122197497|122197498|122197499|122197500|122197501|122197502|122197503|122197504|122197505|122197506|122197507|122197508|122197509|122197510|122197511|122197512,103169185|103169342|123085530|163312605|163315964|163315965|163319422|163329699|163329700|318463930|318463933|318463938|318463939|318464366|318464367|318464368|318464369|318464370|318464371|318464372|318464373|318464374|318464375|318464376|318464377|318464378|318464379|318464380|318464381|318464382|318464383|318464384|318464385|318464386|318464387|318464388|318464389|318464390|318464391|318464392|318464393|318464394,4986,In vitro,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12502358,0,,P41145,,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The most striking finding was the very large difference in kappa-opioid receptor activity between the diastereomeric ethyl ethers: 46-fold in binding, 150-fold in GPI, and 900-fold in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay in favor of the (R)-diastereomer. Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact. It appears that kappa-agonist binding of the orvinols avoids the inhibitory site in the intramolecular H-bonded conformation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755690,20181017,49799966|71459962,103770295|163333407,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10794701,0,,P41145,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873919,20181016,56657871,134434230,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,,P41145,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The lead agent 2-(4-pyridin-2-ylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (1, ABT-724) was discovered by optimization of a series of benzimidazole arylpiperazines. This highly selective D4 agonist was found to be very potent and efficacious in vivo, eliciting penile erections in rats at a dose of 0.03 micromol/kg, with a positive response rate of 77% erectile incidence. Even at high doses, it was devoid of side effects in animal models of central nervous system behaviors, emesis, or nausea.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1).

It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide.

The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors. However, bulkier homologs (hexyl through decyl) displayed higher enantioselectivity at kappa or delta receptors than at the mu (monkey) receptor. The (+)-butyl through (+)-octyl homologs were essentially equipotent with, or more potent than, (+)-pentazocine at the sigma receptor. Only the (+)-H and (+)-methyl homologs had high affinity (< 0.05 microM) at PCP binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750073,20181014,12371110|12371111|44342597|44342598|44342661|44342684|44342724|44342741|44342743|44342746|44342747|44342753|44342754|44342792|44342793|44342843|44342910|44342911|44342912|44342925|44342933|44342934,103339884|103339885|103339981|103339996|103340034|103340108|103340139|103340141|103340145|103340146|103340160|103340161|103340185|103340236|103340237|103340352|103340515|103340516|103340518|103340549|103340562|103340563,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7932569,0,,P41145,9527.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn.

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL747228,20181017,10408752|10527816|10574908|10599027|10718445|10883143|10926896|10938869|11036499|11090735|11784022|11795327|11811844|15548354|15548355|71456174,103357517|103357547|103357602|103357703|103357704|103357773|103357801|103357903|103357904|103358210|103358275|103358320|103358363|163322761|163326190|163326191,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6.

The affinities of the target compounds for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were determined by radiolabeled binding experiments using bovine brain membranes. An analogous series of 7,8-dihydrocodeinones and morphinones was prepared and assayed in the same systems. The 3-methoxy derivatives 3 and 4 were more selective than the corresponding morphinones for the mu receptor. The 5 beta-methylcodeinones 25 and 27 had lower affinity at all receptors than the corresponding morphinones, but the 5 beta-methylmorphinones had affinities similar to the morphinones 5 and 6. A similar pattern was observed in the 7,8-dihydro series. Two compounds, 5 beta-methyl-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydromorphinone, 20 (MET-CAMO), and N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydronormorphinone, 22 (N-CPM-MET- CAMO), acted as nonequilibrium ligands in antinociception and membrane binding studies. In mice after icv administration, neither ligand showed any agonist activity but 8-24 h after administration both compounds acted as potent mu antagonists. A Scatchard plot of the effect of N-CPM-MET-CAMO on [3H]DAMGO ([3H]D-Ala2, (Me)-Phe4, Gly(ol)5] enkephalin) binding to bovine striatal membranes showed that there was a significant decrease in the Bmax value and a marginal effect on the Kd value suggesting that the number of binding sites was reduced. When taken together, these results support the view that 20 and 22 bind covalently to the mu receptor.

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu).

This includes a range of 4-acyl and 4-carboalkoxy derivatives with the latter series showing the greatest kappa-agonist activity. In particular, methyl 4-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-3-[(1-pyrrolidinyl) methyl]-1-piperazinecarboxylate (18) displays exceptional potency and selectivity. It showed the following activities in functional in vitro assays: rabbit vas deferens (kappa-specific tissue) IC50 = 0.041 nM, rat vas deferens (mu-specific tissue) IC50 > 10,000 nM, and hamster vas deferens (delta-specific tissue) IC50 > 10,000 nM. Compound 18 is also a highly potent antinociceptive agent, as determined in the mouse acetylcholine-induced abdominal constriction test: ED50 = 0.000 52 mg/kg, sc. The activity of 18 resides solely in its 3(R)-enantiomer. The kappa-agonist activity in both the 4-acyl and the 4-carbamate series is sensitive to the size of the 4-substituent. In addition, it would appear that an appreciable negative electrostatic potential in this region of the molecule is an important requirement for optimal potency.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753313,20200703,3505,242084400,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8393489,0,,P41145,9986.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Evidence which suggests that mu and delta opioid receptors possess different stereochemical requirements._||_Abstract: Enantiomers of erythro-5-methylmethadone (3) were synthesized from optical antipodes of erythro-3-(dimethyl-amino)-2-butanol. X-ray crystallographic analysis of (-)-3 perchlorate revealed that it possesses the 5S,6S absolute configuration. It was found that (-)-3 is substantially more potent than its enantiomer (+)-3 as an opioid agonist in vivo and in vitro. In vitro tests (guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle and mouse vas deferens preparations) suggest that (-)-3 mediates its effect chiefly through mu opioid receptors. On the other hand, (+)-3 and the more potent enantiomers of methadone, (-)-1, and isomethadone, (-)-2, appear to have less mu-receptor selectivity and interact with a greater fraction of delta receptors than does (-)-3. The fact that the solid-state conformation of (-)-3 differs from that of (-)-1 and (-)-2, which show great similarity in conformational features, suggests that mu and delta receptors have different conformational requirements.

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752205,20181016,132913|134131,103310030|103310529,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists.

148747,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards opioid receptor kappa 2,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med.

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849963,20200704,5360515|44297100,103238133|131283791,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors.

These results indicate that a positively charged N-terminal amino group may be essential for signal transduction but not for receptor binding and suggested that its deletion in agonist opioid peptides containing an N-terminal 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) residue may represent a general way to convert them into antagonists. In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group. This was achieved by replacement of Tyr(1) with 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp]. Compounds were tested in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens bioassays and in rat and guinea pig brain membrane receptor binding assays. All analogues turned out to be potent kappa antagonists against Dyn A(1-13) and the non-peptide agonist U50,488 and showed only weak mu and delta antagonist activity. The most potent and most selective kappa antagonist of the series was [(2S)-Mdp(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (5, dynantin), which showed subnanomolar kappa antagonist potency against Dyn A(1-13) and very high kappa selectivity both in terms of its K(e) values determined against kappa, mu, and delta agonists and in terms of its ratios of kappa, mu, and delta receptor binding affinity constants. Dynantin is the first potent and selective Dyn A-derived kappa antagonist known and may complement the non-peptide kappa antagonists norbinaltorphimine and GNTI as a pharmacological tool in opioid research.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850367,20181017,44334227,103321574,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11543672,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process. We believe that this is one of the first examples for a Phase III drug candidate that was discovered and optimized, from start to finish, using in silico model-based methods as the primary tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL862261,20181020,9851104|11430856,103488450|103570372,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16722631,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3. One of the active constrained analogues, compound 4, exhibited subnanomolar mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.62 nM) and potent mu-opioid antagonist activity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM). On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed. In these compounds the octahydroquinolizine template of 4 was replaced by an octahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine scaffold. The new derivatives were tested for their binding affinities and in vitro functional activity against the cloned human mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. From this study, we identified compound 36, which displays high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.47 nM), potent mu in vitro antagonist activity (IC(50) = 1.8 nM) and improved binding selectivity profile mu/kappa and mu/delta, when compared to 4.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909852,20181021,134131|5284596|5360515|16094343|16094366|16094367|16094368|16094369|16094370|16094371|16094372|16094373|16094374|16094375|16094377|16094378|16094379|16094380|16094381|16094383|16094384|16094386|16094387|16094388|16094389|16094390|16094393|16094394|16094397|16094408|16094410|16094411|16094413|16094414|16094415|16094416|16094419|16094420|16094421|16094424|16094425|16094426|16094428|16094430,103170037|103310529|103503644|103503645|103503647|103503650|103503653|103503654|103503656|103503657|103503658|103503659|103503662|103503664|103503666|103503667|103503668|103503671|103503672|103503673|103503674|103503678|103503679|103503681|103503682|103503683|103503686|103503687|103503691|103503692|103503695|103503696|103503697|103503700|103503701|103503704|103503705|103503708|103503709|103503711|103503714|103503715|103503718|131283791,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149859,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine.

Thus far, a nonpeptidyl, highly selective and reversible mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist is unavailable. On the basis of our modeling studies, a series of novel naltrexamine derivatives have been designed and synthesized. Among them, two compounds were identified as leads based on the results of in vitro and in vivo assays. Both of them displayed high binding affinity for the MOR (K(i) = 0.37 and 0.55 nM). Compound 6 (NAP) showed over 700-fold selectivity for the MOR over the delta receptor (DOR) and more than 150-fold selectivity over the kappa receptor (KOR). Compound 9 (NAQ) showed over 200-fold selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and approximately 50-fold selectivity over the KOR.

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970721,20181026,105104,103177815,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

At present, there is little information available as to why this compound is selective for kappa opioid receptors. One approach to better understanding the mode of binding of 1 at kappa receptors is to systematically alter the structure of 1 and examine the effects on opioid receptor affinity and activity.

While the analgesic effects of these drugs are mediated by mu-opioid receptors (MOR), several studies have shown that antagonism or knockdown of delta-opioid receptors (DOR) can lessen or prevent development of tolerance and dependence.

Here we describe the isolation and pharmacological characterization of four novel, neurologically active purines 1-4, isolated from Haplosclerida sponges collected in the Republic of Palau. The structures were determined by analyses of spectral and X-ray data. Compound 1 induced convulsions upon intracerebroventricular injection into mice, with a CD50 value of 2.4 nmol/mouse. Purines 2-4 were active in mouse bioassays at higher doses. The seizurogenic activity of 1 was correlated with inhibition of neuronal GABAergic transmission, with only a modest impact on excitatory signaling, in electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons. Despite having a purine template structure, the inhibitory activity of 1 was not prevented by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Thus, 1 represents a novel substituted purine that elicits convulsions through its actions on inhibitory neurotransmission.

548689,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to opioid receptor KOR,"Title: Synthesis and pharmacological properties of novel hydrophilic 5-HT4 receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important signalling molecule in the human body. The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640635,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,,P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Binding studies revealed that all new 14-phenylpropoxymorphinans (11-18) displayed high affinity to opioid receptors. Replacement of the 14-methoxy group with a phenylpropoxy group led to an enhancement in affinity to all three opioid receptor types, with most pronounced increases in δ and κ activities, hence resulting in a loss of μ receptor selectivity.

This demonstrates the first reported results for both cycloaddition of the furan ring and functionalization via microwave-assisted methodology of the salvinorin A skeleton.

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects. These novel chemical entities could potentially be advanced to the clinic as new drug candidates for treating depression.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026507,20200626,45254040|56951368|56951495,160678244|160688954|160705128,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22171543,0,,P41145,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP).

659121,Confirmatory,Agonist activity at human recombinant kappa opioid receptor expressed in CHO cells assessed as calcium mobilization after 1 hrs by fluorescence analysis,"Title: Semisynthetic neoclerodanes as kappa opioid receptor probes._||_Abstract: Modification of the furan ring of salvinorin A (1), the main active component of Salvia divinorum, has resulted in novel neoclerodane diterpenes with opioid receptor affinity and activity. Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP). Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1.

However, a variety of adverse effects were associated with them, partially due to their relatively low MOR selectivity. NAP, a 6β-N-4'-pyridyl substituted naltrexamine derivative, was identified previously as a potent and highly selective MOR antagonist mainly acting within the peripheral nervous system. The noticeable diarrhea associated with it prompted the design and synthesis of its analogues in order to study its structure-activity relationship. Among them, compound 8 showed improved pharmacological profiles compared to the original lead, acting mainly at peripheral while increasing the intestinal motility in morphine-pelleted mice (ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg).

In the course of this study, we focused on the effect of the substituent at 17-N in nalfurafine on the binding affinity for the κ receptor. The exchange of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups, which are strong electron withdrawing substituents, almost completely diminished the binding affinities for the μ and δ opioid receptors, but the binding affinity for the κ receptor was still maintained. As a result, nalfurafine derivatives with 17-fluoro-substituted alkyl groups showed higher selectivities for the κ receptor than did nalfurafine itself. With regard to the κ agonistic activities, the conversion of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups led to the gradual decrease of the agonistic activities in the order corresponding to their binding affinities for the κ receptor. In contrast, the derivative with the bulky 17-isobutyl group showed lower affinity and agonistic activity for the κ receptor than the derivatives with the smaller functional groups. This research suggested that both the electronic property and the steric characteristics of the 17-N substituent would have a great influence on the binding property for the κ receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2318806,20200625,105104|6918287|71716140|71717967|71717969|71718579|71718581|71719794|71720405,103177815|103646514|164128185|164136686|164136687|164139519|164139520|164145085|164147884,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23200250,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

However, it now appears that biological diversity has evolved an alternative source. Specifically, at least two alkaloids isolated from the plant Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine ((E)-2-[(2S,3S)-3-ethyl-8-methoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b-octahydroindolo[3,2-h]quinolizin-2-yl]-3-methoxyprop-2-enoic acid methyl ester; 9-methoxy coryantheidine; MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG), and several synthetic analogues of these natural products display centrally mediated (supraspinal and spinal) antinociceptive (analgesic) activity in various pain models. Several characteristics of these compounds suggest a classic 'opioid' mechanism of action: nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors, competitive interaction with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, and two-way analgesic cross-tolerance with morphine. However, other characteristics of the compounds suggest novelty, particularly chemical structure and possible greater separation from side effects.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399075,20200629,5360515|68867300|71680922|71680923|71680924|71681076|71681077|71681078|71681079,131283791|174491695|174491696|174496752|174507179|174512307|174517359|174517360|174522568,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds.

Recently, clinical proof-of-concept was achieved for the treatment of primary insomnia using dual (OX1R/OX2R) orexin receptor antagonists. However, elucidation of the pharmacology associated with selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists (2-SORAs) has been hampered by the lack of orally bioavailable, highly selective small molecule probes. Herein, the discovery and optimization of a novel series of 2,5-diarylnicotinamides as potent and orally bioavailable orexin-2 receptor selective antagonists is described. A compound from this series demonstrated potent sleep promotion when dosed orally to EEG telemetrized rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3102643,20180928,25060119,194159569,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24215892,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The resulting peptide, 4, exhibits full antinociceptive efficacy in the mouse warm water tail withdrawal assay after intraperitoneal administration with potency similar to that of morphine.

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Part II._||_Abstract: The nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP) and its endogenous peptide ligand nociceptin/orphanin FQ have been shown to modulate the pharmacological effects of the classical opioid receptor system. Suppression of opioid-induced reward associated with mu-opioid receptor (MOP)-mediated analgesia, without decreasing anti-nociceptive efficacy, can potentially be achieved with NOP agonists having bifunctional agonist activity at MOP, to afford 'non-addicting' analgesics. In Part II of this series, we describe a continuing structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the NOP-selective piperidin-4-yl-1,3-dihydroindol-2-one scaffold, to obtain bifunctional activity at MOP, and a suitable ratio of NOP/MOP agonist activity that produces a non-addicting analgesic profile.

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285644,20200618,5748589|90678812|90678813,242640973|242640974|242640975,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the therapeutic target is a major obstacle in development. The rapid CNS penetration of salvinorin A has suggested that the neoclerodane nucleus offers an excellent scaffold for developing antiproliferative compounds that enter the CNS. The Liebeskind-Srogl reaction was used as the main carbon-carbon bond-forming step toward the synthesis of quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues. Quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues were shown to have antiproliferative activity against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, but show no significant activity at the κ-opioid receptors. In an in vitro model of BBB penetration, quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues were shown to passively diffuse across the cell monolayer.

As an approach to reducing side effects associated with κ opioid agonists, a series of β-naltrexamides 3-10 was synthesized in an effort to selectively target putative κ opioid heteromers without recruiting β-arrestin upon activation. The most potent derivative 3 (INTA) strongly activated KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR heteromers in HEK293 cells. In vivo studies revealed 3 to produce potent antinociception, which, when taken together with antagonism data, was consistent with the activation of both heteromers. 3 was devoid of tolerance, dependence, and showed no aversive effect in the conditioned place preference assay. As immunofluorescence studies indicated no recruitment of β-arrestin2 to membranes in coexpressed KOR-DOR cells, this study suggests that targeting of specific putative heteromers has the potential to identify leads for analgesics devoid of adverse effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3371070,20200623,102340665,312351639,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24978316,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425015,20181006,219077,103399782,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Opioids featuring this residue at the N-terminus often display superior potency at one or more of the opioid receptor types, but the availability of the compound is hampered by its cost and difficult synthesis. We report here a short, three-step synthesis of Boc-2',6'-dimethyl-l-tyrosine (3a) utilizing a microwave-assisted Negishi coupling for the key carbon-carbon bond forming step, and employ this chemistry for the expedient synthesis of other unnatural tyrosine derivatives. Three of these derivatives (3c, 3d, 3f) have not previously been examined as Tyr(1) replacements in opioid ligands. We describe the incorporation of these tyrosine derivatives in a series of opioid peptidomimetics employing our previously reported tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) scaffold, and the binding and relative efficacy of each of the analogues at the three opioid receptor subtypes: mu (MOR), delta (DOR), and kappa (KOR).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3771805,20180905,127028132|127028133|127028436|127028437|127029584,336869858|336869859|336870266|336870267|336871980,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26713104,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

In vitro competition-binding assays in HEK293 cells stably expressing MOR, DOR or KOR showed that in compound 9 the 1-naphthyl ring led to the retention of MOR affinity (Ki(MOR)=38±4nM) displaying good selectivity versus DOR and KOR. In the electrically stimulated GPI, compound 9 was inactive as agonist but produced an antagonist potency value (pA2) of 8.6 in presence of MOR agonist DAMGO. Moreover, subcutaneously administered it antagonized the antinociceptive effects of morphine with an AD50=2.0mg/kg in mouse-tail flick test. Modeling studies on MOR revealed that compound 9 fit very well in the binding pocket but in a different way in respect to the agonist LP1.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed.

We have explored the structure-activity relationship of a 3-(4-phenyl-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5-(aryl)benzoic acid antagonist scaffold, assisted by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a P2Y14R homology model. A computational pipeline using the High Throughput MD Python environment guided the analogue design. Selection of candidates was based upon ligand-protein shape and complementarity and the persistence of ligand-protein interactions over time. Predictions of a favorable substitution of a 5-phenyl group with thiophene and an insertion of a three-methylene spacer between the 5-aromatic and alkyl amino moieties were largely consistent with empirical results. The substitution of a key carboxylate group on the core phenyl ring with tetrazole or truncation of the 5-aryl group reduced affinity. The most potent antagonists, using a fluorescent assay, were a primary 3-aminopropyl congener 20 (MRS4458) and phenyl p-carboxamide 30 (MRS4478).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4189972,20200618,145973771,404687565,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767967,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These species generally grow in Asia and Africa and have been used in folk medicine for their apparent analgesic and antipyretic activities. Columbin (1) is of particular interest due to its structural similarity to the known kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist salvinorin A. Given that the KOR is of interest in the study of many serious diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction, obtaining natural or semisynthetic molecules with KOR activity recently has gained much interest. For this reason, in the present study, derivatives of 1 were designed and synthesized using known structure-activity relationships of salvinorin A at KORs. The structures of the columbin analogues prepared were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy, and their KOR activity was investigated in vitro by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Slight improvements in KOR activity were observed in columbin derivatives over their parent compound. However, despite the structural similarities to salvinorin A, neither columbin (1) nor its derivatives were potent KOR ligands. This work represents not only the first evaluation of columbin (1) at the KOR but also one of the first works to explore synthetic strategies that are tolerated on the columbin core.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4192727,20200618,145965612|145965848|145966903|145972508|145977620,404675479|404675848|404677433|404685658|404693322,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28718638,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

The decahydroquinoxalines 5-8 show single-digit nanomolar to subnanomolar κ-opioid receptor affinity, full κ agonistic activity in the [35S]GTPγS assay, and high selectivity over μ, δ, σ1, and σ2 receptors as well as the PCP binding site of the NMDA receptor. Several analogues were selective for the periphery. The anti-inflammatory activity of 5-8 after topical application was investigated in two mouse models of dermatitis. The methanesulfonamide 8a containing the (S)-configured hydroxypyrrolidine ring was identified as a potent (Ki = 0.63 nM) and highly selective κ agonist (EC50 = 1.8 nM) selective for the periphery with dose-dependent anti-inflammatory activity in acute and chronic skin inflammation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4009153,20200620,105104|86280667|117697800|117710394|137632074|137633864|137634296|137635412|137636954|137637157|137637610|137638013|137639933|137639991|137640513|137640628|137642394|137645421|137646062|137647271|137653556|137656159|137656268|137658170|137661659,103177815|318397604|381838231|381840257|381842583|381844879|381845188|381846466|381847332|381847528|381849397|381850368|381852987|381854568|381858381|381860162|381870159|381870671|381870928|381872816|381873352|381873506|381883251|381886575|381886931,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28218838,0,,P41145,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models.

Few studies have focused on understanding the role of conformation in these interactions. Herein we describe the synthesis and evaluation of both flexible and conformationally restricted compounds derived from salvinorin A. One such compound, spirobutyrolactone 14, was synthesized in a single step from salvinorin B and had similar potency and selectivity to salvinorin A (EC50 = 0.6 ± 0.2 nM at κ; >10000 nM at μ and δ). Microsomal stability studies demonstrated that 14 was more metabolically resistant than salvinorin A. Evaluation of analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties revealed similar in vivo effects between 14 and salvinorin A.

In a second campaign, κ-opioid receptor ligands were sought with selectivity versus the μ-opioid receptor. While hit rates ranged from 40% to 63% against the on-targets, they were just as good against the antitargets, even though the molecules were selected for their putative lack of binding to the off-targets. Affinities, too, were often as good or better for the off-targets. Even though it was occasionally possible to find selective molecules, such as a mid-nanomolar D2/5-HT2A ligand with 21-fold selectivity versus the H1 receptor, this was the exception.

Elevated plasma levels of the protein have been linked to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, adipocyte-specific overexpression of RBP4 was reported to cause hepatic steatosis in mice. We previously identified an orally bioavailable RBP4 antagonist that significantly lowered RBP4 serum levels in Abca4<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice with concomitant normalization of complement system protein expression and reduction of bisretinoid formation within the retinal pigment epithelium. We describe herein the discovery of novel RBP4 antagonists 48 and 59, which reduce serum RBP4 levels by >80% in mice upon acute oral dosing. Furthermore, 59 demonstrated efficacy in the transgenic adi-hRBP4 murine model of hepatic steatosis, suggesting that RBP4 antagonists may also have therapeutic utility for the treatment of NAFLD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4305299,20210302,118483320|118872292,374314022|440138775,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31079449,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Since neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor antagonists reversed opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, the present work was performed to synthetize two branched peptidomimetics, EKR and RKE, containing the opioid peptide endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9. Our data obtained from the in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate experiment demonstrated that EKR functioned as a mixed mu-, delta-opioid receptors agonist and NPFF<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist/NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist, whereas RKE acted as a multi-functional peptidomimetic with the mu-opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism. Furthermore, EKR and RKE completely blocked the NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth of Neuro 2A cells. In vivo antinociception studies found that supraspinal administration of EKR and RKE dose-dependently produced potent antinociception via the mu-opioid receptor in the tail-flick test. In carrageenan inflammatory pain model, spinal administration of EKR and RKE induced dose-related analgesia, which was significantly reduced by the opioid antagonist naloxone and the NPFF antagonist RF9. Notably, compared with morphine, intracerebroventricular repeated administration of EKR and RKE maintained prolonged antinociceptive effectiveness. In addition, at the antinociceptive doses, these two branched peptidomimetics did not significantly inhibit gastrointestinal transit. Taken together, the present work suggest that EKR and RKE behave as multi-functional ligands with the opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism, and produce prolonged antinociception with limited side effects. Moreover, our results imply that EKR and RKE might be interesting pharmacological tools for further investigating the biological function of the NPFF and opioid systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4333172,20210302,5311081|155515973|155520785,103347472|440118014|440125450,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30626554,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,1,1,0

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies. Compounds 4, 5, and 9 with agonist efficacies between 25% and 35% significantly attenuated motor deficits in the 6-OHDA-hemilesioned rat model of PD.

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM).

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity. Molecular modeling suggests that ML417 interacts with the D3R in a unique manner, possibly explaining its remarkable selectivity. ML417 was also found to protect against neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs. Together with promising pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles, these results suggest that ML417 is a novel and uniquely selective D3R agonist that may serve as both a research tool and a therapeutic lead for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4406678,20210302,119570|27842480|53475319,103245538|163332281|440152736,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32342685,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Orally administered CYM-53093 showed robust efficacy in antagonizing KOR agonist-induced prolactin secretion and in tail-flick analgesia in mice. CYM-53093 exhibited a broad selectivity over a panel of off-target proteins.

Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds._||_This AID summarizes SBCCG's probe development efforts to identify agonists of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR)._||_Two potential probes have been identified and probe reports have been submitted describing compound screening._||_From the primary HTS and subsequent hit confirmation (AID 1777) several hit compounds were identified. Hits were clustered into scaffolds and SAR studies were performed on compounds from several scaffolds reconfirming potency (AID 2284). Agonist activity was further confirmed for these compounds via image-based high content assays (AID 2133, 2359). Compounds were further tested for selectivity against the related delta (AID 2343, 2370) and mu opioid receptors (AID 2344, 2352). Two novel scaffolds were identified as KOR agonists with CID5236771 (ML139) representing the potent and selective probe for chemical series 1 and CID44601470 (ML138) representing the potent and selective probe for chemical series 2. _||_Details of protocols, compound structures, and results from the original assays can be found in PubChem at the respective AIDs listed below.",14,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A205-KOR-Agonist-Summary-Assay,20110104,5236771|44601470,87218782|87334039,4986,,NP_000903,NIH Initiatives,1664548|7483322|7592342|7649270|7890732|8137953|8574585|8585130|9022829|9346876|12954747|15090153|15090178|15289816|15525797|15542743|15935455|16353938|16353947|16483675|16924269|17105950,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Jeffrey Conn_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor_||_Grant Number: 1 R03 MH077606-01_||_The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR).

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent. Finding a specific agent that increase KCC2 function would potentially have therapeutic value, as increased KCC2 function reduces susceptibility to epileptic seizures.",23,Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening Facility,ED001_Antag_MDS,20090528,25067404,56405461,134|135|140|146|150|153|154|623|624|1128|1129|1131|1134|1136|1812|1813|1814|1815|1909|1910|2099|2550|2908|3269|3274|3350|3757|4543|4886|4887|4985|4986|4988|5734|6530|6531|6532|6869|10280|10800|14811|16177|24173|24208|24408|24410|25265|25399|29336|29412|29559|29709|81574|81812|83612|84109|257648|306255|101823647,,AAD14378|NP_000015|NP_000070|NP_000106|NP_000116|NP_000229|NP_000515|NP_000614|NP_000665|NP_000666|NP_000669|NP_000672|NP_000675|NP_000701|NP_000729|NP_000730|NP_000731|NP_000734|NP_000785|NP_000787|NP_000788|NP_000900|NP_000901|NP_000902|NP_000903|NP_000905|NP_000949|NP_001018087|NP_001034|NP_001035|NP_001036|NP_001049|NP_001091683|NP_001461|NP_001948|NP_005857|NP_005949|NP_006630|NP_032196|NP_032388|NP_036634|NP_036706|NP_036932|NP_037051|NP_057658|NP_058687|NP_058706|NP_058887|NP_058937|NP_071640|NP_110502|NP_112258|NP_112396|NP_113970|NP_671482|NP_899156|NP_937822|P49658|XP_001057307,NIH Initiatives,19279215,0,3.2.2.6,AAD14378|NP_037051|NP_058687|NP_671482|O35458|P02708|P03372|P04150|P04774|P07550|P08172|P08588|P08908|P08913|P11229|P13504|P14416|P15207|P18508|P20309|P21728|P21917|P22756|P23975|P24530|P25021|P25100|P25101|P25103|P25929|P29274|P30411|P30542|P31645|P32297|P35367|P35372|P35408|P35436|P35439|P35462|P41143|P41145|P43140|P46663|P48039|P49146|P49651|P49658|P63059|Q00960|Q01959|Q12809|Q96P65|Q99720|Q9R0C9|Q9UBS5|Q9Y271|XP_001057307,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1
1921,Other,Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Colleen Niswender_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator(PAM)_||_Grant Number: MH077607-1_||_To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits/endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins.",14,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A467-KOR-Agonist-HCS-DryPowder-Assay-3,20101201,662723|1423675|16447354|16447357|44601469|44601475|44620911|44620912|44620913|44620914|44620915|44620916|44620917|44620918|44620919|44620920|44620921|44620922|44620923|44620924|44620925|44620926|44620927|44620928|44620929|44620930|44620931|44620932|44620933|44620934|44620935|44620936|44620937|44620938,87334048|87334049|87544141|87544142|87544143|87544144|87544145|87544146|87544147|87544148|87544149|87544150|87544151|87544152|87544153|87544154|87544155|87544156|87544157|87544158|87544159|87544160|87544161|87544162|87544163|87544164|87544165|87544166|87544167|87544168|87544169|87544170|87544171|87544172,4986,,NP_000903,NIH Initiatives,1664548|7483322|7592342|7649270|7890732|8137953|8574585|8585130|9022829|9346876|12954747|15090153|15090178|15289816|15525797|15542743|15935455|16213533|16353938|16353947|16483675|16924269|17105950|17702750|18660457|19149644,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0
