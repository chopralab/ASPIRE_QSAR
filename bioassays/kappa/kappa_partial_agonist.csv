Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors.

Based on the SAR, its C-2 position is one of the key binding sites and has very little space tolerance (3-4 carbons atoms) and limited to only lipophilic groups. In our attempt to prepare PET brain imaging agent for mapping KOPR, a series of C-2 halogenated analogs have been synthesized and screened for binding affinity at κ (KOPR), μ (MOPR), and δ (DOPR). These C-2 halogenated analogs with sequential changes of atomic radius and electron density serve as excellent molecular probes for further investigating the binding pocket at C-2, particularly on the effects of α verses β configuration at C-2 position. The results of KOPR binding and functional studies reveal β isomer in general binds better than α isomer with the exception of iodinated analogs and none of the C-2 halogenated analogs shows any improvement of KOPR binding affinity. Interestingly, functional assay has characterized that 6b is a partial agonist with E(max) of 46% of the kappa receptor full agonist U50,488H at 250 nM (K(i)).

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP). Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1.

This study expands the structure-activity relationships on our original series by presenting several modifications in the lead compounds 1 (HS665) and 2 (HS666). A library of new diphenethylamines was designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically evaluated. In comparison with 1 and 2, the KOP receptor affinity, selectivity, and agonist activity were modulated by introducing bulkier N-substituents, a 2-fluoro substitution, and additional hydroxyl groups at positions 3' and 4'. Several analogues showed subnanomolar affinity and excellent KOP receptor selectivity acting as full or partial agonists, and one as an antagonist. The new diphenethylamines displayed antinociceptive efficacies with increased potencies than U50,488, 1 and 2 in the writhing assay and without inducing motor dysfunction after sc administration in mice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4019244,20200621,122589938|137631847|137632903|137634403|137638688|137640860|137642012|137643506|137646522|137646782|137647554|137649850|137651510|137654001|137655206|137655599|137656887|137660781|137660824|137662178,381837197|381838788|381841040|381847496|381850709|381850828|381852421|381854637|381859066|381859452|381860563|381863993|381866407|381870110|381871937|381872524|381878436|381885622|381885690|381887685,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28825813,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Biased ligands selective for either pathway are expected to regulate biological functions of GPCRs in a more precise way, therefore providing new drug molecules with superior efficacy and/or reduced side effects. During the past decade, biased ligands have been discovered and developed for many GPCRs, such as the μ opioid receptor, the angiotensin II receptor type 1, the dopamine D2 receptor, and many others. In this Perspective, recent advances in this field are reviewed by discussing the structure-functional selectivity relationships (SFSRs) of GPCR biased ligands and the therapeutic potential of these molecules. Further understanding of the biological functions associated with each signaling pathway and structural basis for biased signaling will facilitate future drug design in this field.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4371540,20210302,9912633,103734715,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29939744,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,0,1,0,1,0,0

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429170,20210302,130431318,440152147,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,,P41145,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects.

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP).

Members of the orvinol series of ligands are known for their high binding affinity to both KOR and MOR, but efficacy at the individual receptors has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, it is shown that a predictive model for efficacy at KOR can be derived, with efficacy being controlled by the length of the group attached to C20 and by the introduction of branching into the side chain. In vivo evaluation of two ligands with the desired in vitro profile confirms both display KOR, and to a lesser extent MOR, activity in an analgesic assay suggesting that, in this series, in vitro measures of efficacy using the [(35)S]GTPγS assay are predictive of the in vivo profile.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2340175,20200626,6324613|9848990|71624445|71624446|71624447|71624552|71624553|71624554|71624555|71624556|71624661|71624662|71624663|71624665|71624776|71624777|71624778|71624779|71624892|71624894|71624895|71625025|71625026|71625027|71625028|71625029|71625148|71625149|71625150|71625151|71625152|71625277|71625278|71625279|71625280|71625281|71625393|71625394|71625395|71717732,164129947|164129948|164129949|164129950|164129951|164132787|164132788|164132789|164132790|164132792|164132793|164135607|164135608|164135609|164135610|164135611|164138472|164138473|164138474|164138475|164138476|164141236|164141237|164141238|164144041|164144042|164144043|164144044|164144045|164144046|164144047|164146755|164146757|164146758|164149694|164149695|164149696|164149697|164149698|175265278,4986,,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23438330,0,,P41145,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

However, there is substantial interest in its activities at the kappa opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptors. This has led to an interest in developing compounds with a buprenorphine-like pharmacological profile but with lower efficacy at mu opioid receptors. The present article describes aryl ring analogues of buprenorphine in which the standard C20-methyl group has been moved to the C7β position, resulting in ligands with the desired profile. In particular, moving the methyl group has resulted in far more robust kappa opioid antagonist activity than seen in the standard orvinol series.

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies. Compounds 4, 5, and 9 with agonist efficacies between 25% and 35% significantly attenuated motor deficits in the 6-OHDA-hemilesioned rat model of PD.

Biased ligands selective for either pathway are expected to regulate biological functions of GPCRs in a more precise way, therefore providing new drug molecules with superior efficacy and/or reduced side effects. During the past decade, biased ligands have been discovered and developed for many GPCRs, such as the μ opioid receptor, the angiotensin II receptor type 1, the dopamine D2 receptor, and many others. In this Perspective, recent advances in this field are reviewed by discussing the structure-functional selectivity relationships (SFSRs) of GPCR biased ligands and the therapeutic potential of these molecules.
