These compounds, along with the corresponding Phe4 peptides, were tested for both agonist and antagonist activity in the GPI and MVD smooth muscle preparations. All but two of the eight compounds showed antagonist activity at 1 microM against [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) in the MVD when tested under reversible conditions; in all cases the Mel4 peptide had lower activity against DADLE than did the corresponding Phe4 peptide. At higher concentrations (10 microM) the two active Mel4 analogues, (benzyl)2Tyr-Gly-Gly-Mel-Leu (2a) and (allyl)2Tyr-Aib-Aib-Mel-Leu (3a), both showed weak irreversible antagonism at the delta receptor.

These cyclic analogues are structurally related to the linear opioid peptides dermorphin and beta-casomorphin (morphiceptin), which also contain a phenylalanine residue in the 3-position of the peptide sequence. The obtained results indicate that analogous structural modifications (configurational inversion at positions 2, 3, and 4 or N alpha-methylation of Phe3) in cyclic peptide 1 and in dermorphin-related peptides had qualitatively the same effect on opioid activity, whereas the corresponding modifications in beta-casomorphins had the opposite effect. These findings can be interpreted to indicate that the mode of receptor binding of H-Tyr-D-Orn-Phe-Asp-NH2 is identical with that of dermorphin, but differs from that of beta-casomorphins. The side-chain length of the aromatic residue in position 3 of cyclic analogue 1 was shown to be critical for receptor affinity and selectivity, suggesting that mu- and delta-receptors differ from one another in the relative topographical disposition of the binding sites for the Tyr1 tyramine moiety and the Phe3 aromatic ring. Cyclic lactam analogue H-Tyr-D-Asp-Phe-A2bu-NH2, containing a reduced-size (12-membered) ring structure, showed increased mu-receptor selectivity, whereas the more flexible, cystine-containing analogue H-Tyr-D-Cys-Phe-Cys-NH2 (11-membered ring) was less selective.

26,147933,Literature-derived,Relative potency with respect to morphine was evaluated for Opioid receptor delta 1 of guinea pig brain,"Title: Synthesis and activity profiles of new dermorphin-(1-4) peptide analogues._||_Abstract: A new series of 12 dermorphin tetrapeptides, W-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Xaa-Y (W = H, H2NC = (NH); Xaa = Gly, Sar, D-Ala; Y = OH, OCH3, NH2) were prepared by traditional methods in solution and tested for opioid activity. In binding studies based on displacement of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor selective radiolabels from guinea pig brain membranes, the new analogues showed a negligible affinity for the kappa binding site and a preference for mu- over delta-receptors with an evident dependence on N- and/or C-terminal modifications; H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-OCH3 was shown to be one of the most selective mu-receptor ligands reported to date. All these tetrapeptides display dose-related naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effects following intracerebroventricular (icv) or subcutaneous (sc) administrations in mice. In comparison to morphine, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and the guanidino derivative H2NC = (NH)-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-NH2 showed lower affinity for mu, delta, and kappa sites but exceptionally stronger analgesia: respectively they are 560 and 1550 times as potent an analgesic as morphine. Among analogues tested after sc administration, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-D-Ala-OH displayed the highest activities; they were respectively 22 and 30 times more potent than morphine on a molar basis.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

Unexpected O3-dealkylation in the opioid radioligand displacement assay._||_Abstract: O3-(2-Carbomethoxyallyl) ether derivatives of some phenolic 4,5-epoxymorphinan opioid ligands have been prepared in a simple one-step procedure, and their behavior in the radioligand receptor assay was compared to their phenolic precursors. These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand.

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752475,20200628,118718756,312365627,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective. The results with substitution of beta-MeTyr or Hat instead of Tyr also demonstrate that topographical modification in a conformationally restricted ligand can significantly modulate both potency and receptor selectivity of peptide ligands that have multiple sites of biological activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757182,20181013,44299404|44316570|44316571|44316856,103243877|103279850|103279851|103280379,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1320122,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The same absolute configuration (S) at the chiral center of the active (-) enantiomers was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. A varied degree of kappa receptor selectivity was a feature of this novel class of antinociceptive agents (mu/kappa ratio from 44 to 950 according to the nature of the basic moiety). SAR analysis indicated that the presence of electron-withdrawing and lipophilic substituents in para and/or meta positions in the arylacetic moiety and the pyrrolidino or dimethylamino basic groups are required to optimize biological activity. The lead compounds 28, 30, and 48 are among the most potent antinociceptive agents (ED50 ca. 0.020 microM/kg sc) and kappa ligands (Ki(kappa) ca. 0.20 nM) identified so far.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757335,20181013,14726060|15697327|15697361|15697362|15697363|19910578,103295763|103295806|103296276|103296358|103296538|103672429,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1652025,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The active conformation of the pharmacophore, with a torsional angle (N1C2C7N8) of 60 degrees, was defined with computational studies and 1H NMR. A quantitative structure-activity relationship study of the arylacetic moiety substitution indicated that the presence of an electron-withdrawing and lipophilic substituent in para and/or meta positions is required for good analgesic activity and kappa affinity. The lead compounds (2S)-1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmethyl )piperidine hydrochloride and (2S)-1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]acetyl]-2-(pyrrolidin-1-ylmet hyl) piperidine hydrochloride are the most kappa/mu selective (respectively 6500:1 and 4100:1) and among the most potent (Ki kappa 0.24 and 0.57 nM, respectively) kappa ligands identified so far.

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective. The results with substitution of beta-MeTyr or Hat instead of Tyr also demonstrate that topographical modification in a conformationally restricted ligand can significantly modulate both potency and receptor selectivity of peptide ligands that have multiple sites of biological activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL759011,20200628,44316570,103279850,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1320122,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance.

Pharmacological studies of SNF 9007 suggest a relationship between the ligand requirements of CCK-B and delta-opioid receptors, which further implies a possible structural relationship between these receptors. We have utilized topographical constrainment of the important Trp30 residue to investigate structural features of SNF 9007 that would distinguish between binding requirements in this region for the CCK-B and delta-opioid receptors. Thus, the four optically pure isomers of beta-MeTrp were substituted for L-Trp30 of SNF 9007. Receptor binding results suggest that the preferred topography of the Trp30 residue for CCK-B receptor binding may be the 2S,3S (erythro-L) configuration whereas for the delta-opioid receptor it may be the 2S,3R (threo-L) configuration. Molecular modeling studies of these ligands further support the recently revised receptor-bound model for CCK-B octapeptide ligands (Kolodziej et al. J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 137-149) and are in good agreement with the DPDPE-delta opioid receptor 'template' model (Nikiforovich et al.

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective.

The lowest energy conformation was found to exhibit an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence. It was suggested that an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence or a helical conformation induced by the conformational characteristics of the message sequence may be important for binding potency and kappa opioid receptor selectivity. Side chain to side chain lactam bridges between the i and i + 4 positions have been shown to stabilize alpha-helical conformation. Thus, a series of cyclic lactam analogues of dynorphin A(1-11)-NH2 have been designed, synthesized and evaluated by the guinea pig brain (GPB) binding assay and guinea pig ileum (GPI) bioassay to evaluate the conformational analysis prediction and, further, to investigate the conformational requirements for high potency and selectivity for kappa opioid receptors. Positions 2-6, 3-7, and 5-9 were chosen as the sites for incorporating cyclic conformational constraints. Cyclization between D-Asp(2) and Lys(6) in c[D-Asp(2),Lys(6)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to an analogue with pronounced potency and selectivity enhancement for the mu opioid receptor, whereas cyclization between D-Asp(3) and Lys(7) in c[D-Asp(3),Lys(7)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to a potent ligand (IC(50) 4.9 nM) with kappa receptor selectivity. The other analogues in the series proved to be less selective. The biological results led to the suggestion that the binding conformation for the kappa receptor may have structural requirements that are distinct from those of mu and delta receptors. Interestingly, analogues with a D-Asp at position 2, 3, or 9 were found to be more potent for the kappa receptor than analogues with an L-Asp at the same positions. It is suggested that the incorporation of D-Asp into position 2, 3, or 9 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 may have stereochemical and conformational effects on the nearby amino acids which can help discriminate the preference between kappa, mu, and delta receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750005,20181015,10677974,103241617,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8676350,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In binding studies based on displacement of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor selective radiolabels from guinea pig brain membranes, the new analogues showed a negligible affinity for the kappa binding site and a preference for mu- over delta-receptors with an evident dependence on N- and/or C-terminal modifications; H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-OCH3 was shown to be one of the most selective mu-receptor ligands reported to date. All these tetrapeptides display dose-related naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effects following intracerebroventricular (icv) or subcutaneous (sc) administrations in mice. In comparison to morphine, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and the guanidino derivative H2NC = (NH)-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-NH2 showed lower affinity for mu, delta, and kappa sites but exceptionally stronger analgesia: respectively they are 560 and 1550 times as potent an analgesic as morphine. Among analogues tested after sc administration, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-D-Ala-OH displayed the highest activities; they were respectively 22 and 30 times more potent than morphine on a molar basis.

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance. These results indicate that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan templates could provide ligands with mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist profiles and such ligands may have the potential of emerging as novel analgesic drugs devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756217,20181018,5462471,103217856,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14998329,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Their biological activities were determined in the three bioassays [guinea pig ileum (GPI), mouse vas deferens (MVD), and rabbit vas deferens (RVD)] and in the mouse tail-pinch test after intravenous administration. Some analogues that showed interesting activity in the bioassays and/or in the analgesic tests were further characterized in mu-, delta-, and kappa-representative binding assays. The obtained data indicate that modification of the enkephalin segment to give metabolically stable analogues with high affinity and selectivity for the kappa receptor is strictly limited and that introduction of MeArg in position 7 protects the Arg6-Arg-7 bond from enzymatic degradation without potency drop and change of opioid receptor selectivity.

[D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (20) showed a 40-60-fold more potent opioid activity than 18 in the three bioassays and produced a 3.4-fold more potent analgesic effect than 18.

Among the phenyl ring-substituted analogs, those containing the smaller and electron-withdrawing halogens were favored over those with larger, electron-releasing methyl groups, although delta opioid binding affinity was reduced in all cases. The m-fluorophenylalanine analog demonstrated the best delta binding of the group, with a Ki of 4.79 nM. Within the group of heterocyclic analogs, 3-(2-thienyl)alanine proved to be the best modification, displaying a delta receptor Ki of 1.38 nM, while the polar histidine analog suffered the greatest loss in delta binding (Ki = 317). Compounds containing pyridylalanine and thiazolylalanine were intermediate in binding affinity, with delta KiS ranging from 39.5 to 62.4 nM.

Of the two bivalent ligands (1,2) synthesized, only 1 had substantially greater antinociceptive potency in mice than its monovalent analogues (1a, 1b). Testing of 1, 1a, and 1b in the guinea pig ileum preparation (GPI) revealed a potency profile similar to that found in vivo, whereas no correlation was observed in the mouse vas deferens (MVD). Binding data indicated the same rank-order affinities at delta receptors as the opioid activities in the GPI and in mice. However, mu binding exhibited no relationship with activity.

A hydrazone group was employed as a linkage between the alkaloids and peptides. The binding data for mu, kappa, and delta receptors indicate that peptide portions of the analogues can modulate the receptor selectivity of the attached alkaloid pharmacophores. The selectivity for different opioid receptor types depends on a balance between the affinities of the message and address components. In cases where these components have comparable receptor affinities, the address can significantly shift selectivity by increasing affinity to one receptor type while reducing affinity to other types. When the message component has high affinity for a particular receptor type, the modulatory role of the address is expressed mainly by reducing the affinity of the ligand for other opioid receptor types.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758770,20181011,461776|5284604|5360515|44273477|49860168|49860169|49860170|56674946|90663908|90663910,103166802|103186355|103250876|104234924|104234926|104234927|131283791|134453407|242583867|242583868,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2879914,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Effects on opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity were determined. The results, which are generally consistent with reports of analogous modifications in linear and cyclic pentapeptide enkephalins, indicate that steric, lipophilic, and electronic properties are all important determinants of delta opioid receptor recognition. Specifically, modifications which increase lipophilicity or exert electron-withdrawing effects on the aromatic ring enhance binding affinity, while hydrophilic, bulky, or electron-releasing modifications are detrimental.

These enantiomers, (-)- and (+)-4.HCl, were prepared by esterification of the corresponding alcohols, (+)- and (-)-4a.

Analgetic testing in mice (hot-plate) and receptor binding studies indicate that (-)-(2S,4R)-4.HCl is approximately ten times more potent than its enantiomer. The results are consistent with the operation of the Ogston effect in the interaction of achiral 4-phenylpiperidines with opioid receptors. Additionally, it is suggested that the piperidine ring of these and other closely related 4-phenylpiperidines bind within a receptor subsite cleft whose dimensions exclude diequatorial 2,6- and 3,5-dimethyl-substituted ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755152,20181002,4741130|6542471|44272414,103184211|103184536|160686191,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6283082,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively).

Hydrophilic groups as determinants of selective antagonism of delta 1 opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in mice._||_Abstract: A series of amino acid conjugates (2-6) of naltrindole (1) were synthesized from 7'-carboxynaltrindole (7) in order to obtain delta antagonists that would have minimal access to the central nervous system (CNS) upon peripheral administration. All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844809,20200703,44353457,103366152,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors. Analogues (3 and 6-8) which were shown to have relatively weak delta-opioid receptor antagonist potency have their aromatic groups located in a space that is different from that of the more potent analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844954,20200703,5310988|5491688|5497186|6438353|46877673|46877674|46877676|46877677,103316748|103556473|103697951|103734768|103734769|103734771|103734772|103734773,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8126697,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

A change in chirality of Dmt at C alpha (1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 13) curtailed delta receptor parameters, while replacement of its alpha-amino function by a methyl group (3) led to inactivity; Tyr-Tic analogues 4 and 11 weakly interacted with delta receptors. N-Alkylation of H-Dmt-Tic-OH and H-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH with methyl groups produced potent delta-opioid ligands with high delta receptor binding capabilities and enhanced delta antagonism: (i) N-Me-Dmt-Tic-OH 5 had high delta opioid binding (Ki delta = 0.2 nM), elevated delta antagonism on mouse vas deferens (MVD) (pA2 = 8.5; Ke = 2.8 nM), and nondetectable mu activity with guinea pig ileum (GPI). (ii) N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) was equally efficacious in delta receptor binding (Ki delta = 0.12 nM; Ki mu/Ki delta = 20000), but delta antagonism rose considerably (pA2 = 9.4; Ke = 0.28 nM) with weak mu antagonism (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:5640). N-Me-(9) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) also augmented delta opioid receptor binding, such that 15 demonstrated high affinity (Ki delta = 0.0755 nM) and selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 20132) with exceptional antagonist activity on MVD (pA2 = 9.6; Ke = 0.22 nM) and weak antagonism on GPI (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:7180). Although the amidated dimethylated dipeptide analogue 14 had high Ki delta (0.31 nM) and excellent antagonist activity (pA2 = 9.9; Ke = 0.12 nM), the increased activity toward mu receptors in the absence of a free acid function at the C-terminus revealed modest delta selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 1655) and somewhat comparable bioactivity (GPI/MVD = 4500). Thus, the data demonstrate that N,N-(Me)2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) retained high delta receptor affinities and delta selectivities and acquired enhanced potency in pharmacological bioassays on MVD greater than that of other peptide or non-peptide delta antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844631,20200704,5497186|10596072|10668458|15384271|44336001|44336032|44336081|44336096|73351569|73353034|73353035|73355833,103324449|103324528|103324574|103324599|103324678|103324699|103697951|103700766|174505469|174510599|174510600|174520363,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9301674,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

Three of the 10 compounds, (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-9-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl-2-phenylethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10), (1R,5S)-(+)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methylene-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S)-(+)-14), and (1R,5S,9R)-(-)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methyl-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S,9R)-(+)-15) had subnanomolar affinity at mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.19, 0.19, and 0.63 nM, respectively). The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point.

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1017472,20181024,5284596,103170037,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a hydrolase, LTA 4H stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of the unstable epoxide LTA 4 to the diol LTB 4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and a chemoattractant of eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening. From this work we identified a series of benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzimidazole inhibitors.

One approach to better understanding the mode of binding of 1 at kappa receptors is to systematically alter the structure of 1 and examine the effects on opioid receptor affinity and activity. Currently, there is a paucity of methods described for the preparation of analogues derived from 1.

This led to the identification of hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH) as a peptide ligand that selectively binds CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. We find that hemopressin is a CB(1) receptor-selective antagonist, because it is able to efficiently block signaling by CB(1) receptors but not by other members of family A G protein-coupled receptors (including the closely related CB(2) receptors). Hemopressin also behaves as an inverse agonist of CB(1) receptors, because it is able to block the constitutive activity of these receptors to the same extent as its well characterized antagonist, rimonabant. Finally, we examine the activity of hemopressin in vivo using different models of pain and find that it exhibits antinociceptive effects when administered by either intrathecal, intraplantar, or oral routes, underscoring hemopressin's therapeutic potential.

Co-effectors in the extract improve the bioavailability of active constituents such as hypericin (1) (pharmacokinetic synergy). Unwanted side effects are preventable without remarkable loss of activity when the responsible constituent(s) are carefully removed during the extraction process, as demonstrated for hyperforin (3), which is responsible for the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, in particular).

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets.

These findings have important implications for psychoactive studies with this class of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1814858,20180919,119037|53388784,134438226|134453690,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21667972,0,,P41143,9606.0,198.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
522,617207,Literature-derived,Inhibition of delta opioid receptor at 10 uM by NIMH PDSP,"Title: N-Arylalkyl-2-azaadamantanes as cage-expanded polycarbocyclic sigma (σ) receptor ligands._||_Abstract: A series of racemic N-arylalkyl-2-azaadamantan-1-ols (9-15) and the corresponding deoxygenated, achiral N-arylalkyl-2-azaadamantanes (23-29) were synthesized and screened in competition binding assays against a panel of CNS targets. Adamantyl hemiaminals 9-15 displayed generally low affinity for both σ(1) (K(i) values= 294-1950 nM) and σ(2) receptors (K(i) values=201-1020 nM), and negligible affinity for 42 other CNS proteins. Deoxygenation of 9-15 to give the corresponding achiral azaadamantanes 23-29 greatly improved affinity for σ(1) (K(i) values=8.3-239 nM) and σ(2) receptors (K(i) values=34-312 nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1826464,20200629,56665109|56672196|56675439|56682093,134442395|134450449|134454026|134461651,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21788137,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

On the basis of receptor binding assays in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing cloned human opioid receptors, (S)-3-fluoro-4-(4-((2-(3-fluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)phenoxy)benzamide (25) had a K(i) = 0.565 nM for κ opioid receptor binding while having a K(i) = 35.8 nM for μ opioid receptors and a K(i) = 211 nM for δ opioid receptor binding. Compound 25 was also a potent antagonist of κ opioid receptors when tested in vitro using a [(35)S]-guanosine 5'O-[3-thiotriphosphate] ([(35)S]GTP-γ-S) functional assay in CHO cells expressing cloned human opioid receptors.

529,642501,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to delta opioid receptor,"Title: Synthesis, radiofluorination and pharmacological evaluation of a fluoromethyl spirocyclic PET tracer for central σ1 receptors and comparison with fluoroalkyl homologs._||_Abstract: The spirocyclic σ(1) receptor ligand 1 (1'-benzyl-3-(fluoromethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was prepared in four steps starting from methoxy derivative 5. Due to its high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.74nM) and selectivity against several other relevant targets, 1 was investigated as (18)F-labeled PET tracer and its biological properties were compared with those of homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 2-4. The fluoromethyl derivative 1 was faster metabolized in vitro than homologs 2-4. In contrast to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]2-4, the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 15 using the K[(18)F]F-K(222)-carbonate complex required heating to 150°C in DMSO to achieve high labeling efficiencies. Whereas radiometabolites of [(18)F]2-4 were not detected in vivo in the brain of mice, two radiometabolites of [(18)F]1 were found. Analysis of ex vivo autoradiography images provided rather low target-to-nontarget ratio for [(18)F]1 compared with [(18)F]2-4. [(18)F]1 showed a fast uptake in the brain, which decreased continuously over time. The brain-to-plasma ratio of the radiotracer [(18)F]1 was only exceeded by the fluoroethyl tracer [(18)F]2.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1941655,20200626,44474938|50994498|56840667|57402462,103697992|124958368|136930451|136943461,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22136765,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP). Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1. Collectively, these findings suggest that different aromatic groups appended directly to the decalin core may be well tolerated by KOP receptors, and may generate further ligands with affinity and activity at KOP receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026569,20180921,60150457|60150458|70681353|70683422|70685543|70687674|70689742|70691889|70696034,160667388|160667389|160672672|160678017|160683346|160688715|160688716|160694206|160704839,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22464684,0,,P41143,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In vitro competition binding assays against σ receptors revealed that arylalkyl N-substituents conferred selectivity for the σ(2) subtype, while alicyclic or polycarbocyclic substituents imparted high affinity for both subtypes. The σ(2) binding and subtype selectivities of N-arylalkyl-7-azanorbornanes was generally greater than the analogously-substituted pyrrolidines, indicating that steric bulk and conformational restriction around the nitrogen atom are likely important for subtype discrimination.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2033754,20200627,67786|122501|211262|238317|411735|10130293|11095339|22197529|66561968|70681573|70683685|70685835|70687957|70687958|70692138|70692139,103320980|103395884|103575311|160667855|160667856|160673196|160678560|160683898|160683899|160683900|160689251|160694698|160694699|160694700|160694701|160705400,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22607684,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Herein we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around a series of mGlu(2) receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). The effects of N-substitution (R(1)) and substitutions on the aryl ring (R(2)) were identified as key areas for SAR exploration (Figure 3). Investigation of the effects of varying substituents in both the isoindolinone (2) and benzisothiazolone (3) series led to compounds with improved in vitro potency and/or efficacy. In addition, several analogues exhibited promising pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Furthermore, compound 2 was shown to dose-dependently decrease nicotine self-administration in rats following oral administration. Our data, showing for the first time efficacy of an mGlu(2) receptor PAM in this in vivo model, suggest potential utility for the treatment of nicotine dependence in humans.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2183942,20180923,46182736|46182745,124957985|124967323,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23009245,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents. This Perspective provides a description of preclinical research conducted in the development of several different classes of selective KOR antagonists, a summary of the clinical studies conducted thus far, and recommendations for the type of work needed in the future to determine if these agents would be useful as pharmacotherapies for neuropsychiatric illness.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2327123,20200626,44129648,136928384,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23360448,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Compared to 1, binding affinities of the five possible pyridinyl derivatives for the μ opioid receptor were between threefold lower to fivefold higher with the Ki of the most potent compound being 0.064 nM. Docking of 8-CAC (2) into the unliganded binding site of the mouse μ opioid receptor (pdb: 4DKL) revealed that 8-CAC and β-FNA (from 4DKL) make nearly identical interactions with the receptor. However, for 1 and the new pyridinyl derivatives 4-8, binding is not tolerated in the 8-CAC binding mode due to the steric constraints of the large N-substituents.

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor.

We thus designed a series of variable-length (15-41 atoms) bivalent linked peptides with selective but moderate/low-affinity pharmacophores for the mu and delta opioid receptors. We observed a U-shaped MDOR potency/affinity profile in vitro, with the 24-atom spacer length (D24M) producing the highest MDOR potency/affinity (<1 nM) and selectivity (≥89-fold). We further evaluated D24M in mice and observed that D24M dose-dependently antagonized tail flick antinociception produced by the MDOR agonists CYM51010 and Deltorphin-II, without antagonizing the monomer agonists DAMGO and DSLET. We also observed that D24M sharply reduced withdrawal behavior in models of acute and chronic morphine dependence. These findings suggest that D24M is a first-in-class high-potency MDOR-selective antagonist both in vitro and in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4145319,20200618,10664865|145949356|145952136|145952209|145952964|145956549|145958618|145959553,404651789|404655772|404655869|404656984|404659208|404662139|404665137|404666467,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29939746,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

We herein report that potassium permanganate supported on iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate can be used as a convenient oxidant in the one-step, heterogeneous conversion of Δ7,8-opioids to the corresponding 7β-hydroxy-8-ketones. Details of the reaction mechanism are given and the effects of the substituent at position 6 of several opioids on the reaction outcome is discussed. The opioid hydroxy ketones prepared are antagonists at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. Docking simulations and detailed structure-activity analysis revealed that the presence of the 7β-hydroxy-8-ketone functionality in the prepared compounds can be used to gain activity towards the delta opioid receptor. The 7β-hydroxy-8-ketones prepared with this method can also be regarded as versatile intermediates for the synthesis of other opioids of interest.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4153266,20200618,46782151|145956193,404659690|404661659,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29649744,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

In order to study the effects of simplifying the structures of these compounds, a scaffold hopping strategy was used to design several novel sets of substituted isoindolines, tetrahydroisoquinolines and tetrahydro-2-benzazepines. The binding affinities of these new compounds for the sigma 1 (σ1R) and sigma 2 (σ2R) receptors were determined, and some analogs were identified that exhibit high affinity (Ki ≤ 25 nM) and significant selectivity (>10-fold) for σ1R or σ2R. The preferred binding modes of selected compounds for the σ1R are predicted by modeling studies, and the nature of substituents on the aromatic ring and the nitrogen atom of the bicyclic skeleton appears to affect the preferred binding orientation of σ1R-preferring ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4153418,20200618,132060720|132060733|132060734|132060743|132060746|132060752|132060763|132060770|132060776|132060812|132075278,404653221|404656024|404656499|404656632|404658729|404660063|404662671|404665338|404665926|404684558|404686633,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29656199,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is implicated in nociception, diuresis, emotion, cognition, and immune system functions. KOP agonists possess a strong analgesic effect accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria. On the other hand, antagonists of this receptor were found to block depression, anxiety, and drug-seeking behaviors in animal models. Recently, great interest has been given to the development of selective KOP antagonists as an addiction treatment that does not cause dependence itself or show high relapse rates like the currently used agents. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the KOP antagonists developed for this purpose together with their in vivo studies and clinical trials. In addition, a future perspective and recommendations for the work needed to develop clinically relevant KOP antagonists are presented.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4252126,20200619,145991902,404714933,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29107424,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Based on 3 functionally α6β2/3γ2 GABAAR selective pyrazoloquinolinones, 42 novel analogs were synthesized, and their in vitro metabolic stability and cytotoxicity as well as their in vivo pharmacokinetics, basic behavioral pharmacology, and effects on locomotion were investigated. Incorporation of deuterium into the methoxy substituents of the ligands increased their duration of action via improved metabolic stability and bioavailability, while their selectivity for the GABAAR α6 subtype was retained. 8b was identified as the lead compound with a substantially improved pharmacokinetic profile. The ligands allosterically modulated diazepam insensitive α6β2/3γ2 GABAARs and were functionally silent at diazepam sensitive α1β2/3γ2 GABAARs, thus no sedation was detected.

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite.

Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, the clinical pharmacokinetics for PT2977 supports the hypothesis that attenuating the rate of glucuronidation would improve exposure and reduce variability in patients.

Structural variations at the 5'- and 14-positions of this molecule gave insights into the structure-activity relationships for binding and functional activity. Subtle structural changes exerted significant influence, particularly on the ability of the compounds to function as agonists at the MOR. In vivo evaluation identified compound <b>20</b> (SRI-39067) as a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist that produced systemically active potent antinociceptive activity in tail-flick assay in mice, with diminished tolerance, dependence/withdrawal, reward liability, and respiratory depression versus morphine.

803,76378,Confirmatory,Tested for inhibition of amplification of electrically induced twitch in guinea pig ileum (GPI),"Title: Phe3-substituted analogues of deltorphin C. Spatial conformation and topography of the aromatic ring in peptide recognition by delta opioid receptors._||_Abstract: In order to study the contribution of the electronic, hydrophobic, and conformational properties of the amino acid residue at position 3 in deltorphin C on binding to delta and mu opioid receptors, a series of 5- and 6-membered ring and bicyclic amino acid replacements at position 3 were prepared by solution synthesis methods. In general, the substitutions were deleterious for high delta affinity (Ki delta) and delta selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta). However, several notable exceptions were recognized: peptides containing the constrained, bicyclic structures Aic3 and (R or S) Atc3 enhanced delta affinity, but only the latter increased delta selectivity 4-fold (= 2475) relative to deltorphin C (= 661); at the other extreme, delta affinity of N alpha MePh3 fell 900-fold. Bioassays of [N alpha MePhe3]-, [(R or S)C alpha MePhe3]-, [Tic3]-, [Aic3]-, and [(R or S) Atc3]deltorphin C using guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) for mu and delta bioactivity, respectively, revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.916) between MVD bioactivity and delta binding in brain membranes. [(R or S)Atc3]deltorphin C also exhibited the highest biological selectivity (GPI/MVD) (= 3,522), which was 3-fold greater than that observed for deltorphin C. Molecular modelling of [N alpha MePhe3]- and [(S)Atc3]deltorphin C established that these amino acid replacements for Phe3 produce alterations in the backbone (phi,psi) and side-chain (chi 1,chi 2) dihedrals which critically affect the flexibility of the peptide and possibly limit accessible conformations for its alignment within the delta opioid receptor. The data provide evidence that the delta receptor is sensitive to changes in the composition, conformation, and orientation of the side chain of residue 3 of a linear opioid heptapeptide.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL684401,20181014,10010455|10055958|10485385|44348435|44348542|44348645,103316202|103353318|103353645|103353949|103354012|103354013,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8254604,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic. The unique structural features of JDTic will make this compound highly useful in further characterization of the kappa receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751249,20181017,5480230|9956146|10951763|11016305|11070421|11091606,103171086|103171185|103698780|103698799|163336637|163336638,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12825951,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

These compounds, formally derived by the condensation of a benzene or thiophene ring on the piperidine nucleus of the recently described compounds 1, are from 3 to 7 times more potent as antinociceptive agents and with a longer duration of action than the original lead compounds. A similar N2-C1-C9-N10 pharmacophore torsional angle of approximately 60 degrees was also found for this class of compounds by using X-ray and 1H NMR analyses. The same absolute configuration (S) at the chiral center of the active (-) enantiomers was determined by X-ray crystallographic analysis. A varied degree of kappa receptor selectivity was a feature of this novel class of antinociceptive agents (mu/kappa ratio from 44 to 950 according to the nature of the basic moiety). SAR analysis indicated that the presence of electron-withdrawing and lipophilic substituents in para and/or meta positions in the arylacetic moiety and the pyrrolidino or dimethylamino basic groups are required to optimize biological activity.

The introduction of a hydroxy substituent in position 5 of the isoquinoline nucleus generated a compound, 40, which is 2 times more potent than the previously disclosed unsubstituted analogue 39 in mouse models of antinociception. A QSAR analysis of the 5-substitution clearly demonstrates that antinociceptive activity is inversely associated with the lipophilicity of the substituents. The substituted compounds described herein are less selective for the kappa opioid receptors than the unsubstituted isoquinoline 39. For example, the 5-hydroxy-substituted compound 59 shows high affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki kappa = 0.09 nM) and a Ki mu/Ki kappa ratio of only 5. However, a multiple linear regression analysis demonstrates a lack of correlation between antinociceptive activity and affinity for the mu opioid receptor.

Effects on opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity were determined. The results, which are generally consistent with reports of analogous modifications in linear and cyclic pentapeptide enkephalins, indicate that steric, lipophilic, and electronic properties are all important determinants of delta opioid receptor recognition. Specifically, modifications which increase lipophilicity or exert electron-withdrawing effects on the aromatic ring enhance binding affinity, while hydrophilic, bulky, or electron-releasing modifications are detrimental. These observations are in excellent agreement with quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) results reported for Phe4 modifications in linear opioid pentapeptide enkephalin analogues, suggesting that the Phe3 tetrapeptide side chain and the Phe4 pentapeptide side chain interact with the same delta receptor binding subsite.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756427,20181013,15659190|15659191|15659192|15659193|15659194|15659196,103215095|103215139|103215173|103215174|103215175|103215460,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1315870,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The in vitro pharmacologic activities of 7 and 9 suggest that the 14-hydroxy group plays an important role in determining the delta selectivity and potency of NTI and SIOM.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753257,20200704,5497186|9978201|44444966,103298007|103556472|103697951,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9651172,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Analogues cyclized between positions 5 and 11._||_Abstract: We have recently reported the synthesis of several cyclic disulfide bridge-containing peptide analogues of dynorphin A (Dyn A), which were conformationally constrained in the putative address segment of the opioid ligand. Several of these analogues, bridged between positions 5 and 11 of Dyn A1-11-NH2, exhibited unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu receptors of the central over the peripheral nervous systems. In order to further investigate the conformational and topographical requirements for the residues in positions 5 and 11 of these analogues, we have synthesized a systematic series of Dyn A1-11-NH2 analogues incorporating the sulfydryl containing amino acids L- and D-Cys and L- and D-Pen in positions 5 and 11, thus producing 16 cyclic peptides. In addition, Dyn A1-11-NH2, [D-Leu5]Dyn A1-11-NH2, and [D-Lys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 were synthesized as standards. Several of these cyclic analogues, especially c[Cys5,D-Cys11] Dyn A1-11-NH2, c[Cys5, L- or D-Pen11]Dyn A1-11-NH2, c[Pen5, L-Pen11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 and c[Pen5, L- or D-Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2, retained the same affinity and selectivity (vs the mu and delta receptors) as the parent compound Dyn A1-11-NH2 in the guinea pig brain (GPB). These same analogues and most others exhibited a much lower activity in the guinea pig ileum (GPI), thus leading to centrally vs peripherally selective peptides, but showed a different structure-activity relationship than found previously. In a wider scope, this series of analogues also provided new insights into which amino acids (and their configurations) may be used in positions 5 and 11 of Dyn A analogues for high potency and good selectivity at kappa opioid receptors. The results obtained in the GPB suggest that requirements for binding are not the same for the kappa, mu, or delta central receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749999,20181014,10080153|10677974|11818885|44350651|44350667|44350794|71454476|71459888|73345484|73348396|73350098|73350099|73350102|73350104|73351589|73353056|73353057|73356142|73356143,103241617|103358863|103358924|103359307|103359369|103359409|163322868|163333184|174485034|174494937|174500323|174500324|174500328|174500330|174505496|174510630|174510631|174520891|174520892,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7966152,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective. The results with substitution of beta-MeTyr or Hat instead of Tyr also demonstrate that topographical modification in a conformationally restricted ligand can significantly modulate both potency and receptor selectivity of peptide ligands that have multiple sites of biological activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750002,20181013,44316678,103280035,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1320122,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unexpected O3-dealkylation in the opioid radioligand displacement assay._||_Abstract: O3-(2-Carbomethoxyallyl) ether derivatives of some phenolic 4,5-epoxymorphinan opioid ligands have been prepared in a simple one-step procedure, and their behavior in the radioligand receptor assay was compared to their phenolic precursors. These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand. We conclude that the conversion of the O3(2-carbomethoxyallyl) ether electrophilic ligands to their parent phenols accounts for their activity in the opioid radioligand displacement assay.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750004,20181013,1223|443408|644209|5284596|5284604|5360515|5480230|5486554|5497186|10026312|10046467|10321082|10346220|10350630|10414887|10455862|10455974|10459444|10481516,103170037|103189159|103250876|103279059|103381210|103381309|103381569|103381570|103381656|103381934|103381936|103381980|103382010|103416406|103697951|103698780|131283791|160708234|242084509,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1335078,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The lowest energy conformation was found to exhibit an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence. It was suggested that an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence or a helical conformation induced by the conformational characteristics of the message sequence may be important for binding potency and kappa opioid receptor selectivity. Side chain to side chain lactam bridges between the i and i + 4 positions have been shown to stabilize alpha-helical conformation. Thus, a series of cyclic lactam analogues of dynorphin A(1-11)-NH2 have been designed, synthesized and evaluated by the guinea pig brain (GPB) binding assay and guinea pig ileum (GPI) bioassay to evaluate the conformational analysis prediction and, further, to investigate the conformational requirements for high potency and selectivity for kappa opioid receptors. Positions 2-6, 3-7, and 5-9 were chosen as the sites for incorporating cyclic conformational constraints. Cyclization between D-Asp(2) and Lys(6) in c[D-Asp(2),Lys(6)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to an analogue with pronounced potency and selectivity enhancement for the mu opioid receptor, whereas cyclization between D-Asp(3) and Lys(7) in c[D-Asp(3),Lys(7)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to a potent ligand (IC(50) 4.9 nM) with kappa receptor selectivity. The other analogues in the series proved to be less selective. The biological results led to the suggestion that the binding conformation for the kappa receptor may have structural requirements that are distinct from those of mu and delta receptors. Interestingly, analogues with a D-Asp at position 2, 3, or 9 were found to be more potent for the kappa receptor than analogues with an L-Asp at the same positions. It is suggested that the incorporation of D-Asp into position 2, 3, or 9 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 may have stereochemical and conformational effects on the nearby amino acids which can help discriminate the preference between kappa, mu, and delta receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750006,20181015,44269673|44269677|44269678|44269681|44269682|44269730|44269731|44269732|44269737|44269750|44269751|44269752,103177263|103177289|103177290|103177300|103177301|103177531|103177532|103177533|103177552|103177607|103177608|103177609,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8676350,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance. These results indicate that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan templates could provide ligands with mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist profiles and such ligands may have the potential of emerging as novel analgesic drugs devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756216,20181018,5497186|9805452|10365429|11153683|11186271|11190061|11213578|11351769|11359624,103697951|103734664|103734665|103734932|103734935|103734938|103734939|103734941|103734942,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14998329,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

In most cases, high affinity at micro and kappa receptors, and lower affinity at delta receptor was observed, resulting in good selectivity for micro and kappa receptors. A wide range of substituents can be accommodated on the nitrogen position. The N-(S)-tetrahydrofurfuryl analogue 11 displayed the highest affinity at all three receptors. The N-cyclobutylmethyl analogue 13 gave both high affinity and selectivity at kappa receptor, and N-2-phenylethyl analogue 18 exhibited good affinity and selectivity at micro receptor. Further modifications of the 3-substituent indicated that one H-bond donor was an essential requirement for good affinity at micro and kappa receptors. Similar modifications were investigated at the 3-OH group of morphinans: levorphanol (2a), cyclorphan (2b), and MCL-101 (2c) lacking the 10-keto group. The 3-amino bioisosteric analogues (40 and 41) displayed reasonably good affinity at micro and kappa receptors. The 3-carboxamido replacement (compounds 46-48) in the morphinan subseries resulted in similar affinities comparable to their corresponding 3-OH congeners.

We found the chiral 8-phenylamino (NHC(6)H(5)) cyclazocine derivative to have subnanomolar affinity for kappa opioid receptors and a 2-fold lower affinity for mu, opioid receptors. To determine if the benefits of (substituted)amino groups could be extended to the morphine core structure, we have made five novel 3-amino-3-desoxymorphine derivatives of general structure 5 where RR'N = H(2)N, CH(3)NH, (CH(3))(2)N, C(6)H(5)NH, and C(6)H(5)CH(2)NH.

The study showed that compounds 7-9 bearing the trans-cinnamyl N-substituent most closely reproduced the potency at the opioid receptor of the flexible N-propylphenyl or N-propylcyclohexyl analogues previously reported. Neither the N-substituted cis-cinnamyl nor the cis-phenylcyclopropylmethyl compounds 10 and 11, respectively, showed high affinity for the opioid receptor. However, the N-trans-phenylcyclopropylmethyl compound 12 closely approximated the affinity of compounds 7-9. Additionally, we found that free rotation of the phenyl ring is necessary for high affinity binding and mu receptor subtype selectivity as the planar N-substituted thianaphthylmethyl and benzofuranylmethyl compounds 13 and 14 had significantly lower binding affinities. Altogether, these findings suggest that the high binding affinity, selectivity, and antagonist potency of N-propylphenyl or N-propylcyclohexyl analogues of (+)-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (4) are achieved via a conformation wherein the connecting chain of the N-substituents is extended away from piperidine nitrogen with the appended ring system rotated out-of-plane relative to the connecting chain atoms. This conformation is quite similar to that observed in the solid state for 5, as determined by single crystal X-ray analysis. Additionally, it was found that, unlike naltrexone, N-substituents bearing secondary carbons attached directly to the piperidine nitrogen of 4 suffer dramatic losses of potency vs analogues not substituted in this manner. Using a functional assay which measured stimulation or inhibition of [35S]GTP-gamma-S binding, we show that the trans-cinnamyl analogues of (+)-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (4) retain opioid pure antagonist activity and possess picomolar antagonist potency at the mu receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755878,20181015,5360515|9840689|9906198|9973387|10808145,103234501|103234937|103234961|103235399|131283791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9599247,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Binding of the various compounds to opioid receptor types in guinea pig brain membranes was weak, and the pharmacologic activities in the guinea pig ileum were marginal.

In binding studies based on displacement of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor selective radiolabels from guinea pig brain membranes, the new analogues showed a negligible affinity for the kappa binding site and a preference for mu- over delta-receptors with an evident dependence on N- and/or C-terminal modifications; H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-OCH3 was shown to be one of the most selective mu-receptor ligands reported to date.

The use of these neuroactive peptides in diverse studies has led to an increased understanding of brain function. Unfortunately, the use of brain-derived peptides as pharmaceutical agents to alter brain chemistry in vivo has lagged because peptides do not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Attachment of simple sugars to enkephalins increases their penetration of the blood-brain barrier and allows the resulting glycopeptide analogues to function effectively as drugs. The delta-selective glycosylated Leu-enkephalin amide 2, H(2)N-Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ser(beta-D-Glc)-CONH(2), produces analgesic effects similar to morphine, even when administered peripherally, yet possesses reduced dependence liability as indicated by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal studies.

In mice BSINTX antagonized the delta 1-selective agonist, [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin without significantly affecting the antinociceptive potency of delta 2, mu, and kappa agonists.

1018,150088,Confirmatory,Binding affinity against Opioid receptor delta 1,"Title: Molecular docking reveals a novel binding site model for fentanyl at the mu-opioid receptor._||_Abstract: The ligand binding modes of a series of fentanyl derivatives are examined using a combination of conformational analysis and molecular docking to the mu-opioid receptor. Condensed-phase molecular dynamics simulations are applied to evaluate potential relationships between ligand conformation and fentanyl substitution and to generate probable 'bioactive' structures for the ligand series. Automated docking of the largely populated solution conformers identified a common binding site orientation that places the N-phenethyl group of fentanyl deep in a crevice between transmembrane (TM) helices II and III while the N-phenylpropanamide group projected toward a pocket formed by TM-III, -VI, and -VII domains. An analysis of the binding modes indicates the most potent fentanyl derivatives adopt an extended conformation both in solution and in the bound state, suggesting binding affinity may depend on the conformational preferences of the ligands. The results are consistent with ligand binding data derived from chimeric and mutant receptor studies as well as structure-activity relationship data reported on a wide range of fentanyl analogues. The binding site model is also compared to that of N-phenethylnormorphine. An overlay of the bound conformation of the opiate and cis-3-methylfentanyl shows the N-phenethyl groups occupy equivalent binding domains in the receptor. While the cationic amines of both ligand classes were found docked to an established anchor site (D149 in TM-III), no overlap was observed between the N-phenylpropanamide group and the remaining components of the opiate scaffold. The unique binding mode(s) proposed for the fentanyl series may, in part, explain the difficulties encountered in defining models of recognition at the mu-receptor and suggest opioid receptors may display multiple binding epitopes. Furthermore, the results provide new insight to the design of experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis to the differential selectivities of ligands at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756180,20181017,3345|62156|124716|3041260|9976188|10021831|10428991,103173010|103182112|103224159|103349831|103349832|103349834|103734588,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10669565,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hydrophilic groups as determinants of selective antagonism of delta 1 opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in mice._||_Abstract: A series of amino acid conjugates (2-6) of naltrindole (1) were synthesized from 7'-carboxynaltrindole (7) in order to obtain delta antagonists that would have minimal access to the central nervous system (CNS) upon peripheral administration. All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000.

The benzyl 5 and phenethyl 6 esters possessed irreversible mu antagonist potency that was of similar magnitude to that of beta-FNA in the GPI. In the MVD, all esters appeared to irreversibly block the agonist effect of morphine, but none of the compounds irreversibly antagonized [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin to a significant degree. [3H]Dihydromorphine displacement studies revealed no relationship between the affinity of the esters 1-6 and the irreversible blockage of mu receptors in the GPI or MVD. Possible reasons for the observed structure-activity relationship are discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850199,20200628,5311018,103592778,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020246,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective. The results with substitution of beta-MeTyr or Hat instead of Tyr also demonstrate that topographical modification in a conformationally restricted ligand can significantly modulate both potency and receptor selectivity of peptide ligands that have multiple sites of biological activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL851384,20200628,44316678,103280035,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1320122,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain.

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1013977,20181024,5284596,103170037,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a hydrolase, LTA 4H stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of the unstable epoxide LTA 4 to the diol LTB 4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and a chemoattractant of eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening. From this work we identified a series of benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzimidazole inhibitors. SAR studies resulted in the identification of several potent inhibitors with an appropriate cross-reactivity profile and excellent PK/PD properties.

The series similarity to previously reported sigma ligands prompted analysis at sigma receptors to determine the SAR for affinity at sigma receptors. Within the N-substituent series the saturated analogs showed increased affinity at both sigma receptors. Optimal chain length in the N-arylalkyl series for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors proved to be N-propylphenyl; extension to a four carbon chain dramatically decreased affinity at both receptors. Substituents in the 4-position affect only sigma(1) affinity; no change in affinity at sigma(2) was shown. The N-isobutyl, N-phenylpropyl, and N-benzyl analogs are worth pursuing due to their good affinity and selectivity at the sigma(1) receptor, whereas the N-benzyl analog exhibits the greatest selectivity for sigma(1).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL995855,20181026,62513|191408|13046858|13599612|18997149|24885962|24885965|24886211|24886213,103628005|103628006|103628007|103628060|103628061|103628062|103628063|103628064|103628065,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17988766,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
1215,350954,Literature-derived,Inhibition of delta opioid receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022874,20180910,17758320,103530856,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

To identify a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors, we used the recently described conformation-state sensitive antibodies and screened a panel of endogenous peptides from rodent brain or adipose tissue. This led to the identification of hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH) as a peptide ligand that selectively binds CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. We find that hemopressin is a CB(1) receptor-selective antagonist, because it is able to efficiently block signaling by CB(1) receptors but not by other members of family A G protein-coupled receptors (including the closely related CB(2) receptors). Hemopressin also behaves as an inverse agonist of CB(1) receptors, because it is able to block the constitutive activity of these receptors to the same extent as its well characterized antagonist, rimonabant. Finally, we examine the activity of hemopressin in vivo using different models of pain and find that it exhibits antinociceptive effects when administered by either intrathecal, intraplantar, or oral routes, underscoring hemopressin's therapeutic potential.

However, tritium has many limitations. Its low specific activity and limited counting efficiency makes it difficult to examine low abundant, high affinity sites and its disposal is problematic due to the need to use organic scintillants and its relatively long half-life. To overcome these issues, we have synthesized both unlabeled and carrier-free radioiodinated iodobenzoyl derivatives of 6β-naltrexamine ((125)I-BNtxA, 18), 6β-naloxamine ((125)I-BNalA, 19) and 6β-oxymorphamine ((125)I-BOxyA, 20) with specific activities of 2100Ci/mmol. To optimize the utility of the radioligand, we designed a synthesis in which the radiolabel is incorporated in the last synthetic step, which required the selective iodination of the benzoyl moiety without incorporation into the phenolic A ring.

However, tritium has many limitations. Its low specific activity and limited counting efficiency makes it difficult to examine low abundant, high affinity sites and its disposal is problematic due to the need to use organic scintillants and its relatively long half-life. To overcome these issues, we have synthesized both unlabeled and carrier-free radioiodinated iodobenzoyl derivatives of 6β-naltrexamine ((125)I-BNtxA, 18), 6β-naloxamine ((125)I-BNalA, 19) and 6β-oxymorphamine ((125)I-BOxyA, 20) with specific activities of 2100Ci/mmol. To optimize the utility of the radioligand, we designed a synthesis in which the radiolabel is incorporated in the last synthetic step, which required the selective iodination of the benzoyl moiety without incorporation into the phenolic A ring. Competition studies demonstrated high affinity of the unlabelled compounds for opioid receptors in transfected cell lines, as did the direct binding of the (125)I-ligands to the opioid receptors.

The presence of the Pro(2) represents a crucial factor for the ligand structural and conformational properties. Proline is in fact an efficient stereochemical spacer, capable of inducing favorable spatial orientation of aromatic rings, a key factor for ligand recognition and interaction with receptors. Here the Pro(2) has been replaced by 4(S)-NH(2)-2(S)-proline (cAmp), a proline/GABA cis-chimera residue. This bivalent amino acid maintains the capacity to influenc the tetrapeptide conformation and offers the opportunity to generate new linear models and unusually constrained cyclic analogues characterized by an N-terminal Tyr bearing a free α-amino group. The results indicate that the new analogues do not show affinity for both δ and κ opioid receptors and bind only poorly to the μ receptors (for cyclopeptide 9: K(i)(μ) = 660 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 1.4% at 1 μM; for linear tetrapeptide acid 13: K(i)(μ) = 2000 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 0% at 1 μM; for linear tetrapeptide amide 15: K(i)(μ) = 310 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 894 nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2049660,20200627,57385006|70684123|70686263,160674315|160679653|160685014,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22394120,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents.

The effect on the opioid binding affinity was evaluated, by means of ligand stimulated binding assays, which indicated a high nanomolar affinity toward the μ-receptor, with appreciable μ/δ selectivity, for some of the new compounds. The three-dimensional properties of the high affinity μ opioid receptor (MOR) ligands were investigated by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, molecular dynamics, and docking studies.

Opioid peptides are very sensitive to certain structural modifications, making these labeling methods untenable. In our model opioid peptide, α-neoendorphin, we replaced a tyrosyl hydroxyl with an iodine, and in cell lines stably expressing mu, delta, or kappa opioid receptors, we saw no negative effects on binding. We then optimized a repurposed Sandmeyer reaction using copper(I) catalysts with non-redoxing/non-nucleophilic ligands, bringing the radiochemical yield up to around 30%, and site-selectively incorporated radioactive iodine into this position under non-oxidizing reaction conditions, which should be broadly compatible with most peptides.

C7- and C8-substituted 5-phenylmorphan opioids from diastereoselective alkylation._||_Abstract: The exploration of the effect of substituents at C7 and C8 of the 5-phenylmorphans on their affinity for opioid receptors was enabled by our recently introduced 'one pot' diastereoselective synthesis that provided C7-oxo, hydroxy and alkyl substituents, C8-alkyl substituted 5-phenylmorphans, and compounds that had a new cyclohexane ring that includes the C7 and C8 carbon atoms of the 5-phenylmorphan. The affinity of the 5-phenylmorphans for opioid receptors is increased by a C8-methyl substituent, compared with its C7 analog. The affinity of the newly synthesized compounds is generally for the μ-opioid receptor, rather than the δ- or κ-receptors. Addition of a new cyclohexane ring to the C7 and C8 positions on the cyclohexane ring of the 5-phenylmorphans enhances μ-receptor affinity, bringing the Ki to the subnanomolar level. Unexpectedly, the N-methyl substituted compounds generally had higher affinity than comparable N-phenethyl-substituted relatives.

Scaffold optimization revealed a novel rearrangement affording amidines, specifically compound 45, which was found to potently inhibit several VEEV strains in the low nanomolar range without cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.02-0.04 μM, CC50 > 50 μM) while limiting in vitro viral replication (EC90 = 0.17 μM). Brain exposure was observed in mice with 45. Significant protection was observed in VEEV-infected mice at 5 mg kg(-1) day(-1) and viral replication appeared to be inhibited through interference of viral nonstructural proteins.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3383687,20200625,71301451,242589776,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25244572,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The vast structural diversity of this group of polyketides is largely introduced by enzymatic oxidations, which can significantly influence the bioactivity profile. Four new compounds, griseorhodins D-F, were isolated from a griseorhodin producer, Streptomyces sp. CN48+, based upon their enhancement of calcium uptake in a mouse dorsal root ganglion primary cell culture assay. Two of these compounds, griseorhodins D1 and D2, were shown to be identical to the major, previously uncharacterized products of a grhM mutant in an earlier griseorhodin biosynthesis study. Their structures enabled the establishment of a more complete hypothesis for the biosynthesis of griseorhodins and related compounds. The other two compounds, griseorhodins E and F, represent new products of post-polyketide synthase tailoring in griseorhodin biosynthesis and showed significant binding activity in a human dopamine active transporter assay.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3366110,20181005,118706244,312346581,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24786728,0,,P41143,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The known μ-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist, buprenorphine, was structurally elaborated to include an amidoalkylamine linker moiety that was coupled with a range of fluorophores to afford new fluorescent probes. All compounds proved to be selective MOR antagonists. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the probe incorporating a sulfonated cyanine-5 fluorophore was the most appropriate for imaging studies.

This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented. (S)-(+)-10r is the first highly potent and selective chiral inhibitor of FAAH-COX with marked in vivo activity, and represents a promising lead to discover novel analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3779679,20200623,117072556,336877911,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26774927,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In previous studies we reported that compounds that did not have a hydroxyl on the 3-hydroxyphenyl group and did not have methyl groups at the 3- and 4-position of the piperidine ring were still potent and selective KOR antagonists. In this study we report JDTic analogs 2, 3a-b, 4a-b, and 5, where the 3-hydroxyphenyl ring has been replaced by a 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl or 3-thienyl group and do not have the 3-methyl or 3,4-dimethyl groups, remain potent and selective KOR antagonists. Of these, (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-(1S)-2-methyl-[4-methyl-4-pyridine-3-yl-carboxamide (3b) had the best overall binding potency and selectivity in a [(35)S]GTPγS functional assay, with a Ke=0.18nM at the KOR and 273- and 16,700-fold selectivity for the KOR relative to the MOR and DOR, respectively.

Important features of the cyclopropane ring are, the (1) coplanarity of the three carbon atoms, (2) relatively shorter (1.51 Å) C-C bonds, (3) enhanced π-character of C-C bonds, and (4) C-H bonds are shorter and stronger than those in alkanes. The present review will focus on the contributions that a cyclopropyl ring makes to the properties of drugs containing it. Consequently, the cyclopropyl ring addresses multiple roadblocks that can occur during drug discovery such as (a) enhancing potency, (b) reducing off-target effects,",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3857937,20200624,5284594,103256810,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27299736,0,,P41143,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or 99mTc for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) or the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEK cells transfected with μ (HEK-mu) or δ (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity.

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041172,20200621,72771081,242581035,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor.

A preponderance of preclinical data and clinical observations established p38αMAPK as a brain drug discovery target involved in neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction in multiple degenerative and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. We summarize the discovery of highly selective, brain-penetrant, small molecule p38αMAPK inhibitors that are efficacious in diverse animal models of neurologic disorders. A crystallography and pharmacoinformatic approach to fragment expansion enabled the discovery of an efficacious hit. The addition of secondary pharmacology screens to refinement delivered lead compounds with improved selectivity, appropriate pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. Safety considerations and additional secondary pharmacology screens drove optimization that delivered the drug candidate MW01-18-150SRM (MW150), currently in early stage clinical trials.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4602892,20210802,86270361,404668180,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30978288,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The benzoyl amide moiety of LY2456302 was changed into N-hydroxybenzamide and benzisoxazole-3(2H)-one to investigate whether it could increase the binding affinity or selectivity for KOR. All target compounds were evaluated in radioligand binding assays for opioid receptor binding affinity. These efforts led to the identification of compound 1c (κ K<sub>i</sub> = 179.9 nM), which exhibited high affinity for KOR.

Structural variations at the 5'- and 14-positions of this molecule gave insights into the structure-activity relationships for binding and functional activity. Subtle structural changes exerted significant influence, particularly on the ability of the compounds to function as agonists at the MOR. In vivo evaluation identified compound <b>20</b> (SRI-39067) as a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist that produced systemically active potent antinociceptive activity in tail-flick assay in mice, with diminished tolerance, dependence/withdrawal, reward liability, and respiratory depression versus morphine.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

1644,1924,Other,High throughput discovery of novel modulators of ROMK K+ channel activity: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Jerod Denton_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: High throughput discovery of novel modulators of ROMK K+ channel activity_||_Grant Number: R21 NS057041-01_||_The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium channel (ROMK, Kir1.1) is expressed in the renal tubule where it critically regulates fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (1).  An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.
