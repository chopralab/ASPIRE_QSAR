Functionally, 3a behaves as an agonist at the delta receptor with no measurable stimulation of either the mu or kappa receptor subtypes and was found to be devoid of any measurable amount of antagonist activity for any opioid receptor.

Hydrophilic groups as determinants of selective antagonism of delta 1 opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in mice._||_Abstract: A series of amino acid conjugates (2-6) of naltrindole (1) were synthesized from 7'-carboxynaltrindole (7) in order to obtain delta antagonists that would have minimal access to the central nervous system (CNS) upon peripheral administration. All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754635,20181015,44353390|44353391|44353454|44353457|44353458|44353468,103365942|103365943|103366138|103366152|103366153|103366185,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
147839,Literature-derived,Selectivity for kappa to delta opioid receptors was determined,"Title: Opioid agonist and antagonist activities of morphindoles related to naltrindole._||_Abstract: A series of naltrindole-related ligands (4-10) with an N-methyl,N-phenethyl,N-cinnamyl, or an unsubstituted basic nitrogen were synthesized and tested for opioid agonist and antagonist activity in smooth muscle preparations and in mice. The nor compounds (4 and 6) and the phenethyl derivatives (5 and 8) displayed full agonist activity (IC50 = 85-179 nM) in the mouse vas deferens preparation (MVD) while the other members of the series exhibited partial agonist or weak antagonist activity. In the guinea pig ileum preparation (GPI), all compounds except 8 were partial agonists. The ligands that were evaluated in mice were found to produce antinociception that was not selectively mediated via delta opioid receptors. However, two of these ligands (4 and 5) appeared to be delta-selective opioid receptor antagonists at subthreshold doses for antinociception. The finding that all of the compounds bind selectively to delta opioid receptors in guinea pig brain membranes together with the in vitro pharmacology and in vivo antagonist studies suggests that the lack of delta agonist selectivity in vivo may be due to a number of factors, including a basic difference between the delta receptor system in the MVD and in the mouse brain. Further, it is suggested that the constellation of message and address components in the morphindole nucleus may tend to stabilize delta receptors in the brain in antagonist state.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753310,20200703,5491897|5497186|10415050|11755589|44149909|44282798|44357097,103209239|103230026|103373428|103553488|103697951|103735285|103735288,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1333013,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Both 2 and 3 were found to be selective kappa opioid receptor antagonists in smooth muscle preparations, and they bound selectively to kappa-recognition sites. The thiophene analogue 2 displayed binding selectivity that was of the same order of magnitude as that of 1a, while 3 was considerably less selective for kappa site. This is consistent with the fact that the second pharmacophore in 1a and 2 displayed a greater degree of superposition than 1a and 3. The results of this study suggest that the pyrrole moiety of norBNI functions primarily as an inert spacer to rigidly hold the basic nitrogen in the second pharmacophore at an 'address' subsite that is unique for the kappa opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754285,20181013,46877617,103734661,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1849995,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties.

149069,Confirmatory,In vitro binding affinity to human Opioid receptor delta 1 on CHO cell membranes using [3H]diprenorphine displacement.,"Title: Structure-activity relationships of dynorphin a analogues modified in the address sequence._||_Abstract: The peptide [Pro3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 2 exhibits high affinity (K(i) = 2.4 nM) and over 2000-fold selectivity for the opioid receptor. Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL882757,20181013,46877644,103734704,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Chromatography of the mixture resulted in conversion of the bulk of the thiol 9 to the disulfide 13 by air oxidation. The disulfide 13 was also prepared by condensing the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether of 4 with the dithiodiglycolyl chloride and treating the resulting product with F- to give the desired product. The pure thiol 9 free of contamination with the disulfide was prepared by treating 13 with excess N-acetyl-L-cysteine and processing the reaction mixture without resorting to chromatography for purification. The corresponding N-(cyclopropylmethyl) nor compound 15 was prepared from the silyl ether 6 and acetylthioglycolyl chloride followed by hydrolysis, treatment with F-, and air oxidation. Incubation of bovine striatal membranes with 13 and 15 resulted in wash-resistant inhibition of the binding of the mu-selective peptide [3H][D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,Gly(ol)5]-enkephalin (DAMGO). Incubation of membranes with mu but not kappa or delta ligands protected the mu binding sites from alkylation by 13 and 15. The wash-resistant inhibition of mu opioid binding was partially reversed by the addition of the reducing reagent dithiothreitol (DTT).

The affinities of the target compounds for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were determined by radiolabeled binding experiments using bovine brain membranes. An analogous series of 7,8-dihydrocodeinones and morphinones was prepared and assayed in the same systems. The 3-methoxy derivatives 3 and 4 were more selective than the corresponding morphinones for the mu receptor. The 5 beta-methylcodeinones 25 and 27 had lower affinity at all receptors than the corresponding morphinones, but the 5 beta-methylmorphinones had affinities similar to the morphinones 5 and 6. A similar pattern was observed in the 7,8-dihydro series. Two compounds, 5 beta-methyl-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydromorphinone, 20 (MET-CAMO), and N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydronormorphinone, 22 (N-CPM-MET- CAMO), acted as nonequilibrium ligands in antinociception and membrane binding studies. In mice after icv administration, neither ligand showed any agonist activity but 8-24 h after administration both compounds acted as potent mu antagonists. A Scatchard plot of the effect of N-CPM-MET-CAMO on [3H]DAMGO ([3H]D-Ala2, (Me)-Phe4, Gly(ol)5] enkephalin) binding to bovine striatal membranes showed that there was a significant decrease in the Bmax value and a marginal effect on the Kd value suggesting that the number of binding sites was reduced. When taken together, these results support the view that 20 and 22 bind covalently to the mu receptor. On the other hand, when N-acetylcysteine and 22 were allowed to react in a buffered solution, 22 was recovered unchanged. Under these conditions no Michael reaction was observed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753264,20181013,11849246|11849365|44336988|44337160|44337164|44337243|44337264|44337269|44337271|44337273|44337274|44337275|44337276|44337314|44337316|44337344|46878245,103327006|103327386|103327396|103327546|103327576|103327594|103327603|103327611|103327612|103327613|103327614|103327722|103327724|103327783|103734817|103734823|103735536,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7693944,0,,P41143,9913.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
149481,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards Opioid receptor delta 1,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med.

In smooth muscle preparations, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the affinity labels 3-6 behaved as kappa agonists in that they were potently antagonized by norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). In addition to the high binding affinity and selectivity of the 3-isothiocyanate 3 (DIPPA) to kappa opioid receptors, wash studies have suggested that this involves covalent binding. In the mouse tail-flick assay, the 3- and 4-substituted isomers (3 and 5, respectively) produced long-lasting antagonism of the antinociceptive effect of the kappa opioid agonist, (+/-)-trans-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]acetamide ((+/-)-U50,488). In contrast, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the fumaramate derivative 4 were devoid of antagonist activity in the tail-flick assay. At substantially different doses, DIPPA (3) and the 4-isothiocyanate 5 also produced antinociception in the mouse abdominal stretch assay. In addition, DIPPA and the 3-fumaramate methyl ester 4 had improved in vivo kappa-selectivities compared to the unsubstituted parent compound (+)-S-2 and the para-substituted derivative 5. The improved kappa-selectivities of 3 and 4 and the different agonist and antagonist potencies of 3 and 5 may be explained respectively by the existence of multiple kappa agonist binding sites and distinct agonist and antagonist binding sites. In view of the antagonist selectivity and the apparent irreversible binding of DIPPA to kappa receptors, it may serve as a useful pharmacologic or biochemical tool to investigate kappa opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752611,20181014,127914,103215870,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7799399,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The potency and selectivity (delta- vs mu- and kappa-opioid receptor) were evaluated by radioreceptor binding assays. Agonist or antagonist potency were assayed in the mouse vas deferens and in the guinea pig ileum. In the TIPP analogues containing L-beta-methyl amino acids the influence on delta-receptor affinity and on delta-antagonist potency is limited, the [(2S,3R)-beta-MePhe3]TIPP-OH analogue being among the most potent delta-antagonists reported. In the D-beta-methyl amino acid series, the [D-beta-MeTic2] analogues are delta-selective antagonists whereas [D-Tic2]TIPP-NH2 is a delta-agonist. NMR studies did not indicate any influence of the beta-methyl substituent on the conformation of the Tic residue. The [(2R,3S)-beta-MePhe3]TIPP-NH2 is a potent delta-agonist, its C-terminal carboxylic acid analogue being more delta-selective but displaying partial agonism in both the delta- and mu-bioassay.

All the title compounds were devoid of significant affinity for both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, while some of them bound with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for kappa-opioid receptors. In particular, the 2-thienyl derivative 7A(X = H) with a K(i) = 0.50 nM represents a clear improvement with respect to tifluadom, showing a comparable potency but higher selectivity.

The compounds were biased toward opioid receptor antagonist activity by incorporating (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (a potent, nonselective opioid pure antagonist) as one of the monomers. The other two monomers, which included N-substituted or unsubstituted Boc-protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity. Screening of these compounds in competitive binding experiments with the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [3H]U69,593 led to the discovery of a novel kappa opioid receptor selective ligand, N-¿(2'S)-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamido]-3'-methylbutyl¿-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (8, RTI-5989-29). Additional structure-activity relationship studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen-bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. These sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-fold increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu-selective ligand, (+)-N-[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a). The degree of selectivity observed in the radioligand binding experiments was not observed in the functional assay.

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754168,20181015,44297100|44297195,103238133|103238445,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

This approach envisaged the delta opioid receptor to contain two major recognition subsites; a message subsite which recognizes the pharmacophore, and an address subsite that is unique for the delta receptor type and confers selectivity. The message and address components of the delta-selective enkephalins were postulated to be Tyr1 and Phe4, respectively, with Gly2-Gly3 functioning as a spacer. The message component of the target compounds in this study was derived from naltrexone and related structures. An indole system was fused to the C ring of naltrexone as a mimic of the address component. The benzene moiety of indole was viewed as the delta address component, mimicking the phenyl group of Phe4, and the pyrrole portion was used as a rigid spacer. Members of the series (1-23) were evaluated for opioid antagonist activity on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. Naltrindole (NTI, 1) was the most potent member of the series, with Ke values of approximately 0.1 nM at delta receptors. The antagonism by NTI was approximately 220- and 350-fold greater at delta than at mu and kappa opioid receptors. The binding of NTI and selected members of the series to guinea pig brain membranes was qualitatively consistent with their pharmacologic antagonist activity profiles in the MVD and GPI, but the Ki values were not in the same rank order. The selectivity of NTI arises mainly as a consequence of increased affinity at delta receptors. Thus, the Ke and Ki values of NTI were 1/530 and 1/90 that of the delta antagonist enkephalin analogue, ICI 174864. In contrast to NTI, ICI174864 derives its selectivity through greatly decreased recognition at mu and kappa receptors. The implications of the high affinity and selectivity of NTI as a consequence of its conformational rigidity are discussed.

149915,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]EK from Opioid receptor delta 1 in guinea pig brain membrane,"Title: Opioid agonist and antagonist bivalent ligands. The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753852,20181010,14845809|15819291|46877852|101880775|118718754|118718755|118718757|118718758|118718759|118718760|118718762|118718763|118718764|118718765,103734706|103735028|312365623|312365624|312365625|312365626|312365628|312365629|312365630|312365631|312365633|312365634|312365635|312365636,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The compounds were biased toward opioid receptor antagonist activity by incorporating (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (a potent, nonselective opioid pure antagonist) as one of the monomers. The other two monomers, which included N-substituted or unsubstituted Boc-protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity. Screening of these compounds in competitive binding experiments with the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [3H]U69,593 led to the discovery of a novel kappa opioid receptor selective ligand, N-¿(2'S)-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamido]-3'-methylbutyl¿-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (8, RTI-5989-29). Additional structure-activity relationship studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen-bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. These sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-fold increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu-selective ligand, (+)-N-[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a). The degree of selectivity observed in the radioligand binding experiments was not observed in the functional assay. According to its ability to inhibit agonist stimulated binding of [35S]GTPgammaS at all three opioid receptors, compound 8 behaves as a mu/kappa opioid receptor pure antagonist with negligible affinity for the delta receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755202,20200704,5360515|5480230|9804952|44365777,103171149|103394215|103698780|131283791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9857089,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The corresponding acetamide derivatives (5-7) also were synthesized to serve as nonelectrophilic controls. The o- and p-isothiocyanates (2 and 4) and the haloamides (8-11) were selective delta opioid receptor antagonists in the mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, while the meta isomer 3 was a delta-selective full agonist (IC50 = 5 nM). The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component. The m-isothiocyanate 3 was found to be a delta-selective and irreversible agonist in the MVD, and it is suggested that it may be covalently binding to an agonist recognition site. In the mouse abdominal stretch antinociceptive assay, compounds 2-4 and 9 were delta-selective antagonists but exhibited delta 2/delta 1 selectivity ratios than that of BNTI.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755439,20181015,44276213|44276269|44276292|44276293,103196586|103196719|103196790|103196791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7731019,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The nor compounds (4 and 6) and the phenethyl derivatives (5 and 8) displayed full agonist activity (IC50 = 85-179 nM) in the mouse vas deferens preparation (MVD) while the other members of the series exhibited partial agonist or weak antagonist activity. In the guinea pig ileum preparation (GPI), all compounds except 8 were partial agonists. The ligands that were evaluated in mice were found to produce antinociception that was not selectively mediated via delta opioid receptors. However, two of these ligands (4 and 5) appeared to be delta-selective opioid receptor antagonists at subthreshold doses for antinociception. The finding that all of the compounds bind selectively to delta opioid receptors in guinea pig brain membranes together with the in vitro pharmacology and in vivo antagonist studies suggests that the lack of delta agonist selectivity in vivo may be due to a number of factors, including a basic difference between the delta receptor system in the MVD and in the mouse brain.

All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756033,20181015,5497186|44353390|44353391|44353454|44353457|44353458|44353468,103365942|103365943|103366138|103366152|103366153|103366185|103697951,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding. However, a relationship involving the hydrophobic character of the N-substituent is discussed. The N-(2-fluoroethyl) derivatives in both series were found to cause convulsions in rats at doses of 40-45 mg/kg ip.

Rearrangement of 3 (NaOMe) afforded 5,14-exo-(phenyloxyamino)thebainone and derivatives (4a-d); reduction of 3 led to 14-(phenylamino)dihydrocodeinone and derivatives (5a-d). Thebaine also reacted with 1-halo-1-nitrosocyclohexane (halo = Cl, Br) and with benzohydroxamic acid under oxidizing conditions to give 14-(hydroxyamino)codeinone (6). All compounds, 3-6, were evaluated as analgetics and antagonists by the tail-flick, writhing, and Straub tail assays: compounds of types 3-5 were analgetics (N-Me), one-third to one-tenth as potent as morphine, or antagonists [N-(cyclopropylmethyl)], 50 to 100 times less potent than naloxone; 6 behaved as an antagonist in the tail-flick test but as an agonist in the other assays.

Opioid affinity (mu, kappa, and delta for selected compounds) and opioid antagonist activity (mu and kappa) were characterized and compared to effects on food consumption.

New analogs._||_Abstract: We have designed and synthesized several cyclic disulfide-containing peptide analogs of dynorphin A (Dyn A) which are conformationally constrained in the putative 'address' segment of the opioid ligand. Several of these Dyn A analogs exhibit unexpected apparent selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogs has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [L-Pen5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (4), [Cys5,Cys10]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (5), [Cys5,Cys9]DynA1-11-NH2 (6), and [Cys4,Cys9,Arg10]DynA1-11-NH2(7). All of these analogs possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities for the central receptor (guinea pig brain), but effect only weak potency at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (GPI). In fact cyclic dynorphin A analog 4 shows > 19,000-fold differences between central kappa opioid affinity and potency in the guinea pig ileum (GPI). Additionally analog 4 is not an antagonist in the GPI, suggesting possible receptor differences between these sites. Substitution of Tyr1 by Phe1 in the cyclic 1-11 series gave the analog [Phe1,Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) that was surprisingly potent in the guinea pig brain binding assay (IC50 = 15.1 nM) at the kappa receptor, but was inactive in the GPI and mouse vas deferens bioassays. D-Ala2 and Tic4 analogs of 1 had lower affinity at brain kappa receptors and had very weak potencies in the GPI and MVD bioassays. On the other hand, [Cys6,Cys10]DynA1-11-NH2 (8), [Cys8,D-Cys13]DynA1-13-NH2 (9), [D-Cys8,D-Cys12]DynA1-13-NH2 (10), and [D-Pro10,Cys5,Cys13]-Dyn A1-13-NH2 (11) were surprisingly potent in the GPI bioassay, though considerable apparent selectivity for central receptors is still retained.

226077,Literature-derived,Potency against opioid receptor relative to morphine,"Title: Opioid agonist and antagonist activities of peripherally selective derivatives of naltrexamine and oxymorphamine._||_Abstract: A series of beta-naltrexamine and beta-oxymorphamine derivatives that contain ionizable moieties coupled to the 6 beta-amino group were synthesized in an effort to develop antagonists and agonists that have negligible access into the central nervous system (CNS). Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS. Such ligands may be useful pharmacologic tools for investigation of peripheral opioid mechanisms. Moreover, they could find clinical applications when the central actions are unwanted.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL845234,20200628,13894004,163333212,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2475628,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0
227055,Literature-derived,Competitive inhibition of the DADLE on mouse vas deferens for the opioid receptor delta at 100 nM,"Title: Role of spacer and address components in peptidomimetic delta opioid receptor antagonists related to naltrindole._||_Abstract: A series of heterocyclic analogues 2-5 related to naltrindole (1) (NTI) and 6-arylnaltrexone derivatives 6-8 were synthesized in order to determine the role of the spacer and the address moieties in conferring delta opioid receptor antagonist activity. The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component.

227059,Literature-derived,Delta opioid activity on Mouse vas deference using DADLE as standard,Title: Opioid antagonist activity of naltrexone-derived bivalent ligands: importance of a properly oriented molecular scaffold to guide 'address' recognition at kappa opioid receptors._||_Abstract: The presence of a molecular scaffold to orient a basic group is important for potent and selective kappa opioid antagonist selectivity. An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844975,20200704,5360515|44297100|44297115|44297187|44297188|44297189|44297194|44297195,103238133|103238166|103238420|103238421|103238422|103238444|103238445|131283791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu).

All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852828,20200703,44353390|44353391|44353454|44353457|44353458|44353468,103365942|103365943|103366138|103366152|103366153|103366185,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The corresponding acetamide derivatives (5-7) also were synthesized to serve as nonelectrophilic controls. The o- and p-isothiocyanates (2 and 4) and the haloamides (8-11) were selective delta opioid receptor antagonists in the mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, while the meta isomer 3 was a delta-selective full agonist (IC50 = 5 nM). The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component. The m-isothiocyanate 3 was found to be a delta-selective and irreversible agonist in the MVD, and it is suggested that it may be covalently binding to an agonist recognition site.

Compounds 4-16 were evaluated for their affinities in opioid receptor binding assays in rat or guinea pig brain membranes and for their opioid antagonist and agonist activities in vitro on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. All of the compounds displayed delta selectivity in binding to the delta, mu, and kappa opioid receptors. The binding potencies of most of the compounds at the delta, mu, and kappa sites, however, were lower than that of 1. Among positional isomers, the 7'-substituted compounds in general had higher affinities than 6'-, 5'-, or 4'-substituted analogues, indicating that bulky groups are tolerated better at the 7'-position than at other positions. The affinity of the compounds were also determined at putative subtypes of the delta and kappa receptors: deltacx-1 (mu-like), deltacx-2 (delta-like), and the kappa2b site in an attempt to identify subtype selective agents. Although none were identified, the data revealed a different rank-order of potency beteween mu vs deltacx-1, deltacx-2 vs delta, and the kappa2b vs mu, delta, and kappa1. The antagonist potencies of the compounds in the MVD were in agreement with their binding affinities at the delta site in rat brain membrane. The most potent member of the series, the 7'-phenoxy compound 14, binds to the delta site with a Ki of 0.71 nM, shows >40-fold delta over mu and delta over kappa binding selectivity, and exhibits delta receptor antagonist potency in the MVD with a Ke of 0.25 nM, properties which are comparable to the delta receptor affinity and antagonist potency of naltrindole (Ki = 0.29 nM, Ke = 0. 49 nM). Interestingly, many members of the series were found to possess significant partial to full agonist activities in the MVD (6, 9, 10, 13, 16) or GPI (6, 11, 14, 15). Among the compounds studied, the highest agonist activity in the MVD was displayed by 16 (IC50 = 220 nM), and the highest agonist activity in the GPI was displayed by 14 (IC50 = 450 nM). The overall affinity and activity profile of compound 14 is, therefore, that of a nonpeptide ligand possessing mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist properties. Recently there has been considerable interest in such compounds possessing mu agonist/delta antagonist activities because of their potential therapeutic usefulness as analgesics with low propensity to produce tolerance and dependence side effects. The results of the present study suggest that morphinan derivatives related to 16 and 14 may provide useful leads for the development of potent nonpeptide ligands possessing delta agonist or mixed delta antagonist/mu agonist activities.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL841115,20200704,5497186|44329399|44329448|44329452|44329460|44329469|44329553,103311925|103312035|103312041|103312058|103312071|103312228|103697951,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9667975,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Piperazine 10 is a 5-HT(1A) agonist with an EC(50) comparable to serotonin, based on cAMP formation and GTP(gamma)S binding assays. Radiosynthesis of [(11)C]10 has been achieved by reacting 2-{4-[4-(7-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (9) and [(11)C]CH(3)OTf in 25 +/- 5% (n = 15) yield at the end of synthesis (EOS). The chemical and radiochemical purities of [(11)C]10 were >99% with a specific activity 1500 +/- 300 Ci/mmol (n =15). PET studies in anesthetized baboon demonstrate [(11)C]10 specific binding in brain regions rich in 5-HT(1A) receptors. Binding of [(11)C]10 was blocked by WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT. The regional brain volumes of distribution (V(T)) of [(11)C]10 in baboon correlate with [(11)C]WAY100635 V(T) in baboons.

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3. One of the active constrained analogues, compound 4, exhibited subnanomolar mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.62 nM) and potent mu-opioid antagonist activity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM). On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed. In these compounds the octahydroquinolizine template of 4 was replaced by an octahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine scaffold. The new derivatives were tested for their binding affinities and in vitro functional activity against the cloned human mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. From this study, we identified compound 36, which displays high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.47 nM), potent mu in vitro antagonist activity (IC(50) = 1.8 nM) and improved binding selectivity profile mu/kappa and mu/delta, when compared to 4.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909297,20181021,16094376|16094377|16094378|16094379|16094380|16094381|16094382|16094393|16094396|16094409|16094411|16094412|16094422|16094427|16094431,103503646|103503647|103503650|103503651|103503652|103503653|103503654|103503658|103503659|103503663|103503676|103503702|103503703|103503708|103503717,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149859,0,,P41143,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

In this concept, the bifunctional peptides were expected to interact with each receptor separately in the spinal dorsal horn where both the opioid receptors and the NK1 receptors were found to be expressed, to show an enhanced analgesic effect, no opioid-induced tolerance, and to provide better compliance than coadministration of two drugs. Compounds were synthesized using a two-step combinatorial method for C-terminal modification. In the method, the protected C-terminal-free carboxyl peptide, Boc-Tyr( tBu)- d-Ala-Gly Phe-Pro-Leu-Trp(Boc)-OH, was synthesized as a shared intermediate using Fmoc solid phase chemistry on a 2-chlorotrityl resin. This intermediate was esterified or amidated in solution phase. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) showed that the C-terminus acted as not only a critical pharmacophore for the substance P antagonist activities, but as an address region for the opioid agonist pharmacophore that is structurally distant from the C-terminal. Among the peptides, H-Tyr- d -Ala-Gly-Phe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bzl ( 3) demonstrated high binding affinities at both delta and mu receptors ( K i = 10 and 0.65 nM, respectively) with efficient agonist functional activity in the mouse isolated vas deferens (MVD) and guinea pig isolated ileum (GPI) assays (IC 50 = 50 and 13 nM, respectively). Compound 3 also showed a good antagonist activity in the GPI assay with substance P stimulation ( K e = 26 nM) and good affinity for the hNK1 receptor ( K i = 14 nM).

A variety of novel piperidine MDL 100907 derivatives, possible to label with (18)F-fluorine, were synthesized to improve molecular imaging properties of [(11)C]MDL 100907. Their in vitro affinities to a broad spectrum of neuroreceptors and their lipophilicities were determined and compared to the clinically used reference compounds MDL 100907 and altanserin. The novel compounds MA-1 (53) and (R)-MH.MZ (56) show K(i)-values in the nanomolar range towards the 5-HT(2A) receptor and insignificant binding to other 5-HT receptor subtypes or receptors. Interestingly, compounds MA-1 (53), MH.MZ (55) and (R)-MH.MZ (56) provide a receptor selectivity profile similar to MDL 100907. These compounds could possibly be preferable antagonistic (18)F-tracers for visualization of the 5-HT(2A) receptor status. Medium affine compounds (VK-1 (32), (51), (52), (54)) were synthesized and have K(i) values between 30 and 120 nM. All promising compounds show logP values between 2 and 3, that is, within the range of those for the established radiotracers altanserin and MDL 100907.

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR.

Bifunctional compounds, possessing both the NK1 antagonist pharmacophore and the opioid agonist pharmacophore with delta-selectivity, could counteract these system changes to have significant analgesic efficacy without undesirable side effects.

The NMR structural analysis of 2 revealed that the relative positioning of the two connected pharmacophores as well as its cyclic and topological constraints might be responsible for its excellent bifunctional activities as well as its significant delta-opioid selectivity.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1763212,20200629,5311340|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915143|52915144|52915145|52915146|52915147|52915266|52915267|52915268|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916174|52916266|52916267|52916358|52916359|52916360|52916470|52916471|52916472|52916597|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|131271836|131271837|131271838|131271839|131271840|131271841|131273789|131273790|131275837|131275838|131275839|131275840|131275841|131277781|131277782|131277783|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277787|131277788|131277789|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281857|131281858|131281859|131281860|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283861|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131285841|131285842|131287148,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,,P41143,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

To improve their biological activities and metabolic stability, structural optimization was performed on our peptide-derived lead compounds by introducing 2',6'-dimethyl-L-tyrosine (Dmt) instead of Tyr at the first position. The compound 7 (Dmt-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-Met-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-[3',5'-(CF(3))(2)-Bzl]) showed improved multivalent bioactivities compared to those of the lead compounds, had more than 6 h half-life in rat plasma, and had significant antinociceptive efficacy in vivo. The NMR structural analysis suggested that Dmt(1) incorporation in compound 7 induces the structured conformation in the opioid pharmacophore (N-terminus) and simultaneously shifts the orientation of the NK1 pharmacophore (C-terminus), consistent with its affinities and activities at both opioid and NK1 receptors.

A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity.

In this series, the affinity and functional activity of the ligands were found to be influenced by the nature of the substituent at C-14 as well as by the substituent at N-17. Whereas the incorporation of a 3-phenylpropoxy group at C-14 on N-methylpyridomorhinan gave a dual MOR agonist/DOR agonist 17h, its incorporation on N-cyclopropylmethylpyridomorphinan gave a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist 17d. Interestingly, 17d, in contrast to 17h, did not produce tolerance or dependence effects upon prolonged treatment in cells expressing MOR and DOR. Moreover, 17d displayed greatly diminished analgesic tolerance as compared to morphine upon repeated administration, thus supporting the hypothesis that ligands with MOR agonist/DOR antagonist functional activity could emerge as novel analgesics devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2187198,20200625,9805452|11190061,103734664|103734938,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23016952,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However, a variety of adverse effects were associated with them, partially due to their relatively low MOR selectivity. NAP, a 6β-N-4'-pyridyl substituted naltrexamine derivative, was identified previously as a potent and highly selective MOR antagonist mainly acting within the peripheral nervous system. The noticeable diarrhea associated with it prompted the design and synthesis of its analogues in order to study its structure-activity relationship. Among them, compound 8 showed improved pharmacological profiles compared to the original lead, acting mainly at peripheral while increasing the intestinal motility in morphine-pelleted mice (ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg). The slight decrease of the ED(50) compared to the original lead was well compensated by the unobserved adverse effect.

They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents.

754475,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to delta opioid receptor (unknown origin),"Title: Orally active opioid compounds from a non-poppy source._||_Abstract: The basic science and clinical use of morphine and other 'opioid' drugs are based almost exclusively on the extracts or analogues of compounds isolated from a single source, the opium poppy (Papaver somniferum). However, it now appears that biological diversity has evolved an alternative source. Specifically, at least two alkaloids isolated from the plant Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine ((E)-2-[(2S,3S)-3-ethyl-8-methoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b-octahydroindolo[3,2-h]quinolizin-2-yl]-3-methoxyprop-2-enoic acid methyl ester; 9-methoxy coryantheidine; MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG), and several synthetic analogues of these natural products display centrally mediated (supraspinal and spinal) antinociceptive (analgesic) activity in various pain models. Several characteristics of these compounds suggest a classic 'opioid' mechanism of action: nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors, competitive interaction with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, and two-way analgesic cross-tolerance with morphine. However, other characteristics of the compounds suggest novelty, particularly chemical structure and possible greater separation from side effects. We review the chemical and pharmacological properties of these compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399172,20180927,44301701,103248656,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23517479,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The first-generation ligands appeared to be MOR-selective, whereas the second and the third generation ones showed MOR/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) dual selectivity. Docking of ligands 2 (MOR selective) and 10 (MOR/KOR dual selective) to the three opioid receptor crystal structures revealed a nonconserved-residue-facilitated hydrogen-bonding network that could be responsible for their distinctive selectivity profiles. The MOR/KOR dual-selective ligand 10 showed no agonism and acted as a potent antagonist in the tail-flick assay. It also produced less severe opioid withdrawal symptoms than naloxone in morphine-dependent mice. In conclusion, ligand 10 may serve as a novel lead compound to develop MOR/KOR dual-selective ligands, which might possess unique therapeutic value for opioid addiction treatment.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3089527,20180928,5360515|76309826|76309827|76309828|76313542|76313543|76313544|76317053|76317054|76317055|76317056|76317057|76320762|76327982|76331634|76331635|76331636|76335253|76335254|76335255,131283791|194138077|194138078|194138079|194144969|194144970|194144971|194151804|194151805|194151806|194151807|194151808|194158776|194172609|194179436|194179437|194179438|194186277|194186278|194186279,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24144240,0,,P41143,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates.

An N-allyl substituent in the C4a phenylpropyl series induced 6-fold higher affinity at δ-than μ-receptors, while an N-CPM substituent in the C4a (CH2)3Ph series led to a compound with high δ-affinity and potent δ-antagonist activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3413014,20200625,105104|5288826|5462471|118731405|118731406|118731407|118731408|118731409|118731410|118731411|118731412|118731413|118731414|118731415|118731416|118731417|118731418|118731419|118731420|118731421|118731422|118731423|118731424|118731425|118731426|118731427|118731428,103169185|103177815|103217856|312385427|312385428|312385429|312385430|312385431|312385432|312385433|312385434|312385435|312385436|312385437|312385438|312385439|312385440|312385441|312385442|312385443|312385444|312385445|312385446|312385447|312385448|312385449|312385450,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25599950,0,,P41143,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These multifunctional ligands were designed to interact with the multiple receptors to show an enhanced analgesic effect, with no opioid-induced tolerance. We designed our multifunctional ligands based on the well-known second generation bradykinin 2 receptor antagonist Hoe 140 (DArg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-DTic-Oic-Arg-OH) and the opioid enkephalin analogues Tyr-DAla-Phe, Tyr-DAla-Gly-Phe and Tyr-Pro-Phe. We explored the conjugation of opioid pharmacophore to the Hoe 140 (DArg-Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Thi-Ser-DTic-Oic-Arg-OH) in various positions with and without a linker. These bifunctional ligands showed very good binding affinity towards the both μ and δ opioid receptors. Among these bifunctional ligands 8, 11 and 12 showed excellent and balanced binding affinity at both μ and δ opioid receptors (0.5 nM, 2.0 nM; 0.3 nM, 2 nM; 2 nM and 3 nM), respectively. On the other hand these bifunctional ligands showed very weak and no binding affinity for rat brain bradykinin 2 receptors. Similarly, the Hoe 140 showed very low affinity (>10,000 nM and 9,000 nM) against [(3)H] BK binding in rat brain membranes and in HEK293 cells, respectively. In contrast, the Hoe 140 showed very good binding affinity in guinea pig ileum (0.43 nM) similar to that of previously reported. The bradykinin 2 receptors are known to be present in rat brain membrane, guinea pig ileum (GPI) and rabbit jugular vein. Previously the binding affinity of Hoe 140 for bradykinin 2 receptor was reported using guinea pig ileum. The above results suggest that the bradykinin 2 receptors present in rat brain membrane are a different sub type than the bradykinin 2 receptor present in guinea pig ileum (GPI).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3619868,20200624,122189854|122189855|122189856|122189857|122189858|122189859|122189860|122189861|122189862|122189863|122189901,318389035|318389036|318389037|318389038|318389039|318389040|318389041|318389042|318389043|318389044|318389100,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26316468,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds.

Molecular docking studies suggest that the 'message' part of (-)-6j interacts with residue Asp128(3.32) and a neighboring water molecule, and the 'address' part of (-)-6j packs with hydrophobic residues Leu300(7.35), Val281(6.55), and Trp284(6.58), rendering DOR selectivity.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed. Compounds with a phenolic 4-hydroxy group do not form the hydrogen bond with His291, an important residue for KOP affinity and agonist activity. The size of the N-substituent hosted by the hydrophobic pocket formed by Val108, Ile316 and Tyr320 considerably influences binding and selectivity, with the n-alkyl size limit being five carbon atoms, while bulky substituents turn KOP agonists in antagonists. Thus, combination of experimental and molecular modeling strategies provides an initial framework for understanding the structural features of diphenethylamines that are essential to promote binding affinity and selectivity for the KOP receptor, and may be involved in transduction of the ligand binding event into molecular changes, ultimately leading to receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3858680,20200624,122589952|134139387|134147031,374283991|374295165|374322756,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27567368,0,,P41143,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We have explored the structure-activity relationship of a 3-(4-phenyl-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5-(aryl)benzoic acid antagonist scaffold, assisted by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a P2Y14R homology model. A computational pipeline using the High Throughput MD Python environment guided the analogue design. Selection of candidates was based upon ligand-protein shape and complementarity and the persistence of ligand-protein interactions over time. Predictions of a favorable substitution of a 5-phenyl group with thiophene and an insertion of a three-methylene spacer between the 5-aromatic and alkyl amino moieties were largely consistent with empirical results. The substitution of a key carboxylate group on the core phenyl ring with tetrazole or truncation of the 5-aryl group reduced affinity. The most potent antagonists, using a fluorescent assay, were a primary 3-aminopropyl congener 20 (MRS4458) and phenyl p-carboxamide 30 (MRS4478).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4189952,20200618,134611895|145966170|145972038,404674324|404676342|404684946,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767967,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

According to the pharmacological results, the functional reversal observed in orvinol analogues by introduction of 7β-methyl substituent could not be reproduced in nepenthone analogues. Alternatively, introduction of 7β-methyl substituent was associated with substantial loss of both subtype selectivity and potency but not efficacy for nepenthone analogues, which was not found in 7β-methyl orvinol analogues. Surprisingly, SLL-603, a 7β-methyl analogue of SLL-020ACP, was identified to be a KOR full agonist. The possible molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity in activity cliff was also investigated. In conclusion, 7β-methyl substituent was a structural locus associated with activity cliff and demonstrated as a pharmacological heterogeneity between nepenthone and orvinol analogues that warrants further investigations.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4234965,20200619,118200491|118200640|134227139|145982510|145982515|145982585|145982792|145982828|145982968|145983526|145983969|145984022|145984192|145984332|145984702|145984984|145986165,404700896|404700902|404701000|404701302|404701354|404701555|404702330|404702946|404703021|404703256|404703400|404703467|404703987|404704355|404704805|404704854|404706051,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30054192,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Modification of the 17-amino side chain of the opioid ligand to an arylsulfonyl group and the 6-furan acrylamide chain to 2-pyridyl acrylamide led to compound 71 with improvement of the antagonist activity (OX1R, Ki = 1.36 nM; OX2R, not active) without any detectable affinity for the opioid receptor. The dihydrosulfate salt of 71, freely soluble in water, attenuated the physical dependence of morphine. Furthermore, all of the active nalfurafine derivatives in this study had almost no activity for OX2R, which led to high OX1R selectivity. These results suggest that nalfurafine derivatives could be a useful series of lead compounds to develop highly selective OX1R antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3993334,20200620,6918287|11180190|129093829|135314564|137632260|137641318|137645329|137661045|137662177,103646514|381837823|381845455|381847437|381851387|381857181|381857293|381886019|381887684,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28051300,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Indeed, dextro enantiomers bind with high affinity σ1 receptor while opposite enantiomers bind opioid receptors. In spite of their stereochemistry, cis-N-2-phenylethyl N-normetazocine (phenazocine) enantiomers showed mixed opioid/σ1 receptor profiles and a significant in vivo analgesia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available regarding the evaluation of σ1 pharmacological profile in the antinociceptive effects of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine. Therefore, the present study was designed to ascertain this component by in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, we tested the σ1 affinity of both enantiomers by a predictive binding assay in absence or presence of phenytoin (DPH). Our results showed that DPH (1 mM) did not increase the σ1 receptor affinity of (+)-and (-)-phenazocine (Ki = 3.8 ± 0.4 nM, Ki = 85 ± 2.0 nM, respectively) suggesting a σ1 antagonist profile of both enantiomers. This σ1 antagonistic component of two phenazocine enantiomers was corroborated by in vivo studies in which the selective σ1 receptor agonist PRE-084, was able to unmask their σ1 antagonistic component associated with the opioid activity. The σ1 antagonistic component of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine may justify their analgesic activity and it suggests that they may constitute useful lead compounds to develop new ligands with this dual activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4000649,20200620,11314197,136933674,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27721146,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or 99mTc for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) or the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEK cells transfected with μ (HEK-mu) or δ (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity. These conjugates were abandoned from further development but information about their synthesis may be valuable to other laboratories working in this field.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4014927,20200620,137647247,381860123,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28291693,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

Contrary to the classical monomeric model, indirect evidence suggests that ORs might form dimers, which could be endowed with a distinct pharmacological profile, and, thus, be targeted to develop innovative pharmacological therapies. However, direct evidence for the spontaneous formation of OR dimers in living cells under physiological conditions is missing. Despite a growing interest in the κ opioid receptor (KOR), KOR-selective fluorescent probes are particularly scarce in the literature. Herein, we present the first set of fluorescent KOR-selective probes with antagonistic properties. Two of these were employed in single-molecule microscopy (SMM) experiments to investigate KOR homodimerization, localization, and trafficking.

A computational pipeline suggested alternatives to naphthalene of a previously reported P2Y14R antagonist (3, PPTN) using docking and molecular dynamics simulations on a hP2Y14R homology model based on P2Y12R structures. By reevaluating the binding of 3 to P2Y14R computationally, two alternatives, i.e., alkynyl and triazolyl derivatives, were identified. Improved synthesis of fluorescent antagonist 4 enabled affinity quantification (IC50s, nM) using flow cytometry of P2Y14R-expressing CHO cells. p-F3C-phenyl-triazole 65 (32) was more potent than a corresponding alkyne 11. Thus, additional triazolyl derivatives were prepared, as guided by docking simulations, with nonpolar aryl substituents favored. Although triazoles were less potent than 3 (6), simpler synthesis facilitated further structural optimization.

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL690226,20181010,118718761,312365632,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component. The m-isothiocyanate 3 was found to be a delta-selective and irreversible agonist in the MVD, and it is suggested that it may be covalently binding to an agonist recognition site.

In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic. The unique structural features of JDTic will make this compound highly useful in further characterization of the kappa receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751976,20181017,5480230|11016305|11091606,103171086|103698780|103698799,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12825951,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752129,20181016,5480230|44306867|44324324|44324339|44324361|44324362,103259212|103300947|103301007|103301050|103301051|103698780,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,,P41143,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

149192,Confirmatory,Binding affinity was measured by the displacement of [3H]- DADLE in guinea pig brain membrane of opioid receptor delta,"Title: Design of peptidomimetic delta opioid receptor antagonists using the message-address concept._||_Abstract: Highly selective nonpeptide ligands with potent delta opioid receptor antagonist activity have been developed using the message-address concept. This approach envisaged the delta opioid receptor to contain two major recognition subsites; a message subsite which recognizes the pharmacophore, and an address subsite that is unique for the delta receptor type and confers selectivity. The message and address components of the delta-selective enkephalins were postulated to be Tyr1 and Phe4, respectively, with Gly2-Gly3 functioning as a spacer. The message component of the target compounds in this study was derived from naltrexone and related structures. An indole system was fused to the C ring of naltrexone as a mimic of the address component. The benzene moiety of indole was viewed as the delta address component, mimicking the phenyl group of Phe4, and the pyrrole portion was used as a rigid spacer. Members of the series (1-23) were evaluated for opioid antagonist activity on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. Naltrindole (NTI, 1) was the most potent member of the series, with Ke values of approximately 0.1 nM at delta receptors. The antagonism by NTI was approximately 220- and 350-fold greater at delta than at mu and kappa opioid receptors. The binding of NTI and selected members of the series to guinea pig brain membranes was qualitatively consistent with their pharmacologic antagonist activity profiles in the MVD and GPI, but the Ki values were not in the same rank order. The selectivity of NTI arises mainly as a consequence of increased affinity at delta receptors. Thus, the Ke and Ki values of NTI were 1/530 and 1/90 that of the delta antagonist enkephalin analogue, ICI 174864. In contrast to NTI, ICI174864 derives its selectivity through greatly decreased recognition at mu and kappa receptors. The implications of the high affinity and selectivity of NTI as a consequence of its conformational rigidity are discussed. It is suggested that any attempt to model a receptor-bound conformation of an opioid peptide should consider affinity and potency at multiple receptor sites rather than selectivity alone.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757336,20181012,5360515|5362396|5491897|5497186|44149909|44292854|44578135|46877619|46877621|46877624|46877629|46877643|46877816|73348734,103229769|103230026|103553488|103623353|103623354|103697951|103734670|103734672|103734678|103734685|103734703|103734987|131283791|174495355,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2160538,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Chromatography of the mixture resulted in conversion of the bulk of the thiol 9 to the disulfide 13 by air oxidation. The disulfide 13 was also prepared by condensing the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether of 4 with the dithiodiglycolyl chloride and treating the resulting product with F- to give the desired product. The pure thiol 9 free of contamination with the disulfide was prepared by treating 13 with excess N-acetyl-L-cysteine and processing the reaction mixture without resorting to chromatography for purification. The corresponding N-(cyclopropylmethyl) nor compound 15 was prepared from the silyl ether 6 and acetylthioglycolyl chloride followed by hydrolysis, treatment with F-, and air oxidation.

Opioid receptor affinity studies have revealed the virtual absence of enantioselectivity for receptor binding, particularly at the mu-receptor, for the (+)-3a-f and the (-)-3a-f series. It is noteworthy that inversion of configuration at the nitrogen-bearing carbon atom [5S,8S,9S)-8-amino-3-hydroxy-5, 9-methano-9-(methoxymethyl)-5-methylbenzocyclooctene, (+)-3a vs (5S,8S,9R)-8-amino-3-hydroxy-5, 9-methano-9-(methoxymethyl)-5-methylbenzocyclooctene, (dl)-22] resulted in a > 10-fold increase in kappa-receptor affinity. Antinociceptive studies demonstrated that (dl)-22 was a full kappa-agonist while (+)-3a and (-)-3a did not possess kappa-activity.

The peptidic analogues were synthesized by solid phase techniques using a Fmoc/tert-butyl strategy, and the psi(CH2-NH) bond, or reduced bond, was introduced via reductive alkylation of the N-terminal amino group of the growing peptide with a Fmoc-N(alpha)-protected amino aldehyde. The synthesis of Fmoc-N(alpha)-protected amino aldehydes also is described. Several other peptides have been previously synthesized incorporating this modification and showed for instance increased enzymatic stability and antagonist properties. Results obtained in the GPB show that modifications of the peptide bond in the address site (analogues 4-9) do not affect the binding at the kappa receptor and, with a few exceptions, at the mu and delta receptors. On the other hand, analogues 2 and 3, modified in the message segment of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2, show a decrease in binding affinity at all three receptors. In the GPI, the results are more varied as the influence of the peptide bond modification seems to be more important than in the GPB.

In smooth muscle preparations, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the affinity labels 3-6 behaved as kappa agonists in that they were potently antagonized by norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). In addition to the high binding affinity and selectivity of the 3-isothiocyanate 3 (DIPPA) to kappa opioid receptors, wash studies have suggested that this involves covalent binding. In the mouse tail-flick assay, the 3- and 4-substituted isomers (3 and 5, respectively) produced long-lasting antagonism of the antinociceptive effect of the kappa opioid agonist, (+/-)-trans-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]acetamide ((+/-)-U50,488). In contrast, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the fumaramate derivative 4 were devoid of antagonist activity in the tail-flick assay. At substantially different doses, DIPPA (3) and the 4-isothiocyanate 5 also produced antinociception in the mouse abdominal stretch assay. In addition, DIPPA and the 3-fumaramate methyl ester 4 had improved in vivo kappa-selectivities compared to the unsubstituted parent compound (+)-S-2 and the para-substituted derivative 5. The improved kappa-selectivities of 3 and 4 and the different agonist and antagonist potencies of 3 and 5 may be explained respectively by the existence of multiple kappa agonist binding sites and distinct agonist and antagonist binding sites. In view of the antagonist selectivity and the apparent irreversible binding of DIPPA to kappa receptors, it may serve as a useful pharmacologic or biochemical tool to investigate kappa opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749997,20181014,10456060,103230742,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7799399,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Peptides extended at the C-terminus with residues which can be used as handles for further modification and/or labeling (i.e. Asx, Glx, and Lys) were synthesized. The TIPP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives exhibited similar delta-receptor affinity to TIPP (K(i) = 5-10 nM vs K(i) = 6 nM), and neither the location of the carboxylic acid moiety nor the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue significantly affected the delta-receptor affinity of these derivatives. Extension of TIPP with an additional residue did not increase mu-receptor affinity, even though the position of the acidic group, which imparts delta-receptor selectivity to TIPP, was shifted relative to the carboxylic acid moiety of TIPP. The delta-receptor affinities of the TIP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives were found to be influenced mainly by the position of the carboxylic acid function rather than the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue. TIP(P)-D/L-Lys(Ac)-OH derivatives exhibited moderate delta-receptor affinity (K(i)(delta) = 16-28 nM). The most potent compounds found in the extended TIP(P) series were TIPP-D-Gln-OH and TIP-D-Gln-OH (K(i)(delta) = 5 nM) which had similar affinities to TIPP.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751671,20181016,644210|10077545|10440134|10557001|10651237|10651238|10651452|10675111|10676537|10722490|10747714|10771425|10818843|10818935|10841295|10841482|11803174|12093958|73350137|73354619|118719100,103463433|174485071|174495129|174500373|174500374|174500375|174500376|174500377|174500378|174505473|174510682|174510684|174510685|174515846|174515847|174515848|174520934|174520935|174520936|174520937|312366212,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11150177,0,,P41143,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

GTP-gamma-S functional assays showed 13 to be a selective delta antagonist, albeit with lower potency than naltrindole. Although the reason for the unique profile of 13 could not be determined, these results validate our approach of introducing groups into the indolomorphinans that are known to reduce mu activity, to obtain increased delta selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756214,20181016,5497186,103697951,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10229636,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance. These results indicate that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan templates could provide ligands with mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist profiles and such ligands may have the potential of emerging as novel analgesic drugs devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756218,20181018,123924,103175041,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14998329,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Both 2 and 3 were found to be selective kappa opioid receptor antagonists in smooth muscle preparations, and they bound selectively to kappa-recognition sites. The thiophene analogue 2 displayed binding selectivity that was of the same order of magnitude as that of 1a, while 3 was considerably less selective for kappa site. This is consistent with the fact that the second pharmacophore in 1a and 2 displayed a greater degree of superposition than 1a and 3. The results of this study suggest that the pyrrole moiety of norBNI functions primarily as an inert spacer to rigidly hold the basic nitrogen in the second pharmacophore at an 'address' subsite that is unique for the kappa opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753662,20181013,5480230|5484197|46877614,103698780|103734657|103734658,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1849995,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

All the title compounds were devoid of significant affinity for both CCK-A and CCK-B receptors, while some of them bound with nanomolar affinity and high selectivity for kappa-opioid receptors. In particular, the 2-thienyl derivative 7A(X = H) with a K(i) = 0.50 nM represents a clear improvement with respect to tifluadom, showing a comparable potency but higher selectivity.

The compounds were biased toward opioid receptor antagonist activity by incorporating (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (a potent, nonselective opioid pure antagonist) as one of the monomers. The other two monomers, which included N-substituted or unsubstituted Boc-protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity. Screening of these compounds in competitive binding experiments with the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [3H]U69,593 led to the discovery of a novel kappa opioid receptor selective ligand, N-¿(2'S)-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamido]-3'-methylbutyl¿-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (8, RTI-5989-29). Additional structure-activity relationship studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen-bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. These sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-fold increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu-selective ligand, (+)-N-[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a). The degree of selectivity observed in the radioligand binding experiments was not observed in the functional assay.

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754169,20181015,5360515,131283791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Recent evidence suggests that agonists acting at kappa opioid receptors may modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons and alter the neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine.

Binding experiments demonstrated that the cyclobutyl analogue 3b [(-)-3-hydroxy-N-cyclobutylmethylmorphinan S(+)-mandelate, 3b, MCL-101] of cyclorphan (3a) had a high affinity for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors in guinea pig brain membranes. Both 3a,b were approximately 2-fold more selective for the kappa receptor than for the mu receptor. However 3b (the cyclobutyl analogue) was 18-fold more selective for the kappa receptor in comparison to the delta receptor, while cyclorphan (3a) had only 4-fold greater affinity for the kappa receptor in comparison to the delta receptor. These findings were confirmed in the antinociceptive tests (tail-flick and acetic acid writhing) in mice, which demonstrated that cyclorphan (3a) produced antinociception that was mediated by the delta receptor while 3b did not produce agonist or antagonist effects at the delta receptor.

The corresponding Z-isomer 1b was not readily available through direct aldol condensation of naltrexone (6) with benzaldehyde. Using the photochemical methods employed by Lewis to isomerize cinnamamides, we have obtained Z-isomer 1b in good yield from E-isomer 1a. A series of (E)- and (Z)-7-arylidenenaltrexone derivatives was prepared to study the effect of larger arylidene groups on opioid receptor affinity in this series. By aldol condensation of naltrexone (6) with benzaldehyde, 1-naphthaldehyde, 2-naphthaldehyde, 4-phenylbenzaldehyde, and 9-anthracaldehyde, the (E)-arylidenes were readily obtained. Photochemical isomerization afforded the corresponding Z-isomers. These compounds were evaluated via opioid receptor radioligand displacement assays. In these assays, the Z-isomers generally had higher affinity and were more delta-selective than the corresponding E-isomers. The (Z)-7-(1-naphthylidene)naltrexone (3b) showed the greatest selectivity (delta:mu ratio of 15) and highest affinity delta-binding (Ki = 0.7 nM). PM3 semiempirical geometry optimizations suggest a significant role for the orientation of the arylidene substituent in the binding affinity and delta-receptor selectivity. This work demonstrates that larger groups may be incorporated into the arylidene portion of the molecule with opioid receptor affinity being retained.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758178,20181015,5310988|5360515|6438353|44377417|44377418|44377496|44377592|44377655|44377678|44377733|44377757,103316748|103417562|103417563|103417751|103417913|103418042|103418095|103418196|103418222|103556473|131283791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9057861,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The inherent lability of peptides and their poor oral absorption have made peptidomimetics attractive targets for drug development. In this presentation I have discussed the design of a novel series of delta-selective opioid antagonists based on the message-address concept. The opioid peptides can be viewed to contain two elements: an essential message component that is recognized by the receptor subsite responsible for the signal transduction process and an address element that is recognized by a subsite that is unique to a single receptor type and functions to enhance binding to the site. Since the tyramine moiety in opiate structures is known to be important for activity, an identical element in Tyr1 of the opioid peptides can be viewed as the message. A key moiety of the delta address was considered to be the phenyl group of Phe4. Combining the universal opioid antagonist naltrexone (5) with a strategically located address mimic afforded naltrindole (6, NTI), the first nonpeptide delta opioid receptor antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758768,20181013,5360515|5486827|5497186|44149909,103230026|103316718|103697951|131283791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1648136,0,,P41143,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

As compared to its 7-deoxy analog 1b, introduction of the 7-keto group did not significantly affect binding to any of the three opioid receptors (mu, kappa, and delta), but caused a 34-fold reduction in sigma-binding, suggesting reduced propensity to induce psychotomimetic effects. The C/D cis isomer of 4b (4c) was much less potent at the three opioid receptors, while displaying a slight increase in sigma affinity.

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation.

The compounds that contain a basic N17' nitrogen (2-9) were found to be selective kappa antagonists. Amidation of N17' afforded congeners 10-12 with feeble kappa antagonist potency and low selectivity. The fact that potent antagonism and selectivity were observed only when members of the series contain a basic N17' nitrogen suggests that it interacts with extracellular domains of the kappa receptor that contain acidic amino acid residues.

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

Rearrangement of 3 (NaOMe) afforded 5,14-exo-(phenyloxyamino)thebainone and derivatives (4a-d); reduction of 3 led to 14-(phenylamino)dihydrocodeinone and derivatives (5a-d). Thebaine also reacted with 1-halo-1-nitrosocyclohexane (halo = Cl, Br) and with benzohydroxamic acid under oxidizing conditions to give 14-(hydroxyamino)codeinone (6). All compounds, 3-6, were evaluated as analgetics and antagonists by the tail-flick, writhing, and Straub tail assays: compounds of types 3-5 were analgetics (N-Me), one-third to one-tenth as potent as morphine, or antagonists [N-(cyclopropylmethyl)], 50 to 100 times less potent than naloxone; 6 behaved as an antagonist in the tail-flick test but as an agonist in the other assays.

Several of these Dyn A analogs exhibit unexpected apparent selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogs has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [L-Pen5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (4), [Cys5,Cys10]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (5), [Cys5,Cys9]DynA1-11-NH2 (6), and [Cys4,Cys9,Arg10]DynA1-11-NH2(7). All of these analogs possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities for the central receptor (guinea pig brain), but effect only weak potency at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (GPI). In fact cyclic dynorphin A analog 4 shows > 19,000-fold differences between central kappa opioid affinity and potency in the guinea pig ileum (GPI). Additionally analog 4 is not an antagonist in the GPI, suggesting possible receptor differences between these sites. Substitution of Tyr1 by Phe1 in the cyclic 1-11 series gave the analog [Phe1,Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) that was surprisingly potent in the guinea pig brain binding assay (IC50 = 15.1 nM) at the kappa receptor, but was inactive in the GPI and mouse vas deferens bioassays. D-Ala2 and Tic4 analogs of 1 had lower affinity at brain kappa receptors and had very weak potencies in the GPI and MVD bioassays. On the other hand, [Cys6,Cys10]DynA1-11-NH2 (8), [Cys8,D-Cys13]DynA1-13-NH2 (9), [D-Cys8,D-Cys12]DynA1-13-NH2 (10), and [D-Pro10,Cys5,Cys13]-Dyn A1-13-NH2 (11) were surprisingly potent in the GPI bioassay, though considerable apparent selectivity for central receptors is still retained.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties.

The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component.

The methyloctahydroisoquinolines 6a-g can exist in conformations where the 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent is either axial or equatorial, similar to the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines 4. The 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is responsible for the antagonist activity observed in the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine antagonists. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 6a shows that the 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is favored in the solid state. Molecular modeling studies also suggest that the equatorial conformation has lower potential energy relative to that of the axial conformation. Evaluation of 6a-g in the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S in vitro functional assay showed that they were opioid receptor pure antagonists.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3.

This double substitution led to a new series of opioid peptides displaying subnanomolar delta antagonist activity and mu agonist or antagonist properties depending on the configuration of the beta-MeCha residue. The most promising analog, H-Dmt-Tic-(2S,3S)-beta-MeCha-Phe-OH was a very selective delta antagonist both in the mouse vas deferens (MVD) assay (Ke = 0.241 +/- 0.05 nM) and in radioligand binding assay (K i delta = 0.48 +/- 0.05 nM, K i mu/K i delta = 2800). The epimeric peptide H-Dmt-Tic-(2S,3R)-beta-MeCha-Phe-OH and the corresponding peptide amide turned out to be mixed partial mu agonist/delta antagonists in the guinea pig ileum and MVD assays.

Thus far, a nonpeptidyl, highly selective and reversible mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonist is unavailable. On the basis of our modeling studies, a series of novel naltrexamine derivatives have been designed and synthesized.

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640634,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,,P41143,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The hydrophobic substituent constant for the adamantyl group has been estimated from the calculated partition coefficients (clogP values) of 31 adamantyl-bearing compounds in the clinic or in development as πadamantyl=3.1, which indicates that the logP value of a compound with high water solubility (logP<<0) could be moved with an adamantyl-based modification to a region that is more clinically useful. The steric bulk of the adamantyl group can: (i) restrict or modulate intramolecular reactivity; and (ii) impede the access of hydrolytic enzymes, thereby increasing drug stability and plasma half life.

727332,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to human cloned DOR in presence of Na+/GDP,"Title: Development of κ opioid receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: κ opioid receptors (KORs) belong to the G-protein-coupled class of receptors (GPCRs). They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents. This Perspective provides a description of preclinical research conducted in the development of several different classes of selective KOR antagonists, a summary of the clinical studies conducted thus far, and recommendations for the type of work needed in the future to determine if these agents would be useful as pharmacotherapies for neuropsychiatric illness.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2327120,20200626,44129648,136928384,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23360448,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We recently reported that N-substituted 3-methyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperazines were a new class of opioid receptor antagonists. In this study, we report the syntheses of two piperazine JDTic-like analogues. Evaluation of the two compounds in an in vitro [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay showed that neither compound showed the high potency and κ opioid receptor selectivity of JDTic. A library of compounds using the core scaffold 21 was synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit [(35)S]GTPγS binding stimulated by the selective κ opioid agonist U69,593. These studies led to N-[(1S)-1-{[(3S)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methylpiperazin-1-yl]methyl}-2-methylpropyl]-4-phenoxybenzamide (11a), a compound that showed good κ opioid receptor antagonist properties.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399074,20200629,5360515|68867300|71680922|71680923|71680924|71681076|71681077|71681078|71681079,131283791|174491695|174491696|174496752|174507179|174512307|174517359|174517360|174522568,4985,,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,,P41143,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The duration of antagonist action in vivo of 41 and its in vitro receptor binding characteristics suggest that covalent association with opiate receptors is not not an important factor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3282289,20200619,5284596|90678779,103170037|242640877,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,197237,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285643,20200618,90678812|90678814,242640974|242640976,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Currently, no small molecules displaying good affinity or selectivity for either subtype have been reported, to decipher the role of NPFF2-R as it relates to opioid-mediated analgesia, for further exploration of NPFF1-R, or for medication development for either subtype. We report the first nonpeptide small molecule scaffold for NPFF1,2-R, the guanidino-piperidines, and SAR studies resulting in the discovery of a NPFF1 agonist (7b, K(i) = 487 ± 117 nM), a NPFF1 antagonist (46, K(i) = 81 ± 17 nM), and a NPFF2 partial antagonist (53a, K(i) = 30 ± 5 nM), which serve as leads for the development of pharmacological probes and potential therapeutic agents.

1261648,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to delta opioid receptor (unknown origin),"Title: Discovery of Novel Multifunctional Ligands with μ/δ Opioid Agonist/Neurokinin-1 (NK1) Antagonist Activities for the Treatment of Pain._||_Abstract: Multifunctional ligands with agonist bioactivities at μ/δ opioid receptors (MOR/DOR) and antagonist bioactivity at the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) have been designed and synthesized. These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

C-Homomorphinan derivatives possessing the δ address moiety such as indole (NTI-type), quinoline, or benzylidene (BNTX-type) functionalities showed the strongest binding affinities for the δ receptor among the three types of opioid receptors, which indicated that the C-homomorphinan skeleton sufficiently functions as a message-part in the ligand.

By revisiting this concept, and based on the structure of tramadol, we designed a series of novel compounds that act as highly potent and selective agonists of DOR among which (-)-6j showed the highest affinity (K i = 2.7 nM), best agonistic activity (EC50 = 2.6 nM), and DOR selectivity (more than 1000-fold over the other two subtype opioid receptors). Molecular docking studies suggest that the 'message' part of (-)-6j interacts with residue Asp128(3.32) and a neighboring water molecule, and the 'address' part of (-)-6j packs with hydrophobic residues Leu300(7.35), Val281(6.55), and Trp284(6.58), rendering DOR selectivity.

Moreover, these three compounds significantly antagonized DAMGO-induced intracellular calcium flux and displayed varying degrees of inhibition on cAMP production. Furthermore, NBF produced much less significant withdrawal effects than naloxone in morphine-pelleted mice. Molecular modeling studies revealed that these bivalent bioisosteres may adopt similar binding modes in the MOR and the 'address' portions of them may have negative or positive allosteric modulation effects on the function of their 'message' portions compared with NAN and INTA.

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM).

It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Hill coefficients significantly different than 1.0, may suggest that the binding displacement does not follow the laws of mass action with a single binding site.Where IC50, Ki, and/or nH data are presented without Standard Error of the Mean (SEM), data are insufficient to be quantitative, and the values presented (Ki, IC50, nH) should be interpreted with caution.",51,Vanderbilt Specialized Chemistry Center,Radioligand Binding assays (Eurofin) ML354 VU704-PAR4 (VU-238) PAR4 Antagonists,20130410,60210843,144241412,134|135|140|150|153|154|367|623|624|775|779|1128|1129|1131|1134|1135|1268|1269|1813|1814|1815|1909|1910|1950|2099|2550|2908|3269|3274|3350|3351|3359|3757|3762|4543|4886|4887|4985|4986|4988|5724|5734|6529|6530|6531|6532|6869|9311|10800|11255|12287|16176|23683|24173|24408|25265|25638|29336|29412|29413|29689|298521|306255|100351535,,AAA20580|AAA39276|AAA51772|AAA60108|AAA64369|AAA83426|AAB19751|AAB20278|AAB20466|AAB23443|AAB26274|AAB46803|AAD17521|AAD49439|AAO92062|AAQ91594|AAR23925|AAR36879|AAS83395|BAA01763|BAA25897|BAA84279|CAA01819|CAA05851|CAA09939|CAA38484|CAA40962|CAA49603|CAA58565|NP_000015|NP_000060|NP_000106|NP_000116|NP_000614|NP_000665|NP_000666|NP_000668|NP_000672|NP_000675|NP_000701|NP_000710|NP_000729|NP_000731|NP_000949|NP_001006632|NP_001034612|NP_001035993|NP_001036|NP_001091683|NP_001106187|NP_001153730|NP_001832|NP_005949|NP_006630|NP_009163|NP_036932|NP_037233|NP_058687|NP_058706|NP_058887|NP_077809|O94806|Q15822|Q4G017|XP_002719791,Legacy Depositors|NIH Initiatives,,0,2.7.11.13|3.1.4.53,AAA20580|AAA51772|AAA60108|AAA64369|AAB19751|AAB20466|AAB23443|AAB46803|AAD17521|AAD49439|AAQ91594|AAR36879|AAS83395|BAA25897|CAA05851|CAA09939|CAA38484|CAA49603|CAA58565|NP_058687|O55017|O94806|P02708|P03372|P07550|P08172|P08588|P08908|P08913|P0DMS8|P10749|P11229|P14416|P20309|P21554|P23944|P24530|P25021|P25101|P25103|P25929|P28222|P29274|P30411|P30542|P31645|P34972|P35367|P35408|P35439|P41143|P42264|P43140|P46663|P48039|P49146|P49651|P54748|Q13698|Q13936|Q15822|Q4G017|Q9Y271|Q9Y5N1|XP_002719791,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1
