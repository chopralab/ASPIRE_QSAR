Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

Activation of nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptors has been postulated to account for certain aspects of buprenorphine's behavioral profile. In order to investigate the role of NOP activation further, a series of buprenorphine analogues has been synthesized with the aim of increasing affinity for the NOP receptor.

These shifts in functional activity are often accompanied by negligible changes in binding affinity. The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest.

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies. Compounds 4, 5, and 9 with agonist efficacies between 25% and 35% significantly attenuated motor deficits in the 6-OHDA-hemilesioned rat model of PD.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives.

The synthesis of 3 was accomplished in eight steps from 3-triisopropylsilyl-6-beta-aminomorphine and 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-D-glucose. The C-glycoside 3 was prepared with the objective of examining a metabolically stable analogue of morphine-6-glucuronide and determining the potency and selectivity of opioid receptor binding. Competition binding assays showed that 3 bound to the mu opioid receptor with a Ki value of 3.5 nM. The C-glycoside 3 exhibited delta/mu and kappa/mu selectivity ratios of 76 and 165, respectively. The synthetic intermediate (i.e., benzyl precursor, compound 11) bound to the mu opioid receptor with a Ki value of 0.5 nM, was less selective for the mu opioid receptor. The [35S]GTPgammaS assay was used to evaluate the functional properties of compounds 3 and 11. Compound 3 was determined to be a full agonist at the mu opioid receptor, whereas compound 11 was found to be a partial agonist. Compound 3 was determined to be very stable in the presence of human liver S9, and rat and monkey liver microsomes: no detectable loss of 3 was observed up to 90 min. Compound 3 was also very stable at pH 2 and pH 7.4, suggesting that 3 possessed properties for sustained duration of action.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL839554,20181018,5360621|44390336|44390346|44390358|44390359,103416752|103444855|103444870|103444887|103444888,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15745801,0,,P35372,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Standard treatment, targeting monoamine transporters selective for the neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline, is not able to help many patients that are poor responders. This study advances the development of sazetidine-A analogues that interact with α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as partial agonists and that possess favorable antidepressant profiles. The resulting compounds that are highly selective for the α4β2 subtype of nAChR over α3β4-nAChRs are partial agonists at the α4β2 subtype and have excellent antidepressant behavioral profiles as measured by the mouse forced swim test. Preliminary absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies for one promising ligand revealed an excellent plasma protein binding (PPB) profile, low CYP450-related metabolism, and low cardiovascular toxicity, suggesting it is a promising lead as well as a drug candidate to be advanced through the drug discovery pipeline.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1838627,20200629,56595309,134450722,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21905669,0,,P35372,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects. These novel chemical entities could potentially be advanced to the clinic as new drug candidates for treating depression.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026508,20200626,45254040|56951368|56951495,160678244|160688954|160705128,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22171543,0,,P35372,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429168,20210302,130431318,440152147,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,,P35372,9606,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

The investigations of amide-type NTI derivatives revealed that N-phenylacetyl and N-dihydrocinnamoyl derivatives 3a and 3b were DOR full agonists. The same transformations were applied to a DOR agonist KNT-127 to provide the more potent DOR agonists 6a and 6b. Among the tested compounds, the most efficacious compound 6a showed dose-dependent antidepressant-like effects in the mouse forced swim test. The antidepressant-like effects by 6a seemed to be more potent than those of KNT-127, which is a more potent DOR agonist in in vitro assays.
