These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand. We conclude that the conversion of the O3(2-carbomethoxyallyl) ether electrophilic ligands to their parent phenols accounts for their activity in the opioid radioligand displacement assay.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754005,20181013,1223|443408|644209|5284596|5284604|5360515|5480230|5486554|5497186|10026312|10046467|10321082|10346220|10350630|10414887|10455862|10455974|10459444|10481516,103170037|103189159|103250876|103279059|103381210|103381309|103381569|103381570|103381656|103381934|103381936|103381980|103382010|103416406|103697951|103698780|131283791|160708234|242084509,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1335078,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

The affinities of the 6 beta- and 6 alpha-O-ether with benzyl, biphenylmethyl, 1- and 2-naphthylmethyl, and 9-anthracylmethyl groups were determined. Preparation of the ligands was accomplished from suitably 3-O-protected derivatives of 6 and 7 by phase transfer catalyzed alkylation using aralkyl halides, followed by deprotection. Both 3-O-trityl and -benzyl protecting groups were used. In radioligand displacement assays, compounds from the 6 alpha-O ether series had higher affinity than the analogous diastereomers in the 6 beta-O series, with few exceptions. In the 6 alpha-O series, the benzyl ether (29) and the biphenylmethyl ether (30) had the highest affinity, similar to naltrexone. In the 6 beta-O series, the benzyl ether had the highest affinity.

These enantiomers, (-)- and (+)-4.HCl, were prepared by esterification of the corresponding alcohols, (+)- and (-)-4a. Single crystal X-ray studies of (-)-4a.HCl reveal that it possesses the 2R,4S absolute configuration. Analgetic testing in mice (hot-plate) and receptor binding studies indicate that (-)-(2S,4R)-4.HCl is approximately ten times more potent than its enantiomer. The results are consistent with the operation of the Ogston effect in the interaction of achiral 4-phenylpiperidines with opioid receptors. Additionally, it is suggested that the piperidine ring of these and other closely related 4-phenylpiperidines bind within a receptor subsite cleft whose dimensions exclude diequatorial 2,6- and 3,5-dimethyl-substituted ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755152,20181002,4741130|6542471|44272414,103184211|103184536|160686191,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6283082,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

Condensed-phase molecular dynamics simulations are applied to evaluate potential relationships between ligand conformation and fentanyl substitution and to generate probable 'bioactive' structures for the ligand series. Automated docking of the largely populated solution conformers identified a common binding site orientation that places the N-phenethyl group of fentanyl deep in a crevice between transmembrane (TM) helices II and III while the N-phenylpropanamide group projected toward a pocket formed by TM-III, -VI, and -VII domains. An analysis of the binding modes indicates the most potent fentanyl derivatives adopt an extended conformation both in solution and in the bound state, suggesting binding affinity may depend on the conformational preferences of the ligands. The results are consistent with ligand binding data derived from chimeric and mutant receptor studies as well as structure-activity relationship data reported on a wide range of fentanyl analogues. The binding site model is also compared to that of N-phenethylnormorphine. An overlay of the bound conformation of the opiate and cis-3-methylfentanyl shows the N-phenethyl groups occupy equivalent binding domains in the receptor. While the cationic amines of both ligand classes were found docked to an established anchor site (D149 in TM-III), no overlap was observed between the N-phenylpropanamide group and the remaining components of the opiate scaffold. The unique binding mode(s) proposed for the fentanyl series may, in part, explain the difficulties encountered in defining models of recognition at the mu-receptor and suggest opioid receptors may display multiple binding epitopes. Furthermore, the results provide new insight to the design of experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis to the differential selectivities of ligands at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751574,20181017,3345|62156|124716|3041260|9976188|10021831|10428991,103173010|103182112|103224159|103349831|103349832|103349834|103734588,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10669565,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

241,226069,Confirmatory,Opioid receptor activity in guinea pig ileum assay,"Title: Synthesis and opioid activity of dynorphin A-(1-13)NH2 analogues containing cis- and trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid._||_Abstract: It has been proposed that the 'message' sequence of dynorphin A (Dyn A) exists in an extended conformation in aqueous solution (Schiller, P. W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors. The cis-ACCA analogue showed very weak opioid activity (IC50 = 4.0 microM) in the guinea pig ileum.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844034,20181014,25079852|73351482,103173862|174505355,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097539,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Evidence for the existence of different mu receptor subtypes in different tissues._||_Abstract: A series of beta-funaltrexamine (2, beta-FNA) analogues (3-14) were synthesized that contain a variety of electrophilic groups attached at the 6 beta-position of the opiate. The opioid agonist and antagonist activities of these ligands were evaluated in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) in vitro assays. Several of the compounds behaved like beta-FNA in that they exhibited reversible agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors and irreversible antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. The rank order of irreversible antagonism for a series of related Michael acceptors did not parallel their intrinsic chemical reactivity, confirming that the degree of covalent binding is in part dependent on the spatial disposition of the electrophilic center relative to the receptor nucleophile (secondary recognition). The maleimidoacetamide 8 behaved very differently from beta-FNA in that it exhibited considerably greater irreversible mu antagonism in MVD relative to the mu blockage in the GPI. This suggests that different proportions of mu receptor subtypes exist in the two tissues. Several of the agents tested, including some nonreactive control compounds, displayed an unusual type of persistent kappa agonist activity in the GPI.

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors. The cis-ACCA analogue showed very weak opioid activity (IC50 = 4.0 microM) in the guinea pig ileum.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL840919,20200703,25079852,103173862,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097539,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro. This study provides additional information about the molecular determinants for mu recognition, the structural features affecting ligand binding, and the structure function relationships.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909317,20181021,134131|5284596|5360515|16094317|16094318|16094319|16094320|16094321|16094322|16094342|16094343|16094345|16094346|16094347,103170037|103310529|103503700|103503761|103503763|103503773|103503781|103503789|103503790|103503796|103503797|103503798|103503803|131283791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149858,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1013976,20181024,5284596,103170037,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a hydrolase, LTA 4H stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of the unstable epoxide LTA 4 to the diol LTB 4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and a chemoattractant of eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening. From this work we identified a series of benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzimidazole inhibitors.

However, most opioids currently available have a variety of side-effects as well as exhibiting tolerance.

To identify a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors, we used the recently described conformation-state sensitive antibodies and screened a panel of endogenous peptides from rodent brain or adipose tissue. This led to the identification of hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH) as a peptide ligand that selectively binds CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. We find that hemopressin is a CB(1) receptor-selective antagonist, because it is able to efficiently block signaling by CB(1) receptors but not by other members of family A G protein-coupled receptors (including the closely related CB(2) receptors). Hemopressin also behaves as an inverse agonist of CB(1) receptors, because it is able to block the constitutive activity of these receptors to the same extent as its well characterized antagonist, rimonabant. Finally, we examine the activity of hemopressin in vivo using different models of pain and find that it exhibits antinociceptive effects when administered by either intrathecal, intraplantar, or oral routes, underscoring hemopressin's therapeutic potential. These results represent a demonstration of a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors that also exhibits analgesic properties. These findings are likely to have a profound impact on the development of novel therapeutics targeting CB(1) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL992344,20181025,44560117,103583213,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18077343,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

An amide precursor (2) was synthesized and methylated with [(11)C]iodomethane to give [(11)C]3. After administration of [(11)C]3 to wild-type mice, brain radioactivity uptake was very low. In P-gp (mdr-1a(-/-)) knockout mice, brain uptake of radioactivity at 30 min increased about 3.5-fold by PET measures, and over 7-fold by ex vivo measures. In knockout mice, brain radioactivity was predominantly (90%) unchanged radiotracer. In monkey PET experiments, brain radioactivity uptake was also very low but after P-gp blockade increased more than 7-fold.

In the key step of the synthesis 2-bromocinnamaldehyde acetal 5 was added to piperidones 6 with various substituents at the N-atom. Unexpectedly, this reaction led to 2-benzoxepines 8, which were contracted with acid to afford the spirocyclic 2-benzofuranacetaldehydes 9. The best yields were obtained, when the transformations up to the alcohols 10 were performed without isolation of intermediates. Generally the (2-fluoroethyl) derivatives 3 have higher σ(1) affinity and σ(1)/σ(2) selectivity than the corresponding (3-fluoropropyl) derivatives 2. The most promising candidate for the development as radiotracer is the (2-fluoroethyl) derivative 3a (WMS-1828, fluspidine, 1'-benzyl-3-(2-fluoroethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]), which shows subnanomolar σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.59nM) and excellent selectivity over the σ(2) subtype (1331-fold) as well as some other receptor systems. The novel synthetic strategy also allows the systematic pharmacological evaluation of intermediate alcohols 10.

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets. Altogether lersivirine is a highly potent and selective NNRTI, with excellent efficacy against NNRTI-resistant viruses.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1691875,20200626,16739244,103708524,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20660667,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Reduced levels of GSNO, as well as other nitrosothiols (SNOs), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including those of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems.

On the basis of receptor binding assays in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing cloned human opioid receptors, (S)-3-fluoro-4-(4-((2-(3-fluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl)phenoxy)benzamide (25) had a K(i) = 0.565 nM for κ opioid receptor binding while having a K(i) = 35.8 nM for μ opioid receptors and a K(i) = 211 nM for δ opioid receptor binding. Compound 25 was also a potent antagonist of κ opioid receptors when tested in vitro using a [(35)S]-guanosine 5'O-[3-thiotriphosphate] ([(35)S]GTP-γ-S) functional assay in CHO cells expressing cloned human opioid receptors. Compounds were also evaluated for potential use as receptor occupancy tracers.

589,642499,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu opioid receptor,"Title: Synthesis, radiofluorination and pharmacological evaluation of a fluoromethyl spirocyclic PET tracer for central σ1 receptors and comparison with fluoroalkyl homologs._||_Abstract: The spirocyclic σ(1) receptor ligand 1 (1'-benzyl-3-(fluoromethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was prepared in four steps starting from methoxy derivative 5. Due to its high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.74nM) and selectivity against several other relevant targets, 1 was investigated as (18)F-labeled PET tracer and its biological properties were compared with those of homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 2-4. The fluoromethyl derivative 1 was faster metabolized in vitro than homologs 2-4. In contrast to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]2-4, the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 15 using the K[(18)F]F-K(222)-carbonate complex required heating to 150°C in DMSO to achieve high labeling efficiencies. Whereas radiometabolites of [(18)F]2-4 were not detected in vivo in the brain of mice, two radiometabolites of [(18)F]1 were found. Analysis of ex vivo autoradiography images provided rather low target-to-nontarget ratio for [(18)F]1 compared with [(18)F]2-4. [(18)F]1 showed a fast uptake in the brain, which decreased continuously over time. The brain-to-plasma ratio of the radiotracer [(18)F]1 was only exceeded by the fluoroethyl tracer [(18)F]2.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1941653,20200626,44474938|50994498|56840667|57402462,103697992|124958368|136930451|136943461,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22136765,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Synthesis of an N-substituted 4-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan with high affinity and selective μ-antagonist activity._||_Abstract: A simple three-step synthesis of 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-ol (3a) was achieved using an osmium tetroxide mediated oxidation of the known intermediate 6. A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity. The modest change in spatial position of the hydroxyl moiety, and not the N-substituent, induced the change from potent agonist to an antagonist of moderate potency.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1955138,20200626,5284596|57391716|57396944,103170037|136923502|136933180,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22341895,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Med. Chem.     2011  ,   54  ,   5562 - 5575  ). This new series produced similar potency and selectivity among the NOS isoforms and was devoid of any cardiovascular liabilities associated with QT prolongation due to hERG activity or endothelial NOS mediated vasoconstriction effect. The SAR studies led to the identification of cis-45, which was shown to reverse thermal hyperalgesia in vivo in the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain with excellent safety profile (off-target activities at 80 CNS related receptors/ion channels/transporters). The results presented in this report make cis-45 as an ideal tool for evaluating the potential role of selective nNOS inhibitors in CNS related disorders where excess NO produced by nNOS is thought to play a crucial role.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1959638,20180921,56924689,136924368,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22175766,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

GSNO and SNOs are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including those in respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. The pyrrole based N6022 was recently identified as a potent, selective, reversible, and efficacious GSNOR inhibitor which is currently in clinical development for acute asthma. We describe here the synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of novel pyrrole based analogs of N6022 focusing on carboxamide modifications on the pendant N-phenyl moiety.

Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1.

The arylsulfanyl pyrazolone (ASP) scaffold was one of the active scaffolds identified in a cell-based high throughput screening assay targeting mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) induced toxicity and aggregation as a marker for ALS. The initial ASP hit compounds were potent and had favorable ADME properties but had poor microsomal and plasma stability. Here, we identify the microsomal metabolite and describe synthesized analogues of these ASP compounds to address the rapid metabolism. Both in vitro potency and pharmacological properties of the ASP scaffold have been dramatically improved via chemical modification to the corresponding sulfone and ether derivatives. One of the ether analogues (13), with superior potency and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties, was tested in vivo for its pharmacokinetic profile, brain penetration, and efficacy in an ALS mouse model. The analogue showed sustained blood and brain levels in vivo and significant activity in the mouse model of ALS, thus validating the new aryloxanyl pyrazolone scaffold as an important novel therapeutic lead for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167437,20180923,45102767,136923905,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22191331,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Clinical utility of nonselective sodium channel blockers is limited due to serious adverse drug effects. Here, we present the optimization, structure-activity relationships, and in vitro and in vivo characterization of a novel series of Na(V)1.7 inhibitors based on the oxoisoindoline core. Extensive studies with focus on optimization of Na(V)1.7 potency, selectivity over Na(V)1.5, and metabolic stability properties produced several interesting oxoisoindoline carboxamides (16A, 26B, 28, 51, 60, and 62) that were further characterized. The oxoisoindoline carboxamides interacted with the local anesthetics binding site. In spite of this, several compounds showed functional selectivity versus Na(V)1.5 of more than 100-fold. This appeared to be a combination of subtype and state-dependent selectivity. Compound 28 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of nerve injury-induced ectopic in an ex vivo DRG preparation from SNL rats.

In the present article, the adopted rationale is the possible modulation of the receptor affinity of the cAmp containing EM-2 analogues by assigning a different stereochemistry to the Phe(3) and Phe(4) residues present in the ring. Thus, eight more analogues with different absolute configuration at the chiral center of the aromatic residues in positions 3 and 4 have been synthesized and their opioid activity examined. The stereochemical change at the α-carbon atoms leads to a meaningful enhancement of the affinity and activity toward μ opioid receptors with respect to the prototype compound 9: e.g., 9a, K(i)(μ) = 63 nM, GPI (IC(50)) = 480 nM; 9b, K(i)(μ) = 38 nM, GPI (IC(50)) = 330 nM.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2176093,20200625,71449909|71451723|71451725|71455267|71455269|71457058|71460725|71462450,163314235|163317682|163317683|163324519|163324520|163327971|163334981|163338389,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22966938,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Whereas the incorporation of a 3-phenylpropoxy group at C-14 on N-methylpyridomorhinan gave a dual MOR agonist/DOR agonist 17h, its incorporation on N-cyclopropylmethylpyridomorphinan gave a MOR agonist/DOR antagonist 17d. Interestingly, 17d, in contrast to 17h, did not produce tolerance or dependence effects upon prolonged treatment in cells expressing MOR and DOR.

The affinity of the 5-phenylmorphans for opioid receptors is increased by a C8-methyl substituent, compared with its C7 analog. The affinity of the newly synthesized compounds is generally for the μ-opioid receptor, rather than the δ- or κ-receptors. Addition of a new cyclohexane ring to the C7 and C8 positions on the cyclohexane ring of the 5-phenylmorphans enhances μ-receptor affinity, bringing the Ki to the subnanomolar level.

Currently, there is no highly selective, nonpeptidyl and reversible mu opioid receptor antagonist available. Among a series of naltrexamine derivatives that have been designed and synthesized, two compounds, NAP and NAQ, were previously identified as novel leads for this purpose based on their in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profiles. Both compounds displayed high binding affinity and selectivity to the mu opioid receptor. To further study the interaction of these two ligands with the three opioid receptors, the recently released opioid receptor crystal structures were employed in docking studies to further test our original hypothesis that the ligands recognize a unique 'address' domain in the mu opioid receptor involving Trp318 that facilitates their selectivity. These modeling results were supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies on the mu opioid receptor, where the mutants Y210A and W318A confirmed the role of the latter in binding.

An in vitro study in the rat._||_Abstract: We have previously found that phenanthrenic opioids, including codeine, modulate morphine glucuronidation in the rat. Here codeine and five of its derivatives were compared in their effects on the synthesis of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) from morphine by rat liver microsomal preparations, and by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes previously incubated for 72 h with either codeine or its derivatives. Acetylcodeine and pivaloylcodeine shared the capability of the parent compound of inhibiting the synthesis of M3G by liver microsomes through a noncompetitive mechanism of action. Their IC50 were 3.25, 2.27, and 4.32 μM, respectively. Dihydrocodeine, acetyldihydrocodeine, and lauroylcodeine were ineffective. In all the experimental circumstances M6G was undetectable in the incubation medium. In primary hepatocyte cultures codeine only inhibited M3G formation, but with a lower efficacy than that observed with microsomes (IC50 20.91 vs 4.32 μM). Preliminary results show that at micromolar concentrations codeine derivatives exhibit a low rate of affinity for μ opiate receptors. In conclusion, acetyl and pivaloyl derivatives of codeine noncompetitively inhibit liver glucuronidation of morphine interacting with microsomes.

They are also employed in fluorescent binding assays. This study is centered on the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of fluorescent probes for the opioid receptors, for which relatively few non-peptidic fluorescent probes currently exist. The known μ-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist, buprenorphine, was structurally elaborated to include an amidoalkylamine linker moiety that was coupled with a range of fluorophores to afford new fluorescent probes. All compounds proved to be selective MOR antagonists. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the probe incorporating a sulfonated cyanine-5 fluorophore was the most appropriate for imaging studies. This ligand was subsequently employed in an automated fluorescence-based competition binding assay, allowing the pKi values of several well-known opioid ligands to be determined. Thus, this new probe will prove useful in future studies of MOR receptor pharmacology.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3748893,20200623,127037941|127038943|127041896|127042159,336886868|336888136|336892060|336892408,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26632862,0,,P35372,9606,,,,1,0,1,1,1,1
780,1272387,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu type opioid receptor (unknown origin) by competition binding assay,"Title: Receptor binding profiles and quantitative structure-affinity relationships of some 5-substituted-N,N-diallyltryptamines._||_Abstract: N,N-Diallyltryptamine (DALT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) are two tryptamines synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin. In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values. At the σ2 receptor, higher affinity was correlated with increasing π. These correlations should aid in the development of more potent and selective drugs within this family of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756495,20200623,24839550|50878551|127026052|127036186|127036932|127036953,174496429|336866908|336883200|336884944|336884983|336885079,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26739781,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Calculated physiochemical properties for 3b suggest that it will cross the blood-brain barrier.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3815463,20200624,9956146|122189011|127048683|127050532|127050866|127052128|127052129|127052130,103171185|318387975|336901720|336904262|336904725|336906454|336906455|336906456,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27364611,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

We herein report that potassium permanganate supported on iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate can be used as a convenient oxidant in the one-step, heterogeneous conversion of Δ7,8-opioids to the corresponding 7β-hydroxy-8-ketones. Details of the reaction mechanism are given and the effects of the substituent at position 6 of several opioids on the reaction outcome is discussed.

Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or 99mTc for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) or the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEK cells transfected with μ (HEK-mu) or δ (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity.

Based on 3 functionally α6β2/3γ2 GABAAR selective pyrazoloquinolinones, 42 novel analogs were synthesized, and their in vitro metabolic stability and cytotoxicity as well as their in vivo pharmacokinetics, basic behavioral pharmacology, and effects on locomotion were investigated. Incorporation of deuterium into the methoxy substituents of the ligands increased their duration of action via improved metabolic stability and bioavailability, while their selectivity for the GABAAR α6 subtype was retained. 8b was identified as the lead compound with a substantially improved pharmacokinetic profile. The ligands allosterically modulated diazepam insensitive α6β2/3γ2 GABAARs and were functionally silent at diazepam sensitive α1β2/3γ2 GABAARs, thus no sedation was detected.

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041179,20200621,72771081,242581035,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase catalytic activity of the tankyrases (TNKS/TNKS2) has been reported to reduce the Wnt/β-catenin signal by preventing poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent degradation of AXIN, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. With the goal of investigating the effects of tankyrase and Wnt pathway inhibition on tumor growth, we set out to find small-molecule inhibitors of TNKS/TNKS2 with suitable drug-like properties. Starting from 1a, a high-throughput screening hit, the spiroindoline derivative 40c (RK-287107) was discovered as a potent TNKS/TNKS2 inhibitor with >7000-fold selectivity against the PARP1 enzyme, which inhibits WNT-responsive TCF reporter activity and proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell line COLO-320DM. RK-287107 also demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a mouse xenograft model. These observations suggest that RK-287107 is a promising lead compound for the development of novel tankyrase inhibitors as anticancer agents.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4388203,20210302,137701512,440124627,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30883102,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Acyl-glycine inhibitors, however, are selective for GlyT2 and have been shown to provide analgesia in animal models of pain with minimal side effects, but are comparatively weak GlyT2 inhibitors. Here, we modify the simple acyl-glycine by synthesizing lipid analogues with a range of amino acid head groups in both l- and d-configurations, to produce nanomolar affinity, selective GlyT2 inhibitors. The potent inhibitor oleoyl-d-lysine (33) is also resistant to degradation in both human and rat plasma and liver microsomes, and is rapidly absorbed following an intraperitoneal injection to rats and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that 33 provides greater analgesia at lower doses, and does not possess the severe side effects of the very slowly reversible GlyT2 inhibitor, ORG25543 (2).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4481215,20210302,155547990,440175629,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30714733,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 8-amino group was hypothesized to be a replacement for the prototypic 8-OH substituent for 2,6-methano-3-benzazocines and related opiates. This OH group is generally required for binding yet is implicated in unfavorable pharmacokinetic characteristics such as low oral bioavailability and rapid clearance via O-glucuronidation. The core structures in which the 8-OH group was replaced were cyclazocine and its enantiomers, ethylketocyclazocine and its enantiomers, ketocyclazocine, and Mr2034. Many new analogues had high affinity for opioid receptors with several in the subnanomolar range. Highest affinity was seen in analogues with secondary 8-(hetero)arylamino appendages. Binding to opioid receptors was enantioselective with the (2R,6R,11R)-configuration preferred and high selectivity for mu and kappa over delta opioid receptors was observed within the series. Several derivatives were shown to have intrinsic opioid-receptor-mediated activity in [(35)S]GTPgammaS assays.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749733,20181017,3037926|10334091|11779453|44273397|44380980|44380994|73351393,103186171|103241212|103425120|103425148|103425149|103425709|174505237,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12593663,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752474,20200628,118718756,312365627,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic. The unique structural features of JDTic will make this compound highly useful in further characterization of the kappa receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754373,20181017,11070421,163336637,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12825951,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The key step in the synthesis of the target compound involves the ring opening of Cbz-d-serine beta-lactone with Boc-Phe-NHCH2CH2NHCH3. Further synthetic elaboration of the resulting building block yielded compound 1 (MABE, Tyr-c[(NbetaCH3)-D-A2pr-Gly-Phe-NHCH2CH2-], where A2pr is a 2,3-diaminopropionic acid residue). Utilizing a combination of NMR and molecular modeling, the structure-biological activity relationships for compound 1 were studied. Using an in vitro isolated receptor assay, MABE was found to have affinities for isolated mu delta, and kappa opioid receptors of 1.6, 2.1, and 340 nM, respectively. By an in vivo thermal escape assay, MABE was found to have an ED50 of 0.027 microg in the rat when administered intrathecally. This effect was reversed by naloxone.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic. The unique structural features of JDTic will make this compound highly useful in further characterization of the kappa receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756762,20181017,9826034,103583410,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12825951,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The use of these neuroactive peptides in diverse studies has led to an increased understanding of brain function. Unfortunately, the use of brain-derived peptides as pharmaceutical agents to alter brain chemistry in vivo has lagged because peptides do not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Attachment of simple sugars to enkephalins increases their penetration of the blood-brain barrier and allows the resulting glycopeptide analogues to function effectively as drugs. The delta-selective glycosylated Leu-enkephalin amide 2, H(2)N-Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ser(beta-D-Glc)-CONH(2), produces analgesic effects similar to morphine, even when administered peripherally, yet possesses reduced dependence liability as indicated by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal studies.

In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors. Analogues (3 and 6-8) which were shown to have relatively weak delta-opioid receptor antagonist potency have their aromatic groups located in a space that is different from that of the more potent analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL871693,20200703,5310988|5491688|5497186|6438353|46877673|46877674|46877676|46877677,103316748|103556473|103697951|103734768|103734769|103734771|103734772|103734773,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8126697,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

All of the ligands were delta-selective when tested against standard agonists in smooth muscle preparations. However, the rank-order delta antagonism of antinociception in mice did not parallel the in vitro pharmacologic data. The 5'-isothiocyanate 2 was the most potent and selective antagonist in vivo, causing a 52-fold increase of the ED50 for [D-Ser2,D-Leu5]enkephalin-Thr6 (DSLET) and no increase for [D-Pen2,D-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE). The effect of each of the ligands on the binding of [3H]DSLET and [3H]DPDPE to guinea pig brain membranes clearly differentiated between the binding sites that recognize these radioligands.

Evidence for the existence of different mu receptor subtypes in different tissues._||_Abstract: A series of beta-funaltrexamine (2, beta-FNA) analogues (3-14) were synthesized that contain a variety of electrophilic groups attached at the 6 beta-position of the opiate. The opioid agonist and antagonist activities of these ligands were evaluated in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) in vitro assays. Several of the compounds behaved like beta-FNA in that they exhibited reversible agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors and irreversible antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. The rank order of irreversible antagonism for a series of related Michael acceptors did not parallel their intrinsic chemical reactivity, confirming that the degree of covalent binding is in part dependent on the spatial disposition of the electrophilic center relative to the receptor nucleophile (secondary recognition). The maleimidoacetamide 8 behaved very differently from beta-FNA in that it exhibited considerably greater irreversible mu antagonism in MVD relative to the mu blockage in the GPI. This suggests that different proportions of mu receptor subtypes exist in the two tissues. Several of the agents tested, including some nonreactive control compounds, displayed an unusual type of persistent kappa agonist activity in the GPI. This activity, which was reversed by addition of naloxone, reappeared upon washing. Receptor models have been presented to explain this effect. A few of the reactive ligands displayed a true nonreversible kappa agonist activity, suggesting a covalent association with the receptor. Of note in this regard was the propiolamide 6, which appeared to be an irreversible mixed agonist-antagonist at kappa and mu receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850207,20200628,44276305,103196829,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6090663,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point.

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn.

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1017471,20181024,5284596,103170037,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

As a hydrolase, LTA 4H stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of the unstable epoxide LTA 4 to the diol LTB 4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and a chemoattractant of eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening. From this work we identified a series of benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzimidazole inhibitors.

The series similarity to previously reported sigma ligands prompted analysis at sigma receptors to determine the SAR for affinity at sigma receptors. Within the N-substituent series the saturated analogs showed increased affinity at both sigma receptors. Optimal chain length in the N-arylalkyl series for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors proved to be N-propylphenyl; extension to a four carbon chain dramatically decreased affinity at both receptors. Substituents in the 4-position affect only sigma(1) affinity; no change in affinity at sigma(2) was shown. The N-isobutyl, N-phenylpropyl, and N-benzyl analogs are worth pursuing due to their good affinity and selectivity at the sigma(1) receptor, whereas the N-benzyl analog exhibits the greatest selectivity for sigma(1).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL995853,20181026,62513|191408|13046858|13599612|18997149|24885962|24885965|24886211|24886213,103628005|103628006|103628007|103628060|103628061|103628062|103628063|103628064|103628065,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17988766,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022876,20180910,17758320,103530856,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In P-gp (mdr-1a(-/-)) knockout mice, brain uptake of radioactivity at 30 min increased about 3.5-fold by PET measures, and over 7-fold by ex vivo measures. In knockout mice, brain radioactivity was predominantly (90%) unchanged radiotracer. In monkey PET experiments, brain radioactivity uptake was also very low but after P-gp blockade increased more than 7-fold. [(11)C]3 is an effective new radiotracer for imaging brain P-gp function and, in favor of future successful quantification, appears free of extensive brain-penetrant radiometabolites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1027229,20181026,9805944,103606134,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18783208,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

To overcome metabolic instability and poor membrane permeability, the N- and C-termini of Endo-1 were modified by lipoamino acids (Laa) and/or sugars, and 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) replacement of Tyr. Analogues were assessed for mu-opioid receptor affinity, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, enzymatic stability, and permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers. C-terminus modification decreased receptor affinity, while N-terminus C8-Laa improved stability and permeability with slight change in receptor affinity. Dmt provided a promising lead compound: [C8Laa-Dmt[1]]-Endo-1 is nine times more stable (t(1/2)=43.5min), >8-fold more permeable in Caco-2 cell monolayers, and exhibits 140-fold greater mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(imu)=0.08nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL955666,20181025,5311080|11983337|44586706|44586707|44586708|44586709|44586711|44586712|44586714|44586715|44586716|44593682,103293205|103531554|103642395|103642396|103642397|103642398|103642400|103642401|103642403|103642404|103642405|103642406,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18468445,0,,P35372,9606,19.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

These receptors, either singly or as a heterodimer, activate common signal transduction pathways mediated through the inhibitory G proteins (G(i) and G(o)). Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy, we show that in the heterodimer, the MOR and alpha2A-AR communicate with each other through a cross-conformational switch that permits direct inhibition of one receptor by the other with subsecond kinetics. We discovered that morphine binding to the MOR triggers a conformational change in the norepinephrine-occupied alpha2A-AR that inhibits its signaling to G(i) and the downstream MAP kinase cascade. These data highlight a new mechanism in signal transduction whereby a G protein-coupled receptor heterodimer mediates conformational changes that propagate from one receptor to the other and cause the second receptor's rapid inactivation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1244051,20200702,5288826,103169185,150|4988,,P08913|P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18193048,0,,P08913|P35372,,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Competition studies demonstrated high affinity of the unlabelled compounds for opioid receptors in transfected cell lines, as did the direct binding of the (125)I-ligands to the opioid receptors. The radioligand displayed very high sensitivity, enabling a marked reduction in tissue, as well as excellent signal/noise characteristics.

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP). Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1.

Specific examples include diseases of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems. The most significant pathway for cellular response to hypoxia is the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIFs are transcription factors responsible for the activation of genes which encode proteins that mediate adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. A high-throughput cell-based HIF-mediated gene reporter screen was carried out using the NIH's Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository to identify activators of the HIF pathway.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2398952,20200629,71680922|71680923|71681076,174491696|174512307|174517359,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

An in vitro study in the rat._||_Abstract: We have previously found that phenanthrenic opioids, including codeine, modulate morphine glucuronidation in the rat. Here codeine and five of its derivatives were compared in their effects on the synthesis of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) from morphine by rat liver microsomal preparations, and by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes previously incubated for 72 h with either codeine or its derivatives. Acetylcodeine and pivaloylcodeine shared the capability of the parent compound of inhibiting the synthesis of M3G by liver microsomes through a noncompetitive mechanism of action. Their IC50 were 3.25, 2.27, and 4.32 μM, respectively. Dihydrocodeine, acetyldihydrocodeine, and lauroylcodeine were ineffective. In all the experimental circumstances M6G was undetectable in the incubation medium. In primary hepatocyte cultures codeine only inhibited M3G formation, but with a lower efficacy than that observed with microsomes (IC50 20.91 vs 4.32 μM). Preliminary results show that at micromolar concentrations codeine derivatives exhibit a low rate of affinity for μ opiate receptors. In conclusion, acetyl and pivaloyl derivatives of codeine noncompetitively inhibit liver glucuronidation of morphine interacting with microsomes. This study further strengths the notion that phenanthrenic opioids can modulate morphine glucuronidation independently from their effects on μ opiate receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3096280,20200620,5284543|5288826|5463874|5486550|70187032|72736864,103169185|123090163|194152077|194159045|194186555|194186556,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24183585,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

A bivalent ligand 1 with a 21-atom spacer was thus synthesized and explicitly characterized as a novel pharmacological probe to study the underlying mechanism of opioid-enhanced NeuroAIDS. The steric hindrance generated from the spacer affected the binding affinity and Ca(2+) flux inhibition function activity of bivalent ligand 1 at the chemokine receptor CCR5 more profoundly than it did at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, the CCR5 radioligand binding affinity and the Ca(2+) flux inhibition function of the ligand seemed not necessarily to correlate with its antiviral activity given that it was at least two times more potent than maraviroc alone in reducing Tat expression upon HIV-1 infection in human astrocytes. Furthermore, the ligand was also about two times more potent than the simple mixture of maraviroc and naltrexone in the same viral entry inhibition assay. Therefore bivalent ligand 1 seemed to function more effectively by targeting specifically the putative MOR-CCR5 heterodimer in the viral invasion process. The results reported here suggest that a properly designed bivalent ligand may serve as a useful chemical probe to study the potential MOR-CCR5 interaction during the progression of NeuroAIDS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3227483,20200619,89702731,242614425,1234|4988,,P35372|P51681,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23682308,0,,P35372|P51681,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

To study the ligand-receptor interactions that occur between salvinorin A and the KOR, a new series of salvinorin A derivatives bearing potentially reactive Michael acceptor functional groups at C-2 was synthesized and used to probe the salvinorin A binding site. The κ-, δ-, and μ-opioid receptor (KOR, DOR and MOR, respectively) binding affinities and KOR efficacies were measured for the new compounds. Although none showed wash-resistant irreversible binding, most of them showed high affinity for the KOR, and some exhibited dual affinity to KOR and MOR. Molecular modeling techniques based on the recently-determined crystal structure of the KOR combined with results from mutagenesis studies, competitive binding, functional assays and structure-activity relationships, and previous salvinorin A-KOR interaction models were used to identify putative interaction modes of the new compounds with the KOR and MOR.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3385053,20200625,128563|5462471|5497186|11487946|118713122|118713123|118713124|118713125|118713126|118713127|118713128|118713129|118713130|118713131|118713132|118713133|118713134|118713135|118713136|118713137|118713138|118713139|118713140|118713141|118713142,103217856|103457931|103458505|103697951|312356982|312356983|312356984|312356985|312356986|312356987|312356988|312356989|312356990|312356991|312356992|312356993|312356994|312356995|312356996|312356997|312356998|312356999|312357000|312357001|312357002,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25193297,0,,P35372,9606,54.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Given the absence of therapeutic options available and the significance of VEEV as a weaponized agent, an optimization effort was initiated around a quinazolinone screening hit 1 with promising cellular antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.8 μM), limited cytotoxic liability (CC50 > 50 μM), and modest in vitro efficacy in reducing viral progeny (63-fold at 5 μM). Scaffold optimization revealed a novel rearrangement affording amidines, specifically compound 45, which was found to potently inhibit several VEEV strains in the low nanomolar range without cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.02-0.04 μM, CC50 > 50 μM) while limiting in vitro viral replication (EC90 = 0.17 μM).

The vast structural diversity of this group of polyketides is largely introduced by enzymatic oxidations, which can significantly influence the bioactivity profile. Four new compounds, griseorhodins D-F, were isolated from a griseorhodin producer, Streptomyces sp. CN48+, based upon their enhancement of calcium uptake in a mouse dorsal root ganglion primary cell culture assay. Two of these compounds, griseorhodins D1 and D2, were shown to be identical to the major, previously uncharacterized products of a grhM mutant in an earlier griseorhodin biosynthesis study. Their structures enabled the establishment of a more complete hypothesis for the biosynthesis of griseorhodins and related compounds.

The competition binding assay showed two-atom spacer and aromatic side chain were optimal for MOR selectivity. Meanwhile, substitutions at the 1'- and/or 4'-position of the isoquinoline ring retained or improved MOR selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor while still possessing above 20-fold MOR selectivity over the delta opioid receptor. In contrast, substitutions at the 6'- and/or 7'-position of the isoquinoline ring reduced MOR selectivity as well as MOR efficacy. Among this series of ligands, compound 11 acted as an antagonist when challenged with morphine in warm-water tail immersion assay and produced less significant withdrawal symptoms compared to naltrexone in morphine-pelleted mice. Compound 11 also antagonized the intracellular Ca(2+) increase induced by DAMGO. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of 11 in three opioid receptors indicated orientation of the 6'-nitro group varied significantly in the different 'address' domains of the receptors and played a crucial role in the observed binding affinities and selectivity.

Designing molecules that can overcome this protection system and achieve optimal concentration at the desired therapeutic target in the brain is a specific and major challenge for medicinal chemists working in CNS drug discovery. Analogous to the now widely accepted rule of 5 in the design of oral drugs, the physicochemical properties required for optimal brain exposure have been extensively studied in an attempt to similarly define the attributes of successful CNS drugs and drug candidates. This body of work is systematically reviewed here, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between the most critical physicochemical and pharmacokinetic parameters of CNS drugs as well as their impact on medicinal chemistry strategies toward molecules with optimal brain exposure.

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor. Some analogues displayed high affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor, comparable to N-methyllaurotetanine, with moderate selectivity vs 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3582619,20181008,16573,103598424,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25695425,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

They are also employed in fluorescent binding assays. This study is centered on the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of fluorescent probes for the opioid receptors, for which relatively few non-peptidic fluorescent probes currently exist. The known μ-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist, buprenorphine, was structurally elaborated to include an amidoalkylamine linker moiety that was coupled with a range of fluorophores to afford new fluorescent probes. All compounds proved to be selective MOR antagonists. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the probe incorporating a sulfonated cyanine-5 fluorophore was the most appropriate for imaging studies. This ligand was subsequently employed in an automated fluorescence-based competition binding assay, allowing the pKi values of several well-known opioid ligands to be determined. Thus, this new probe will prove useful in future studies of MOR receptor pharmacology.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3748892,20200623,127042562|127042865|127042866|127042867|127042873|127042874,336892928|336893357|336893358|336893359|336893367|336893368,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26632862,0,,P35372,9606,,,,1,0,1,1,1,1

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented. (S)-(+)-10r is the first highly potent and selective chiral inhibitor of FAAH-COX with marked in vivo activity, and represents a promising lead to discover novel analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3779679,20200623,117072556,336877911,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26774927,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

We thus designed a series of variable-length (15-41 atoms) bivalent linked peptides with selective but moderate/low-affinity pharmacophores for the mu and delta opioid receptors. We observed a U-shaped MDOR potency/affinity profile in vitro, with the 24-atom spacer length (D24M) producing the highest MDOR potency/affinity (<1 nM) and selectivity (≥89-fold). We further evaluated D24M in mice and observed that D24M dose-dependently antagonized tail flick antinociception produced by the MDOR agonists CYM51010 and Deltorphin-II, without antagonizing the monomer agonists DAMGO and DSLET. We also observed that D24M sharply reduced withdrawal behavior in models of acute and chronic morphine dependence.

We herein report that potassium permanganate supported on iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate can be used as a convenient oxidant in the one-step, heterogeneous conversion of Δ7,8-opioids to the corresponding 7β-hydroxy-8-ketones. Details of the reaction mechanism are given and the effects of the substituent at position 6 of several opioids on the reaction outcome is discussed. The opioid hydroxy ketones prepared are antagonists at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. Docking simulations and detailed structure-activity analysis revealed that the presence of the 7β-hydroxy-8-ketone functionality in the prepared compounds can be used to gain activity towards the delta opioid receptor.

It is implicated in nociception, diuresis, emotion, cognition, and immune system functions. KOP agonists possess a strong analgesic effect accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria. On the other hand, antagonists of this receptor were found to block depression, anxiety, and drug-seeking behaviors in animal models. Recently, great interest has been given to the development of selective KOP antagonists as an addiction treatment that does not cause dependence itself or show high relapse rates like the currently used agents. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the KOP antagonists developed for this purpose together with their in vivo studies and clinical trials.

In contrast, literature examples of arylpiperazines 4 and 5 were reported to be pan opioid receptor antagonists, while 6 was a MOR agonist. Two compounds (13l and 11b) showed analgesic response in tail flick test which was blocked by pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine (norBNI).

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite. Herein we describe the discovery of second-generation HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 with increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile achieved by reduction of phase 2 metabolism. Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, the clinical pharmacokinetics for PT2977 supports the hypothesis that attenuating the rate of glucuronidation would improve exposure and reduce variability in patients. Early evidence of clinical activity shows promise for PT2977 in the treatment of ccRCC.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4312701,20210302,117947097,440223752,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31282155,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Further optimization of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters led to the identification of BAY-899 with an improved in vitro profile and proven efficacy in vivo.

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis.

This analgesic effect is mediated principally by the activation of μ-opioid receptors (MOR). However, prolonged activation of MOR also results in tolerance, dependence, addiction, constipation, nausea, sedation, and respiratory depression. To address this problem, we sought alternative ways to activate MOR - either by use of novel ligands, or via a novel activation mechanism. To this end, a series of compounds were screened using a sensitive CHO-K1/MOR/Gα15 cell-based FLIPR<sup>®</sup> calcium high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, and the bithiazole compound 5a was identified as being able activate MOR in combination with naloxone. Structural modifications of 5a resulted in the discovery of lead compound 5j, which could effectively activate MOR in combination with the MOR antagonist naloxone or naltrexone. In vivo, naloxone in combination with 100 mg/kg of compound 5j elicited antinociception in a mouse tail-flick model with an ED<sub>50</sub> of 17.5 ± 4 mg/kg. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism by which the 5j/naloxone combination activates MOR is worthy of further study, as its discovery has the potential to yield an entirely novel class of analgesics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4390963,20210302,746650,440133716,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30776693,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396144,20210302,155565189,440218835,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fragmentation of 1 revealed orthosteric fragment 5a to express an unusually low D<sub>3</sub>R affinity ( K<sub>i</sub> = 2.7 μM). Compared to piperazine congener 31, which retains a high-affinity orthosteric fragment (5d, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 23.9 nM), 1 was found to be more selective for the D<sub>3</sub>R among D<sub>1</sub>- and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors and exhibited negligible off-target interactions at serotoninergic and adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), common off-target sites for piperazine-containing D<sub>3</sub>R scaffolds.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

For example, targeting of opiod receptors by opiates such as morphine is a widespread clinical application for GPCR modulation in pain management. The recently de-orphanized GPR7 (5) is localized predominantly in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex (6), with additional expression in the pituitary, hippocampus, amygdala, and spinal cord (7-9). GPR7 is highly conserved in humans and rodents (6), and exhibits structural features of both GPCRs and somatostatin receptors (7). Studies identifying the energy-regulating neuropeptides Neuropeptide W (NPW) and Neuropeptide B (NPB) as endogenous ligands of GPR7 (5, 10), and the development of hyperphagia and obesity in male GPR7 knockout mice (11, 12), implicate GPR7 in feeding behavior. Additional studies identifying GPR7 expression in peripheral Schwann cells (13) and increased GPR7 expression in rat models and human patients with inflammation-associated neuropathic pain (11, 13), suggest a role for GPR7 in mediating the inflammatory pain response. The identification of modulators of GPR7 will provide useful tools to elucidate the diverse roles of this receptor in central neuropeptide signaling and nociception in general._||_References:_||_1.

For example, targeting of opiod receptors by opiates such as morphine is a widespread clinical application for GPCR modulation in pain management. The recently de-orphanized GPR7 (5) is localized predominantly in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex (6), with additional expression in the pituitary, hippocampus, amygdala, and spinal cord (7-9). GPR7 is highly conserved in humans and rodents (6), and exhibits structural features of both GPCRs and somatostatin receptors (7). Studies identifying the energy-regulating neuropeptides Neuropeptide W (NPW) and Neuropeptide B (NPB) as endogenous ligands of GPR7 (5, 10), and the development of hyperphagia and obesity in male GPR7 knockout mice (11, 12), implicate GPR7 in feeding behavior. Additional studies identifying GPR7 expression in peripheral Schwann cells (13) and increased GPR7 expression in rat models and human patients with inflammation-associated neuropathic pain (11, 13), suggest a role for GPR7 in mediating the inflammatory pain response. The identification of modulators of GPR7 will provide useful tools to elucidate the diverse roles of this receptor in central neuropeptide signaling and nociception in general._||_References:_||_1.

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

The lack of selective, brain-penetrant and orally active AVPR1a antagonists hampers the progress in our understanding of the precise/complete pharmacological role of AVPR1a in central nervous system disorders and the development of novel treatments for these disorders. The optimization of promising AVPR1a antagonist lead compounds and testing in known and relevant in vivo animal models will be a significant step forward in our understanding of the role of AVPR1a in CNS disorders and in the development of novel treatments of anxiety, depression and PTSD. It is estimated that over 15 million people in the USA suffer from major depression and is increasing. The current treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for which some 60% of patients do not respond [1-2]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 7-8 million people in the US that have experienced a major traumatic effect in their lifetime, this is a particular area of focus for the military where up to 30% of combatants experience PTSD on their return from a tour of duty having experienced combat (for example in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq). A significant therapeutic need, the support of pre-clinical data and the lack of brain-penetrant, orally active AVPR1a antagonists emphasize the significance of this opportunity. Our aim is to identify a novel, selective, orally bioavailable and brain penetrant AVPR1a antagonist._||_References:_||_1.
