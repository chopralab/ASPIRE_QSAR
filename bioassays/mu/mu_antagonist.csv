In contrast to topoII-targeted drugs currently in clinical use, these compounds do not act as topoII poisons that enhance enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage, a mechanism that is linked to the development of secondary leukemias. Instead, these tetrahydroquinazolines block the topoII function with no evidence of DNA intercalation. We identified a potent lead compound [compound 14 (ARN-21934) IC = 2 μM for inhibition of DNA relaxation, as compared to an IC = 120 μM for the anticancer drug etoposide] with excellent metabolic stability and solubility. This new compound also shows ~100-fold selectivity for topoIIα over topoβ, a broad antiproliferative activity toward cultured human cancer cells, a favorable in vivo pharmacokinetic profile, and the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Thus, ARN-21934 is a highly promising lead for the development of novel and potentially safer topoII-targeted anticancer drugs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4704164,20220318,135150944,461535362,4988,Cell-based,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33079544,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

However, several neurological complications are now being seen in these patients due to HIV-1 associated injury of neurons by infected microglia and astrocytes. In addition, these effects can be further exacerbated with opiate use and abuse. One possible mechanism for such potentiation effects of opiates is the interaction of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the chemokine receptor CCR5 (CCR5), a known HIV-1 co-receptor, to form MOR-CCR5 heterodimer. In an attempt to understand this putative interaction and its relevance to neuroAIDS, we designed and synthesized a series of bivalent ligands targeting the putative CCR5-MOR heterodimer. To understand how these bivalent ligands may interact with the heterodimer, biological studies including calcium mobilization inhibition, binding affinity, HIV-1 invasion, and cell fusion assays were applied. In particular, HIV-1 infection assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and astrocytes revealed a notable synergy in activity for one particular bivalent ligand. Further, a molecular model of the putative CCR5-MOR heterodimer was constructed, docked with the bivalent ligand, and molecular dynamics simulations of the complex was performed in a membrane-water system to help understand the biological observation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4719349,20220318,5360515|71460188|90666576|162645606|162650661|162660215|162660784|162674876,131283791|163333807|242614426|461518223|461525405|461538971|461539772|461559880,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27720326,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

In contrast, our systematic SAR studies on [des-Arg]Dyn A analogues found that Arg is not a key residue and even deletion of the residue does not affect biological activities at the KOR. In addition, it was also found that [des-Arg]Dyn A(1-9)-NH is a minimum pharmacophore and its modification at the N-terminus leads to selective KOR antagonists.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series.

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series.

This drug also possesses potent activity at several other brain receptors (most notably alpha 1 adrenergic receptors). We have prepared the enantiomers and diastereomers of ifenprodil along with a series of partial structures in order to explore the basic structure activity relations within this class of compounds. From this study, it is clear that alpha 1 adrenergic and NMDA receptor activities may be separated by selection of the threo relative stereochemistry. Examination of the optical isomers of threo-ifenprodil (2) reveals that no further improvement in receptor selectivity is gained from either antipode. Individual removal of most of the structural fragments from the ifenprodil molecule generally results in less active compounds although fluorinated derivative 9 with threo relative stereochemistry is somewhat more potent and substantially more selective for the NMDA receptor. Finally a minimum structure for activity in this series (14) has been identified. This stripped-down version of ifenprodil possesses nearly equivalent affinity for the NMDA receptor with no selectivity over alpha 1 adrenergic receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755061,20181013,3689,124960908,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1681106,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However in this series of 14beta-cinnamoylamino derivatives the codeinones (e.g. methoclocinnamox, MC-CAM) had unexpectedly high mu-opioid receptor affinity, similar to that of the morphinone (clocinnamox, C-CAM). The current report relates to the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of deoxyclocinnamox (DOC-CAM) which acted as a high-affinity opioid antagonist similar to C-CAM but with greater mu selectivity.

For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons.

In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873929,20181017,443408|5480230|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734675|103735456,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P35372,9527,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These modified Dmt-Tic peptides showed binding affinities as low as 2.5 nM with up to 500-fold selectivity for the delta versus mu opioid receptor and proved to be delta receptor antagonists.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757307,20180929,10412617|15384271|44292142|44292280|44292281|44292403|44292414|44292426|44292437|71449173|71452786|71454553|71454554|71456308|71456309|71458116|71458142|71459993|71460019,103228158|103228335|103228480|103228481|103228753|103228769|103228805|103228839|103700766|163312781|163319622|163323071|163323072|163326516|163326519|163329890|163329951|163333487|163333544,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10673103,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757310,20181016,132913|134131,103310030|103310529,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Modified tetrahydroisoquinoline (Tiq) residues were reacted with different electrophiles in order to create novel molecules that would mimic the original dipeptide. A specific class of thioureas bearing basic pyrrolidine residues were shown to give good binding affinities. Further alkylation of the pyrrolidine ring with benzyl derivatives also proved to increase the mu binding affinity. In addition, it was demonstrated that mu binding was enhanced by the presence of polar groups around the benzyl ring having hydrogen-bonding character (donor/acceptor).

New potent and selective GABAB agonists._||_Abstract: The antispastic agent and muscle relaxant baclofen 1 is a potent and selective agonist for bicuculline-insensitive GABAB receptors. For many years efforts to obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by replacing the carboxylic acid group of GABA or baclofen derivatives with either the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity relationships of the novel GABAB agonists are discussed with respect to their affinities to GABAB receptors as well as to their effects in many functional tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756441,20181014,6335948,103334995,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650684,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
152091,Literature-derived,Inhibition of [3H]naloxone binding to mu-opiate receptor of central nervous system,"Title: Phosphinic acid analogues of GABA. 2. Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys. The novel GABAB antagonists showed also protective effects in various animal models of absence epilepsy.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL884858,20181014,130021,103335975,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650685,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Analysis of the metabolites of 1 revealed that 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine is formed as the major metabolite and is an agonist at the mu-opioid receptor. To circumvent any potential liability resulting from the metabolite, we decided to identify alternate templates devoid of agonist activity at the mu-opioid receptor to replace the 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety. The present study describes the synthesis and SAR of dihydropyrimidinones linked to substituted 4-phenylpiperazine containing side chains. Compound (+)-38 was identified as a lead compound with a binding and functional profile comparable to that of 1.

Approaches to eliminate opioid agonist metabolites via modification of linker and 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety._||_Abstract: We have previously described compound 1a as a high-affinity subtype selective alpha(1a) antagonist. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of compound 1a showed its major metabolite to be a mu-opioid agonist, 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine (3). Several dihydropyrimidinone analogues were synthesized with the goal of either minimizing the formation of 3 by modification of the linker or finding alternative piperidine moieties which when cleaved as a consequence of metabolism would not give rise to mu-opioid activity. Modification of the linker gave several compounds with good alpha(1a) binding affinity (K(i) = < 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d)). In vitro analysis in the microsomal assay revealed these modifications did not significantly affect N-dealkylation and the formation of the piperidine 3. The second approach, however, yielded several piperidine replacements for 3, which did not show significant mu-opioid activity. Several of these compounds maintained good affinity at the alpha(1a) adrenoceptor and selectivity over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d). For example, the piperidine fragments of (+)-73 and (+)-83, viz. 4-cyano-4-phenylpiperidine and 4-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine, were essentially inactive at the mu-opioid receptor (IC(50) > 30 microM vs 3 microM for 3). Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 were subjected to detailed in vitro and in vivo characterization. Both these compounds, in addition to their excellent selectivity (>880-fold) over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d), also showed good selectivity over several other recombinant human G-protein coupled receptors. Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 showed good functional potency in isolated human prostate tissues, with K(b)s comparable to their in vitro alpha(1a) binding data. In addition, compound (+)-73 also exhibited good uroselectivity (DBP K(b)/IUP K(b) > 20-fold) in the in vivo experiments in dogs, similar to 1a.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758204,20181016,10099811,103385729,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10579841,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The compounds in this new series contain a thiazole moiety linking an aromatic group and a nitrogen-containing basic region; the thiazole group appears to be acting as a carbonyl bioisostere in this system. An optimized member of this series, 4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-2-[[4(5)-methyl-5(4)-imidazolyl]methyl]thiazole (5), exhibits oral activity in the Bezold-Jarisch reflex paradigm comparable to or better than the standard agents ondansetron (1) and ICS-205-930 (2).

Docking studies with 3-D models of the hNK-3 and hNK-2 receptors were used to drive the chemical design and speed up the identification of potent and combined antagonsits at both receptors. (S)-(+)-N-(1-Cyclohexylethyl)-3-[(4-morpholin-4-yl)piperidin-1-yl]methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide (compound 25, SB-400238: hNK-3R binding affinity, K(i) = 0.8 nM; hNK-2R binding affinity, K(i) = 0.8 nM) emerged as the best example in this approach. Further studies led to the identification of (S)-(+)-N-(1,2,2-trimethylpropyl)-3-[(4-piperidin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide (compound 28, SB-414240: hNK-3R binding affinity, K(i) = 193 nM; hNK-2R binding affinity, K(i) = 1.0 nM) as the first hNK-2R-selective antagonist belonging to the 2-phenylquinoline chemical class. Since some members of this chemical series showed a significant binding affinity for the human mu-opioid receptor (hMOR), docking studies were also conducted on a 3-D model of the hMOR, resulting in the identification of a viable chemical strategy to avoid any significant micro-opioid component. Compounds 25 and 28 are therefore suitable pharmacological tools in the tachykinin area to elucidate further the pathophysiological role of NK-3 and NK-2 receptors and the therapeutic potential of selective NK-2 (28) or combined NK-3 and NK-2 (25) receptor antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757458,20181017,9828448,103228091,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11356103,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor. The lack of correlation between the pharmacological profiles observed in smooth muscle and in the brain binding assays suggests the existence of different subtypes of the kappa and mu opioid receptors in the brain and peripheral nervous systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756022,20181012,10102939|10677974|15160017|16133805|25079852|25087514|25087515|25087516,103173862|103241413|103241617|103241618|103241619|103241662|103241663|103241664,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1972964,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1
224713,Confirmatory,Tested for binding activity against mu opioid receptor using [3H]DAMGO ligand,"Title: Synthesis of naltrexone-derived delta-opioid antagonists. Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors. Analogues (3 and 6-8) which were shown to have relatively weak delta-opioid receptor antagonist potency have their aromatic groups located in a space that is different from that of the more potent analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL843459,20181014,5310988|5491688|5497186|6438353|46877673|46877674|46877676|46877677,103316748|103556473|103697951|103734768|103734769|103734771|103734772|103734773,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8126697,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
226077,Literature-derived,Potency against opioid receptor relative to morphine,"Title: Opioid agonist and antagonist activities of peripherally selective derivatives of naltrexamine and oxymorphamine._||_Abstract: A series of beta-naltrexamine and beta-oxymorphamine derivatives that contain ionizable moieties coupled to the 6 beta-amino group were synthesized in an effort to develop antagonists and agonists that have negligible access into the central nervous system (CNS). Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS. Such ligands may be useful pharmacologic tools for investigation of peripheral opioid mechanisms. Moreover, they could find clinical applications when the central actions are unwanted.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL845234,20200628,13894004,163333212,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2475628,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

N,N-Dialkylated and N-monoalkylated (alkyl = allyl, benzyl, and cyclopropylmethyl (CPM) tyrosine derivatives were prepared from tyrosine tert-butyl ester and the corresponding alkyl halides. [D-Pro10]Dyn A-(2-11) was prepared by solid phase synthesis using Fmoc-protected amino acids, and the tyrosine derivatives were coupled to the peptide with BOP ((benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate). Both the degree of substitution and the identity of the alkyl group affected kappa-receptor affinity, selectivity, and efficacy. All of the N-monoalkylated derivatives exhibited much higher affinity (Ki < 0.05 nM) for kappa receptors in the guinea pig cerebellum and greatly enhanced kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu) > 200) compared to the N,N-dialkyl [D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11) analogues, although one disubstituted analogue, N,N-diCPM[D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11), retained high affinity (Ki = 0.19 nM) for kappa receptors. Thus the introduction of the second alkyl group at the N-terminus lowered kappa-receptor affinity and selectivity.

231577,Literature-derived,Receptor selectivity index is the ratio of the apparent KI at mu opioid receptor over the apparent KI at the highest affinity site,"Title: Synthesis and biological activities of dynorphin A analogues with opioid antagonist properties._||_Abstract: Dynorphin A, which displays a wide variety of physiological effects, binds to opioid receptors preferentially at the kappa receptor type. kappa-selective antagonists would be very useful as pharmacological and biochemical probes to study and better understand the action of dynorphin A at its preferred receptor. However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852600,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These results indicate that a positively charged N-terminal amino group may be essential for signal transduction but not for receptor binding and suggested that its deletion in agonist opioid peptides containing an N-terminal 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) residue may represent a general way to convert them into antagonists. In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group. This was achieved by replacement of Tyr(1) with 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp]. Compounds were tested in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens bioassays and in rat and guinea pig brain membrane receptor binding assays. All analogues turned out to be potent kappa antagonists against Dyn A(1-13) and the non-peptide agonist U50,488 and showed only weak mu and delta antagonist activity. The most potent and most selective kappa antagonist of the series was [(2S)-Mdp(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (5, dynantin), which showed subnanomolar kappa antagonist potency against Dyn A(1-13) and very high kappa selectivity both in terms of its K(e) values determined against kappa, mu, and delta agonists and in terms of its ratios of kappa, mu, and delta receptor binding affinity constants.

The methyloctahydroisoquinolines 6a-g can exist in conformations where the 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent is either axial or equatorial, similar to the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines 4. The 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is responsible for the antagonist activity observed in the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine antagonists. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 6a shows that the 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is favored in the solid state. Molecular modeling studies also suggest that the equatorial conformation has lower potential energy relative to that of the axial conformation. Evaluation of 6a-g in the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S in vitro functional assay showed that they were opioid receptor pure antagonists.

Further separation of two distinct chiral racemic compounds into their corresponding pairs of enantiomers revealed a considerable selectivity for MCHr1 for one configuration, in addition to a striking difference in oral exposure between one pair of enantiomers in diet-induced obese mice. Oral administration of the most potent compound in this class in the same animal model led to significant reduction of fat mass in a semi-chronic model for weight loss.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL907669,20181021,16721015,103502517,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17188866,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3. One of the active constrained analogues, compound 4, exhibited subnanomolar mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.62 nM) and potent mu-opioid antagonist activity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM). On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed. In these compounds the octahydroquinolizine template of 4 was replaced by an octahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine scaffold. The new derivatives were tested for their binding affinities and in vitro functional activity against the cloned human mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. From this study, we identified compound 36, which displays high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.47 nM), potent mu in vitro antagonist activity (IC(50) = 1.8 nM) and improved binding selectivity profile mu/kappa and mu/delta, when compared to 4.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909854,20181021,16094396|16094409|16094423|16094427|16094431,103503651|103503676|103503703|103503710|103503717,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149859,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

On the basis of its high delta selectivity, H-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH (reference compound 1) is a useful starting point for the synthesis of (18)F-labeled compounds prepared by the coupling of N-succinimidyl 4-[ (18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) with Boc-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH under slightly basic conditions at 37 degrees C for 15 min, deprotection with TFA, and HPLC purification. The total synthesis time was 120 min, and the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [(18)F]- 1 was about 25-30% ( n = 5) starting from [(18)F]SFB ( n = 5) with an effective specific activity about 46 GBq/micromol. In vitro autoradiography studies showed prominent uptake of [ (18)F]- 1 in the striatum and cortex with significant blocking by 1 and UFP-501 (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), suggesting high specific binding of [(18)F]- 1 to delta-opioid receptors. Noninvasive microPET imaging studies revealed the absence of [(18)F]- 1 in rat brain, since it fails to cross the blood-brain barrier. This study demonstrates the suitability of [ (18)F]- 1 for imaging peripheral delta-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL950325,20181023,71720208,164147222,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18311909,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Introduction of 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) instead of Tyr(1) led to obtaining [Dmt(1), (R)-Nip(2)]EM-2 which showed exceptional MOR affinity and high stability against enzymatic degradation in rat brain homogenate. In in vivo hot-plate test in mice, this analog given intracerebroventicularly (i.c.v.), produced profound supraspinal analgesia, being much more potent than EM-2.

We conducted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies on COS cells coexpressing MOP and CCK2 receptors to determine whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in such modulation. These studies revealed the absence of constitutive or monovalent ligand-induced heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of MOP and CCK2 receptors therefore is unlikely to be responsible for the opposing effects between morphine and CCK in the CNS. However, association was induced, as indicated by a positive BRET signal, on exposure of the cells to bivalent ligands containing mu-opioid agonist and CCK2 receptor antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers containing 16-22 atoms but not with a shorter (9-atom) spacer. These studies demonstrate for the first time that an appropriately designed bivalent ligand is capable of inducing association of G-protein-coupled receptors.

Using pharmacophore analysis, we designed and synthesized compounds which bind to both serotonin receptor subtype 1A (5-HT(1A)) and subtype 3 (5-HT(3)). Quinazolinone derivatives with a sulfur atom in the linker showed high affinity in in vitro assays, but low in vivo activity. Focusing on the linker to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, the sulfur atom in the linker was replaced with a methylene group. Further optimization led to the discovery of compound 17m (TZB-30878) ( J. Pharmacol. Exp.

The value of the adamantyl group in drug design is multidimensional. The hydrophobic substituent constant for the adamantyl group has been estimated from the calculated partition coefficients (clogP values) of 31 adamantyl-bearing compounds in the clinic or in development as πadamantyl=3.1, which indicates that the logP value of a compound with high water solubility (logP<<0) could be moved with an adamantyl-based modification to a region that is more clinically useful. The steric bulk of the adamantyl group can: (i) restrict or modulate intramolecular reactivity; and (ii) impede the access of hydrolytic enzymes, thereby increasing drug stability and plasma half life. The value of the adamantyl group in drug design has been recognized most recently in the design of agents to treat iron overload disease (in development), malaria (in clinical trials) and type 2 diabetes (in the clinic).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2174528,20200625,10529438,103390432,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21354674,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

A C4a-phenethyl derivative 2a, was found to have modest receptor affinity both at μ- (K(i)=60 nM) and δ-opioid receptors (K(i)=64 nM). The N-methyl substituent of 2a and that of other ligands in the series was then modified to obtain compounds with different N-substituents that might provide higher affinity at both receptors. A number of compounds differently substituted at C4a and N were synthesized and evaluated. Binding studies and functional assays revealed a moderately selective δ-antagonist (2l), selective μ-δ antagonists (3d, 3g), and a μ-κ antagonist (3f).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2390780,20200629,44311043|44311351,103268859|174510210,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23618710,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A high throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, led to the discovery of a non-peptidic β-arrestin biased agonist for NTR1. The lead compound, 2-cyclopropyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- piperazin-1-yl)quinazoline, 32 (ML314), exhibits full agonist behavior against NTR1 (EC50 = 2.0 μM) in the primary assay and selectivity against NTR2. The effect of 32 is blocked by the NTR1 antagonist SR142948A in a dose dependent manner. Unlike peptide based NTR1 agonists, compound 32 has no significant response in a Ca(2+) mobilization assay and is thus a biased agonist that activates the β-arrestin pathway rather than the traditional G q coupled pathway. This bias has distinct biochemical and functional consequences that may lead to physiological advantages. Compound 32 displays good brain penetration in rodents, and studies examining its in vivo properties are underway.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2433825,20200629,53245590,174498737,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24611085,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In contrast to these findings we report in this study that addition of a 7α-amino (5a), 7α-alkylamino (5b-e), or 7α-dialkylamino (5f-h) group to 4 leads to opioid receptor ligands with varying degrees of agonist/antagonist activity. The 7α-amino and 7α-methylamino analogues were full agonists at the μ and δ receptors and antagonists at the κ receptor. The 7α-cyclopropylmethylamino analogue 5h was a full agonist at the μ receptor with weaker agonist activity at the δ and κ receptors. Whereas the addition of a 7α-acylamino group to the pure nonselective opioid receptor antagonist N-phenylpropyl-4β-methyl-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan (4) led to κ selective pure opioid receptor antagonist, the addition of a 7α-amino, 7α-alkylamino, or 7α-dialkylamino group to 4 leads to opioid ligands that are largely μ or δ agonist with mixed agonist/antagonist properties.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3088916,20200620,76324412,194165723,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24144404,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

The first-generation ligands appeared to be MOR-selective, whereas the second and the third generation ones showed MOR/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) dual selectivity. Docking of ligands 2 (MOR selective) and 10 (MOR/KOR dual selective) to the three opioid receptor crystal structures revealed a nonconserved-residue-facilitated hydrogen-bonding network that could be responsible for their distinctive selectivity profiles. The MOR/KOR dual-selective ligand 10 showed no agonism and acted as a potent antagonist in the tail-flick assay. It also produced less severe opioid withdrawal symptoms than naloxone in morphine-dependent mice. In conclusion, ligand 10 may serve as a novel lead compound to develop MOR/KOR dual-selective ligands, which might possess unique therapeutic value for opioid addiction treatment.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3089529,20180928,5360515|76309826|76309827|76309828|76313542|76313543|76313544|76317053|76317054|76317055|76317056|76317057|76320762|76327982|76331634|76331635|76331636|76335253|76335254|76335255,131283791|194138077|194138078|194138079|194144969|194144970|194144971|194151804|194151805|194151806|194151807|194151808|194158776|194172609|194179436|194179437|194179438|194186277|194186278|194186279,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24144240,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A bivalent ligand 1 with a 21-atom spacer was thus synthesized and explicitly characterized as a novel pharmacological probe to study the underlying mechanism of opioid-enhanced NeuroAIDS. The steric hindrance generated from the spacer affected the binding affinity and Ca(2+) flux inhibition function activity of bivalent ligand 1 at the chemokine receptor CCR5 more profoundly than it did at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, the CCR5 radioligand binding affinity and the Ca(2+) flux inhibition function of the ligand seemed not necessarily to correlate with its antiviral activity given that it was at least two times more potent than maraviroc alone in reducing Tat expression upon HIV-1 infection in human astrocytes. Furthermore, the ligand was also about two times more potent than the simple mixture of maraviroc and naltrexone in the same viral entry inhibition assay. Therefore bivalent ligand 1 seemed to function more effectively by targeting specifically the putative MOR-CCR5 heterodimer in the viral invasion process. The results reported here suggest that a properly designed bivalent ligand may serve as a useful chemical probe to study the potential MOR-CCR5 interaction during the progression of NeuroAIDS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3227490,20181002,5360515|89702731|90666576,131283791|242614425|242614426,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23682308,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285644,20200618,5748589|90678812|90678813,242640973|242640974|242640975,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Currently, no small molecules displaying good affinity or selectivity for either subtype have been reported, to decipher the role of NPFF2-R as it relates to opioid-mediated analgesia, for further exploration of NPFF1-R, or for medication development for either subtype. We report the first nonpeptide small molecule scaffold for NPFF1,2-R, the guanidino-piperidines, and SAR studies resulting in the discovery of a NPFF1 agonist (7b, K(i) = 487 ± 117 nM), a NPFF1 antagonist (46, K(i) = 81 ± 17 nM), and a NPFF2 partial antagonist (53a, K(i) = 30 ± 5 nM), which serve as leads for the development of pharmacological probes and potential therapeutic agents.

These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

These shifts in functional activity are often accompanied by negligible changes in binding affinity. The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest.

Despite this, identification of a potent small molecule tool possessing pharmacokinetic properties allowing for robust in vivo target coverage has been challenging. Here we describe the optimization of a potent, selective series of quinazolinone-based TRPA1 antagonists. High-throughput screening identified 4, which possessed promising potency and selectivity. A strategy focused on optimizing potency while increasing polarity in order to improve intrinsic clearance culminated with the discovery of purinone 27 (AM-0902), which is a potent, selective antagonist of TRPA1 with pharmacokinetic properties allowing for >30-fold coverage of the rat TRPA1 IC50 in vivo.

Although NTI-type compound 8 and quinoline compound 9 with C-homomorphinan scaffold exhibited lower affinities and selectivities for the δ receptor than the corresponding morphinan derivatives did, both the binding affinity and selectivity for the δ receptor of BNTX-type compound 12 with a seven-membered C-ring were improved compared with the corresponding compounds with a six-membered C-ring including BNTX itself.

A set of spirocyclic cyclohexanes with diverse O-heterocycles and amino moieties (general structure III) was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated. In structure-activity relationships studies, the σ1 receptor affinity and σ1:σ2 selectivity were correlated with the stereochemistry, the kind and substitution pattern of the O-heterocycle, and the substituents at the exocyclic amino moiety. cis-configured 2-benzopyran cis-11b bearing a methoxy group and a tertiary cyclohexylmethylamino moiety showed the highest σ1 affinity ( Ki = 1.9 nM) of this series of compounds. In a Ca2+ influx assay, cis-11b behaved as a σ1 antagonist. cis-11b reveals high selectivity over σ2 and opioid receptors. The interactions of the novel σ1 ligands were analyzed on the molecular level using the recently reported X-ray crystal structure of the σ1 receptor protein. The protonated amino moiety forms a persistent salt bridge with E172. The spiro[benzopyran-1,1'-cyclohexane] scaffold and the cyclohexylmethyl moiety occupy two hydrophobic pockets.

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM).

Gastrointestinal dysfunction is an additional serious consequence of opioid use, and this can be treated with a localized drug distribution of a non-CNS penetrant, peripherally restricted opioid receptor antagonist.

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain.

Increasingly bulky enantiomeric N-alkyl homologs were prepared until their interaction with the sigma 1 receptor decreased and their insolubility became a hindrance to their evaluation in vivo and/or in vitro. The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755060,20200628,5360515|46877642,103734702|131283791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757366,20181017,443408|5480230|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734675|103735456,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P35372,9527,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Peptides extended at the C-terminus with residues which can be used as handles for further modification and/or labeling (i.e. Asx, Glx, and Lys) were synthesized. The TIPP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives exhibited similar delta-receptor affinity to TIPP (K(i) = 5-10 nM vs K(i) = 6 nM), and neither the location of the carboxylic acid moiety nor the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue significantly affected the delta-receptor affinity of these derivatives. Extension of TIPP with an additional residue did not increase mu-receptor affinity, even though the position of the acidic group, which imparts delta-receptor selectivity to TIPP, was shifted relative to the carboxylic acid moiety of TIPP. The delta-receptor affinities of the TIP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives were found to be influenced mainly by the position of the carboxylic acid function rather than the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue. TIP(P)-D/L-Lys(Ac)-OH derivatives exhibited moderate delta-receptor affinity (K(i)(delta) = 16-28 nM).

Approaches to eliminate opioid agonist metabolites via modification of linker and 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety._||_Abstract: We have previously described compound 1a as a high-affinity subtype selective alpha(1a) antagonist. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of compound 1a showed its major metabolite to be a mu-opioid agonist, 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine (3). Several dihydropyrimidinone analogues were synthesized with the goal of either minimizing the formation of 3 by modification of the linker or finding alternative piperidine moieties which when cleaved as a consequence of metabolism would not give rise to mu-opioid activity. Modification of the linker gave several compounds with good alpha(1a) binding affinity (K(i) = < 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d)). In vitro analysis in the microsomal assay revealed these modifications did not significantly affect N-dealkylation and the formation of the piperidine 3. The second approach, however, yielded several piperidine replacements for 3, which did not show significant mu-opioid activity. Several of these compounds maintained good affinity at the alpha(1a) adrenoceptor and selectivity over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d). For example, the piperidine fragments of (+)-73 and (+)-83, viz. 4-cyano-4-phenylpiperidine and 4-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine, were essentially inactive at the mu-opioid receptor (IC(50) > 30 microM vs 3 microM for 3). Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 were subjected to detailed in vitro and in vivo characterization. Both these compounds, in addition to their excellent selectivity (>880-fold) over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d), also showed good selectivity over several other recombinant human G-protein coupled receptors. Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 showed good functional potency in isolated human prostate tissues, with K(b)s comparable to their in vitro alpha(1a) binding data.

New potent and selective GABAB agonists._||_Abstract: The antispastic agent and muscle relaxant baclofen 1 is a potent and selective agonist for bicuculline-insensitive GABAB receptors. For many years efforts to obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by replacing the carboxylic acid group of GABA or baclofen derivatives with either the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity relationships of the novel GABAB agonists are discussed with respect to their affinities to GABAB receptors as well as to their effects in many functional tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756442,20181014,5230|5310933,103334318|103334994,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650684,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758205,20181016,5360515,131283791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

228142,Literature-derived,"Binding affinity towards human kappa,mu,delta receptors was calculated as the ratio; 1/0.10/0.022","Title: Structure-activity relationships of dynorphin a analogues modified in the address sequence._||_Abstract: The peptide [Pro3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 2 exhibits high affinity (K(i) = 2.4 nM) and over 2000-fold selectivity for the opioid receptor. Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM).

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

Centrally administered ghrelin has been shown to cause hunger and increase food intake in rodents. Inhibition of ghrelin actions with ghrelin antibody, peptidyl GHS-R antagonists, and antisense oligonucleosides resulted in weight loss and food intake decrease in rodents. Here we report the effects of GHS-R antagonists, some of which were potent, selective, and orally bioavailable.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor.

Three of the 10 compounds, (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-9-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl-2-phenylethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10), (1R,5S)-(+)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methylene-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S)-(+)-14), and (1R,5S,9R)-(-)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methyl-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S,9R)-(+)-15) had subnanomolar affinity at mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.19, 0.19, and 0.63 nM, respectively). The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point.

381434,Literature-derived,Effect on mu opioid dependent JNK phosphorylation in U50488 treated HEK293 cells expressing GFP tagged mu opioid receptor at 10 uM after 1 hr,"Title: Long-acting kappa opioid antagonists disrupt receptor signaling and produce noncompetitive effects by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase._||_Abstract: Norbinaltorphimine (NorBNI), guanidinonaltrindole, and atrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine (JDTic) are selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists having very long durations of action in vivo despite binding non-covalently in vitro and having only moderately high affinities. Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14-21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later. Protection by a rapidly cleared reagent indicates that norBNI did not persist at the site of action. In vitro binding of [(3)H]U69,593 to KOR showed that K(d) and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact. Consistent with the concept that the long-lasting effects might be caused by a functional disruption of KOR signaling, both norBNI and JDTic were found to stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing KOR-GFP but not in untransfected cells. Similarly, norBNI increased phospho-JNK in both the striatum and spinal cord in wild type mice but not in KOR knock-out mice. Pretreatment of mice with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 before norBNI attenuated the long acting antagonism. Together, these results suggest that the long duration KOR antagonists disrupt KOR signaling by activating JNK.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL977786,20181025,5480230,103698780,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17702750,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In order to investigate structural requirements for position 2, we synthesized endomorphin analogs incorporating, instead of Pro, unnatural amino acids with six-membered heterocyclic rings, such as piperidine 2-, 3- or 4-carboxylic acids (Pip, Nip and Inp, respectively). (R)-Nip residue turned out to be favourable for improving MOR affinity. Introduction of 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) instead of Tyr(1) led to obtaining [Dmt(1), (R)-Nip(2)]EM-2 which showed exceptional MOR affinity and high stability against enzymatic degradation in rat brain homogenate. In in vivo hot-plate test in mice, this analog given intracerebroventicularly (i.c.v.), produced profound supraspinal analgesia, being much more potent than EM-2.

We conducted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies on COS cells coexpressing MOP and CCK2 receptors to determine whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in such modulation. These studies revealed the absence of constitutive or monovalent ligand-induced heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of MOP and CCK2 receptors therefore is unlikely to be responsible for the opposing effects between morphine and CCK in the CNS. However, association was induced, as indicated by a positive BRET signal, on exposure of the cells to bivalent ligands containing mu-opioid agonist and CCK2 receptor antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers containing 16-22 atoms but not with a shorter (9-atom) spacer. These studies demonstrate for the first time that an appropriately designed bivalent ligand is capable of inducing association of G-protein-coupled receptors. The finding that opioid tolerance studies with these ligands in mice showed no correlation with the BRET data is consistent with the absence of association of MOP and CCK2 receptors in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1021530,20181026,5462471|44580898|44580899|44580900|44580901|44580932,103217856|103628240|103628241|103628242|103628243|103628328,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19113864,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl.

Here we describe the isolation and pharmacological characterization of four novel, neurologically active purines 1-4, isolated from Haplosclerida sponges collected in the Republic of Palau. The structures were determined by analyses of spectral and X-ray data. Compound 1 induced convulsions upon intracerebroventricular injection into mice, with a CD50 value of 2.4 nmol/mouse. Purines 2-4 were active in mouse bioassays at higher doses. The seizurogenic activity of 1 was correlated with inhibition of neuronal GABAergic transmission, with only a modest impact on excitatory signaling, in electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons. Despite having a purine template structure, the inhibitory activity of 1 was not prevented by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Thus, 1 represents a novel substituted purine that elicits convulsions through its actions on inhibitory neurotransmission.

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640636,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1764074,20200629,5311340|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|131271836|131271837|131271839|131271840|131271841|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277788|131277789|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281858|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131287148,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays.

The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity.

However, a variety of adverse effects were associated with them, partially due to their relatively low MOR selectivity. NAP, a 6β-N-4'-pyridyl substituted naltrexamine derivative, was identified previously as a potent and highly selective MOR antagonist mainly acting within the peripheral nervous system. The noticeable diarrhea associated with it prompted the design and synthesis of its analogues in order to study its structure-activity relationship. Among them, compound 8 showed improved pharmacological profiles compared to the original lead, acting mainly at peripheral while increasing the intestinal motility in morphine-pelleted mice (ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg).

Several characteristics of these compounds suggest a classic 'opioid' mechanism of action: nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors, competitive interaction with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, and two-way analgesic cross-tolerance with morphine.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399076,20200629,5360515|68867300|71680922|71680923|71680924|71681076|71681077|71681078|71681079,131283791|174491695|174491696|174496752|174507179|174512307|174517359|174517360|174522568,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

A high throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, led to the discovery of a non-peptidic β-arrestin biased agonist for NTR1. The lead compound, 2-cyclopropyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- piperazin-1-yl)quinazoline, 32 (ML314), exhibits full agonist behavior against NTR1 (EC50 = 2.0 μM) in the primary assay and selectivity against NTR2. The effect of 32 is blocked by the NTR1 antagonist SR142948A in a dose dependent manner. Unlike peptide based NTR1 agonists, compound 32 has no significant response in a Ca(2+) mobilization assay and is thus a biased agonist that activates the β-arrestin pathway rather than the traditional G q coupled pathway.

Y2 receptor is the most abundant Y subtype receptor in the central nervous system and implicated with food intake, bone formation, affective disorders, alcohol and drugs of abuse, epilepsy, pain, and cancer. The lack of small molecule non-peptidic Y2 receptor modulators suitable as in vivo pharmacological tools hampered the progress to uncover the precise pharmacological role of Y2.

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425016,20181006,219077,103399782,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These include the potential for receptor selectivity, maintenance of the temporal and spatial fidelity of signaling in vivo, the ceiling effect of the allosteric cooperativity which may prevent overdose issues, and engendering bias by differentially modulating distinct signaling pathways. Here we describe the discovery, synthesis, and molecular pharmacology of δ-opioid receptor-selective positive allosteric modulators (δ PAMs). These δ PAMs increase the affinity and/or efficacy of the orthosteric agonists leu-enkephalin, SNC80 and TAN67, as measured by receptor binding, G protein activation, β-arrestin recruitment, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation.

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed. Compounds with a phenolic 4-hydroxy group do not form the hydrogen bond with His291, an important residue for KOP affinity and agonist activity. The size of the N-substituent hosted by the hydrophobic pocket formed by Val108, Ile316 and Tyr320 considerably influences binding and selectivity, with the n-alkyl size limit being five carbon atoms, while bulky substituents turn KOP agonists in antagonists. Thus, combination of experimental and molecular modeling strategies provides an initial framework for understanding the structural features of diphenethylamines that are essential to promote binding affinity and selectivity for the KOP receptor, and may be involved in transduction of the ligand binding event into molecular changes, ultimately leading to receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3858679,20200624,122589952|134139387|134147031,374283991|374295165|374322756,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27567368,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We thus designed a series of variable-length (15-41 atoms) bivalent linked peptides with selective but moderate/low-affinity pharmacophores for the mu and delta opioid receptors. We observed a U-shaped MDOR potency/affinity profile in vitro, with the 24-atom spacer length (D24M) producing the highest MDOR potency/affinity (<1 nM) and selectivity (≥89-fold). We further evaluated D24M in mice and observed that D24M dose-dependently antagonized tail flick antinociception produced by the MDOR agonists CYM51010 and Deltorphin-II, without antagonizing the monomer agonists DAMGO and DSLET.

However, direct evidence for the spontaneous formation of OR dimers in living cells under physiological conditions is missing. Despite a growing interest in the κ opioid receptor (KOR), KOR-selective fluorescent probes are particularly scarce in the literature. Herein, we present the first set of fluorescent KOR-selective probes with antagonistic properties.

Based on a combination approach, a series of 4-benzyl-4-(dimethylamino)piperidinyl analogues were designed, synthesized and evaluated for their receptor activities. Among them, compound 49 exhibited the most promising dual-acting activity toward TRPV1 and the mu-opioid receptor in vitro. In vivo,49 displayed potent, dose-dependent antinociceptive activity in both the 1st and 2nd phases in the formalin assay. Consistent with its postulated mechanism, we confirmed that in vivo, as in vitro, compound 49 both antagonized TRPV1 and functioned as a mu-opioid agonist. This result indicates that dual-acting TRPV1 antagonist/mu-opioid ligands can be made and represent a new and promising class of analgesic.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4408647,20210302,5288826|24970014|155510378|155513383|155513602|155515945|155520217|155524179|155525545|155525842|155527289|155535201|155538186|155539728|155548389|155556993|155559739|155562884,103169185|440109306|440114069|440114391|440117963|440124559|440130682|440132726|440133186|440135427|440147451|440152039|440155461|440176634|440198182|440205110|440213126|440223147,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31472474,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies.

Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent. Finding a specific agent that increase KCC2 function would potentially have therapeutic value, as increased KCC2 function reduces susceptibility to epileptic seizures.",23,Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening Facility,ED001_Antag_MDS,20090528,25067404,56405461,134|135|140|146|150|153|154|623|624|1128|1129|1131|1134|1136|1812|1813|1814|1815|1909|1910|2099|2550|2908|3269|3274|3350|3757|4543|4886|4887|4985|4986|4988|5734|6530|6531|6532|6869|10280|10800|14811|16177|24173|24208|24408|24410|25265|25399|29336|29412|29559|29709|81574|81812|83612|84109|257648|306255|101823647,,AAD14378|NP_000015|NP_000070|NP_000106|NP_000116|NP_000229|NP_000515|NP_000614|NP_000665|NP_000666|NP_000669|NP_000672|NP_000675|NP_000701|NP_000729|NP_000730|NP_000731|NP_000734|NP_000785|NP_000787|NP_000788|NP_000900|NP_000901|NP_000902|NP_000903|NP_000905|NP_000949|NP_001018087|NP_001034|NP_001035|NP_001036|NP_001049|NP_001091683|NP_001461|NP_001948|NP_005857|NP_005949|NP_006630|NP_032196|NP_032388|NP_036634|NP_036706|NP_036932|NP_037051|NP_057658|NP_058687|NP_058706|NP_058887|NP_058937|NP_071640|NP_110502|NP_112258|NP_112396|NP_113970|NP_671482|NP_899156|NP_937822|P49658|XP_001057307,NIH Initiatives,19279215,0,3.2.2.6,AAD14378|NP_037051|NP_058687|NP_671482|O35458|P02708|P03372|P04150|P04774|P07550|P08172|P08588|P08908|P08913|P11229|P13504|P14416|P15207|P18508|P20309|P21728|P21917|P22756|P23975|P24530|P25021|P25100|P25101|P25103|P25929|P29274|P30411|P30542|P31645|P32297|P35367|P35372|P35408|P35436|P35439|P35462|P41143|P41145|P43140|P46663|P48039|P49146|P49651|P49658|P63059|Q00960|Q01959|Q12809|Q96P65|Q99720|Q9R0C9|Q9UBS5|Q9Y271|XP_001057307,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.
