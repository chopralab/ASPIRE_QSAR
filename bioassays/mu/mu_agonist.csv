To find potent and selective FFA4 agonist, 28 compounds of 3-(4-(phenoxymethyl)phenyl)propanoic acid and N-phenylbenzenesulfonamide derivatives were designed and synthesized, featuring OC and SO2-N linkage. For the OC linkage compounds, 1g showed the most potent FFA4 agonistic activity with a pEC of 5.81 ± 0.04 and exhibited at least 64-fold selectivity against FFA1. For SO2-N linkage agonists, 2m had a pEC of 5.66 ± 0.04 and displayed>46-fold selectivity against FFA1. Among these two series of compounds, 1g was the most potent agonist at FFA4 and the best selectivity against FFA1, demonstrated by docking simulation. Moreover, 1g showed receptor selectivity on other seven GPCRs. In anti-diabetic evaluation, 1g dose-dependently reduced blood glucose, which was better than a clinical phase III drug TAK875.

The compounds were tested in signal transduction assays (ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, Ca mobilization, and β-arrestin recruitment) which identified ERK1/2 phosphorylation-preferring aryloxyethyl derivatives. The novel series showed high 5-HT receptor affinity, >1000-fold selectivity versus noradrenergic α, dopamine D, serotonin 5-HT, histamine H, and muscarinic M receptors, and favorable druglike properties (CNS-MPO, Fsp, LELP). The lead structure, (3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)(4-fluoro-4-(((2-(pyridin-2-yloxy)ethyl)amino)methyl)piperidin-1-yl)methanone (17, NLX-204), displayed high selectivity in the SafetyScreen44 panel (including hERG channel), high solubility, metabolic stability, and Caco-2 penetration and did not block CYP3A4, CYP2D6 isoenzymes, or P-glycoprotein. Preliminary in vivo studies confirmed its promising pharmacokinetic profile. 17 also robustly stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rat cortex and showed highly potent (MED = 0.16 mg/kg) and efficacious antidepressant-like activity, totally eliminating immobility in the rat Porsolt test.

MGS0008 is a highly hydrophilic glutamate analog and is therefore expected to show low oral bioavailability in humans. To improve the oral bioavailability of MGS0008, ester prodrugs of MGS0008 were synthesized and their usefulness was evaluated. Among the prodrugs, the l-menthol-ester prodrug 4h demonstrated preferable lipophilicity, good chemical stability, and a high conversion rate to MGS0008 in human and monkey liver microsomes. A pharmacokinetic study in monkeys revealed that the oral bioavailability of MGS0008 after oral dosing of compound 4h was approximately 15-fold higher than that after oral dosing of MGS0008. Based on these findings, a diastereomer of compound 4h (compound 4j, or MGS0274), was selected as a candidate for clinical drug development, and its besylate is currently under development for the treatment of schizophrenia (Development code: TS-134).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4708814,20220318,9815616|72550767,103348150|461556274,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32698110,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, several neurological complications are now being seen in these patients due to HIV-1 associated injury of neurons by infected microglia and astrocytes. In addition, these effects can be further exacerbated with opiate use and abuse. One possible mechanism for such potentiation effects of opiates is the interaction of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the chemokine receptor CCR5 (CCR5), a known HIV-1 co-receptor, to form MOR-CCR5 heterodimer. In an attempt to understand this putative interaction and its relevance to neuroAIDS, we designed and synthesized a series of bivalent ligands targeting the putative CCR5-MOR heterodimer. To understand how these bivalent ligands may interact with the heterodimer, biological studies including calcium mobilization inhibition, binding affinity, HIV-1 invasion, and cell fusion assays were applied. In particular, HIV-1 infection assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and astrocytes revealed a notable synergy in activity for one particular bivalent ligand. Further, a molecular model of the putative CCR5-MOR heterodimer was constructed, docked with the bivalent ligand, and molecular dynamics simulations of the complex was performed in a membrane-water system to help understand the biological observation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4719349,20220318,5360515|71460188|90666576|162645606|162650661|162660215|162660784|162674876,131283791|163333807|242614426|461518223|461525405|461538971|461539772|461559880,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27720326,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

Numerous SAR studies have revealed that the Arg residue is essential for KOR activity. In contrast, our systematic SAR studies on [des-Arg]Dyn A analogues found that Arg is not a key residue and even deletion of the residue does not affect biological activities at the KOR. In addition, it was also found that [des-Arg]Dyn A(1-9)-NH is a minimum pharmacophore and its modification at the N-terminus leads to selective KOR antagonists. A lead ligand, 14, with high affinity and antagonist activity showed improved metabolic stability and could block antinociceptive effects of a KOR selective agonist, FE200665, in vivo, indicating high potential to treat KOR mediated disorders such as stress-induced relapse.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4719713,20220318,3086114|10677974|25075996|162648718|162648874|162652097|162654400|162654563|162655917|162656427|162659311|162660075|162660594|162662509|162662691|162665925|162666898|162669387|162676268,103241617|103303449|103566017|461522608|461522835|461527498|461530741|461530986|461532921|461533657|461537721|461538763|461539522|461542308|461542593|461547175|461548602|461552123|461561829,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27797517,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

KOR agonists have been proved to be strong analgesics without MOR agonist-related side effects, such as respiratory depression, tolerance, and dependence liability; however, activation of KOR in the central nervous system (CNS) may cause sedation and anxiety. It has been reported that peripheral KOR activation produces comparable bioactivity without CNS-related side effects. Herein, we designed and synthesized a novel tetrapeptide (SHR0687), which was shown to be a highly potent KOR agonist with excellent selectivity over other opioid receptors, such as MOR and DOR. In addition, SHR0687 displayed favorable PK profiles across species, as well as robust in vivo efficacy in a rat carrageenan-induced pain model. Notably, SHR0687 exhibited negligible blood-brain barrier penetration, which was meaningful in minimizing CNS-related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4731389,20220318,5288826|132225744,103169185|461518955,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33214823,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Furthermore, compound 1a seemed more effective than a combination of IT1t and naltrexone in inhibiting HIV entry at the presence of morphine.

Bioisosterism is widely employed in the rational modification of lead compounds, being used to increase potency, enhance selectivity, improve pharmacokinetic properties, eliminate toxicity, and acquire novel chemical space to secure intellectual property. The introduction of a bioisostere leads to structural changes in molecular size, shape, electronic distribution, polarity, pK, dipole or polarizability, which can be either favorable or detrimental to biological activity. This approach has opened up new avenues in drug design and development resulting in more efficient drug candidates introduced onto the market as well as in the clinical pipeline.

In functional assays the 14-phenylacetylamino derivative 6d was a selective delta-agonist whereas the phenethylamino analogue 5d was a mu-agonist and low efficacy delta partial agonist that warrants further investigation as an analgesic with low tolerance and dependence.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749653,20181017,5480230|5497186,103697951|103698780,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12672258,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,1,0,1,1,0,1

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

Isopavines as a new class of morphinomimetics and their human opioid receptor binding activity._||_Abstract: The importance of visual imagery and relational thinking manifests itself in a heuristic approach to the design and synthesis of potential morphinomimetics as agonists of the human mu receptor. The well-known class of alkaloids represented by the isopavine nucleus has a topological resemblance to the morphine skeleton, especially when viewed in a particular way. Enantiopure isopavines can be readily obtained from a 1,2 Stevens rearrangement of 13-substituted dihydromethanodibenzoazocines, prepared in four steps from d- and l-amino acids. Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor.

Andrews analysis of the NIH nonpeptide lead SNC-80 suggested the removal of substituents not predicted to contribute to binding. This approach led to a simplified lead, N, N-diethyl-4-[phenyl(1-piperazinyl)methyl]benzamide (1), which retained potent binding affinity and selectivity to the human delta receptor (IC(50) = 11 nM, mu/delta = 740, kappa/delta > 900) and potency as a full agonist (EC(50) = 36 nM) but had a markedly reduced molecular weight, only one chiral center, and increased in vitro metabolic stability. From this lead, the key pharmacophore groups for delta receptor affinity and activation were more clearly defined by SAR and mutagenesis studies. Further structural modifications on the basis of 1 confirmed the importance of the N, N-diethylbenzamide group and the piperazine lower basic nitrogen for delta binding, in agreement with mutagenesis data. A number of piperazine N-alkyl substituents were tolerated.

It was found that (-)-3 is substantially more potent than its enantiomer (+)-3 as an opioid agonist in vivo and in vitro. In vitro tests (guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle and mouse vas deferens preparations) suggest that (-)-3 mediates its effect chiefly through mu opioid receptors. On the other hand, (+)-3 and the more potent enantiomers of methadone, (-)-1, and isomethadone, (-)-2, appear to have less mu-receptor selectivity and interact with a greater fraction of delta receptors than does (-)-3. The fact that the solid-state conformation of (-)-3 differs from that of (-)-1 and (-)-2, which show great similarity in conformational features, suggests that mu and delta receptors have different conformational requirements.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244. The cis fused, 4,5 dimethyl ether substituted cyclohexane analogue trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzo[b]thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (32) has high in vitro kappa opioid receptor affinity (Ki = 16 nM) and equipotent analgesic activity to morphine after iv administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755059,20200628,13911081|13911085|45260009|45260011|45260017|45260026|45260036|45263803|45264200|45264340|45264344|45264364|45264368|45264405,103221766|103670691|103670693|103670701|103670723|103670738|103670767|103676268|103676905|103677136|103677142|103677166|103677173|103677221,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2567782,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

This drug also possesses potent activity at several other brain receptors (most notably alpha 1 adrenergic receptors). We have prepared the enantiomers and diastereomers of ifenprodil along with a series of partial structures in order to explore the basic structure activity relations within this class of compounds. From this study, it is clear that alpha 1 adrenergic and NMDA receptor activities may be separated by selection of the threo relative stereochemistry. Examination of the optical isomers of threo-ifenprodil (2) reveals that no further improvement in receptor selectivity is gained from either antipode. Individual removal of most of the structural fragments from the ifenprodil molecule generally results in less active compounds although fluorinated derivative 9 with threo relative stereochemistry is somewhat more potent and substantially more selective for the NMDA receptor. Finally a minimum structure for activity in this series (14) has been identified. This stripped-down version of ifenprodil possesses nearly equivalent affinity for the NMDA receptor with no selectivity over alpha 1 adrenergic receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755061,20181013,3689,124960908,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1681106,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However in this series of 14beta-cinnamoylamino derivatives the codeinones (e.g. methoclocinnamox, MC-CAM) had unexpectedly high mu-opioid receptor affinity, similar to that of the morphinone (clocinnamox, C-CAM). The current report relates to the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of deoxyclocinnamox (DOC-CAM) which acted as a high-affinity opioid antagonist similar to C-CAM but with greater mu selectivity. Thus it appears that the C(3)-substituent does not play a major role in the binding of the 14beta-cinnamoyl series and that the cinnamoyl group itself may in fact be the dominant binding feature.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755063,20181016,6540640|44417373,103500772|103500889,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10966754,0,,P35372,9527,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In a previous report we had described the unique biological characteristics of this ligand and also a need for further structural evaluation.(6) To pursue this, we have introduced a completely different heterocyclic template (2 and 3), which, based on molecular modeling studies, may present the required structural features to properly orient the pharmacophore groups. We also have made more subtle changes to the original piperazine scaffold (5 and 11). The biological activities of these compounds revealed an important participation of the scaffold in the ligand-receptor interaction. To further explore functional diversity on the scaffold, we have maintained the original piperazine ring and introduced four different functionalities at position 2 of the heterocyclic ring (15a-d; a = CH(2)-O-CH(2)-Ph; b = Me; c = CH(2)Ph; d = CH(2)OH). The biological activities observed for these compounds showed a very interesting trend in terms of the steric effects of the groups introduced at this position. A decrease of almost 2000-fold in affinity and potency at the delta-receptor was observed for 15c compared with 15b. This difference may be explained if we postulate that the bioactive conformation of these peptidomimetics is close to the minimal energy conformations calculated in our study. On the basis of these findings we have realized the importance of this position to further explore and simplify the structure of future generations of peptidomimetic ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755554,20181016,10503458,103396536,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10639279,0,,P35372,9823,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding. However, a relationship involving the hydrophobic character of the N-substituent is discussed. The N-(2-fluoroethyl) derivatives in both series were found to cause convulsions in rats at doses of 40-45 mg/kg ip.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

Synthesis and evaluation of N-alkyl-substituted (alpha-piperazinylbenzyl)benzamides as novel, highly selective delta opioid receptor agonists._||_Abstract: A series of N-alkyl- and N,N-dialkyl-4-[alpha-[(2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl] benzyl]-benzamides were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor subtypes. Several compounds (2e,f,h,i,m) strongly bound to the delta receptor with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. On the other hand, the binding affinities of these compounds for the mu and kappa receptors were in the micromolar or greater range indicating excellent delta opioid receptor subtype selectivities. In this series, two important structure-activity relationships were found for the delta receptor binding affinity. First, the spatial orientation of the alpha-benzylic position influenced the affinities with the alpha R derivatives 2a-n generally showing more than 10-fold greater affinity than the alpha S derivatives 3a-n. Second, the binding affinities were strongly influenced by the number of alkyl substituents on the amide nitrogen. N-Monoalkylbenzamide derivatives 2b-d showed lower affinity than N,N-dialkylbenzamide derivatives 2e-n, and the N-unsubstituted benzamide derivative 2a had the lowest affinity for the delta receptor in the series. The dramatic effect of the amide group substitution pattern on the binding affinity for the delta receptor strongly suggests that the amide function is an important structural element in the interaction of this series of compounds at the delta receptor. Selective compounds in this series were examined for binding affinity in cloned human mu and delta receptors. The results obtained generally paralleled those from the rat brain binding assay. Compounds 2e,f with potent delta binding affinities and high delta selectivities were shown to be delta agonists with high selectivity by studies in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754567,20181017,5359966|9897164|10078468|10462426|11204993|11239327|11262815|11308721|11364225|11434336,103230838|103393362|103393363|103393415|103393930|103393960|103393961|103394107|103394260|103394266,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,,P35372,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact. It appears that kappa-agonist binding of the orvinols avoids the inhibitory site in the intramolecular H-bonded conformation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751576,20181017,71450939,163316075,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10794701,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751580,20181017,105104|5288826|5497186|10430432|10645976|15548354|15548355|44349947|71456174|73346599|73349647|73352661,103169185|103177815|103357118|103357774|103357911|103697951|163322761|163326190|163326191|174489426|174499610|174509985,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0
150975,Confirmatory,In vitro binding affinity to human Opioid receptor mu 1 on CHO cell membranes using [3H]diprenorphine displacement.,"Title: Structure-activity relationships of dynorphin a analogues modified in the address sequence._||_Abstract: The peptide [Pro3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 2 exhibits high affinity (K(i) = 2.4 nM) and over 2000-fold selectivity for the opioid receptor. Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753407,20181017,60768|5359272|5359966|9804450|9897164|10078468|10462426|11158498|11181676|11204993|11239327|11262815|11307039|11308699|11308721|11364225|11365113|11388486|11411315|11434336|44365804,103230837|103230838|103316363|103393362|103393363|103393415|103393416|103393419|103393420|103393421|103393930|103393960|103393961|103394107|103394260|103394264|103394265|103394266|103394653|103394654|123085530,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

151123,Confirmatory,Binding affinity using [3H]diprenorphine as the radioligand against K303E Opioid receptor mu 1 in COS-7 cells,"Title: Binding of norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) congeners to wild-type and mutant mu and kappa opioid receptors: molecular recognition loci for the pharmacophore and address components of kappa antagonists._||_Abstract: Molecular modifications of both the kappa opioid antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI, 1) and the kappa receptor have provided evidence that the selectivity of this ligand is conferred through ionic interaction if its N17' protonated amine group (an 'address') with a nonconserved acidic residue (Glu297) on the kappa receptor. In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873929,20181017,443408|5480230|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734675|103735456,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P35372,9527,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation.

New potent and selective GABAB agonists._||_Abstract: The antispastic agent and muscle relaxant baclofen 1 is a potent and selective agonist for bicuculline-insensitive GABAB receptors. For many years efforts to obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by replacing the carboxylic acid group of GABA or baclofen derivatives with either the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity relationships of the novel GABAB agonists are discussed with respect to their affinities to GABAB receptors as well as to their effects in many functional tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756441,20181014,6335948,103334995,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650684,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
152091,Literature-derived,Inhibition of [3H]naloxone binding to mu-opiate receptor of central nervous system,"Title: Phosphinic acid analogues of GABA. 2. Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys. The novel GABAB antagonists showed also protective effects in various animal models of absence epilepsy.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL884858,20181014,130021,103335975,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650685,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Analysis of the metabolites of 1 revealed that 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine is formed as the major metabolite and is an agonist at the mu-opioid receptor. To circumvent any potential liability resulting from the metabolite, we decided to identify alternate templates devoid of agonist activity at the mu-opioid receptor to replace the 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety. The present study describes the synthesis and SAR of dihydropyrimidinones linked to substituted 4-phenylpiperazine containing side chains. Compound (+)-38 was identified as a lead compound with a binding and functional profile comparable to that of 1. The putative metabolite 2-carboxamidophenylpiperazine has negligible affinity for the mu-opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756444,20181016,9985476|10099811,103385729|103386174,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10579842,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Approaches to eliminate opioid agonist metabolites via modification of linker and 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety._||_Abstract: We have previously described compound 1a as a high-affinity subtype selective alpha(1a) antagonist. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of compound 1a showed its major metabolite to be a mu-opioid agonist, 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine (3). Several dihydropyrimidinone analogues were synthesized with the goal of either minimizing the formation of 3 by modification of the linker or finding alternative piperidine moieties which when cleaved as a consequence of metabolism would not give rise to mu-opioid activity. Modification of the linker gave several compounds with good alpha(1a) binding affinity (K(i) = < 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d)). In vitro analysis in the microsomal assay revealed these modifications did not significantly affect N-dealkylation and the formation of the piperidine 3. The second approach, however, yielded several piperidine replacements for 3, which did not show significant mu-opioid activity. Several of these compounds maintained good affinity at the alpha(1a) adrenoceptor and selectivity over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d). For example, the piperidine fragments of (+)-73 and (+)-83, viz. 4-cyano-4-phenylpiperidine and 4-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine, were essentially inactive at the mu-opioid receptor (IC(50) > 30 microM vs 3 microM for 3). Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 were subjected to detailed in vitro and in vivo characterization. Both these compounds, in addition to their excellent selectivity (>880-fold) over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d), also showed good selectivity over several other recombinant human G-protein coupled receptors. Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 showed good functional potency in isolated human prostate tissues, with K(b)s comparable to their in vitro alpha(1a) binding data. In addition, compound (+)-73 also exhibited good uroselectivity (DBP K(b)/IUP K(b) > 20-fold) in the in vivo experiments in dogs, similar to 1a.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758204,20181016,10099811,103385729,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10579841,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244.

Docking studies with 3-D models of the hNK-3 and hNK-2 receptors were used to drive the chemical design and speed up the identification of potent and combined antagonsits at both receptors. (S)-(+)-N-(1-Cyclohexylethyl)-3-[(4-morpholin-4-yl)piperidin-1-yl]methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide (compound 25, SB-400238: hNK-3R binding affinity, K(i) = 0.8 nM; hNK-2R binding affinity, K(i) = 0.8 nM) emerged as the best example in this approach. Further studies led to the identification of (S)-(+)-N-(1,2,2-trimethylpropyl)-3-[(4-piperidin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide (compound 28, SB-414240: hNK-3R binding affinity, K(i) = 193 nM; hNK-2R binding affinity, K(i) = 1.0 nM) as the first hNK-2R-selective antagonist belonging to the 2-phenylquinoline chemical class. Since some members of this chemical series showed a significant binding affinity for the human mu-opioid receptor (hMOR), docking studies were also conducted on a 3-D model of the hMOR, resulting in the identification of a viable chemical strategy to avoid any significant micro-opioid component.

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors. Analogues (3 and 6-8) which were shown to have relatively weak delta-opioid receptor antagonist potency have their aromatic groups located in a space that is different from that of the more potent analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL843459,20181014,5310988|5491688|5497186|6438353|46877673|46877674|46877676|46877677,103316748|103556473|103697951|103734768|103734769|103734771|103734772|103734773,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8126697,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS. Such ligands may be useful pharmacologic tools for investigation of peripheral opioid mechanisms.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844969,20181013,46877632,103734688,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Based on the hypothesis that the spatial orientation of the aromatic ring at position 4 of Dyn A is important for opioid receptor affinity and selectivity, a series of Dyn A analogues with various Phe derivatives substituted at position 4 were synthesized and evaluated for their opioid receptor affinity and activity. The L- and D-Homophe4 (homophenylalanine) analogues of [D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 were compared to the (R)- and (S)-Atc4 (2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid) derivatives (Aldrich et al. Chirality 2001, 13, 125-129). [l-Homophe4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the D-Homophe4 isomer, while [(R)-Atc4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the (S)-Atc4 isomer. Comparing the structure of Atc to those of Phe and Homophe, these results suggest that the Atc isomers are functioning more as constrained Homophe rather than Phe analogues in these Dyn A derivatives. The higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity of the (R)-Atc4 analogue suggests that Phe4 of Dyn A most likely adopts a gauche (-) or trans conformation in the kappa-opioid receptor binding site. Comparison of [D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 derivatives containing Aic4 (2-aminoindan-2-carboxylic acid) and Tic4 (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) with the peptides containing their acyclic counterparts alpha-MePhe4 and N-MePhe4, respectively, suggest that the loss in opioid receptor affinity seen for the Aic4 and Tic4 analogues is probably due to an improper orientation of the aromatic ring in these residues. Most of the analogues in this series showed much lower affinity for delta-opioid receptors than the parent peptide, suggesting that kappa- and delta-opioid receptors have distinct binding pockets for the residue at position 4 of Dyn A.

The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260).

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852600,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These results indicate that a positively charged N-terminal amino group may be essential for signal transduction but not for receptor binding and suggested that its deletion in agonist opioid peptides containing an N-terminal 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) residue may represent a general way to convert them into antagonists. In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group. This was achieved by replacement of Tyr(1) with 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp]. Compounds were tested in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens bioassays and in rat and guinea pig brain membrane receptor binding assays. All analogues turned out to be potent kappa antagonists against Dyn A(1-13) and the non-peptide agonist U50,488 and showed only weak mu and delta antagonist activity. The most potent and most selective kappa antagonist of the series was [(2S)-Mdp(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (5, dynantin), which showed subnanomolar kappa antagonist potency against Dyn A(1-13) and very high kappa selectivity both in terms of its K(e) values determined against kappa, mu, and delta agonists and in terms of its ratios of kappa, mu, and delta receptor binding affinity constants.

The methyloctahydroisoquinolines 6a-g can exist in conformations where the 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent is either axial or equatorial, similar to the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines 4. The 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is responsible for the antagonist activity observed in the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine antagonists. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 6a shows that the 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is favored in the solid state. Molecular modeling studies also suggest that the equatorial conformation has lower potential energy relative to that of the axial conformation.

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process. We believe that this is one of the first examples for a Phase III drug candidate that was discovered and optimized, from start to finish, using in silico model-based methods as the primary tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL862261,20181020,9851104|11430856,103488450|103570372,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16722631,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

On these bases we synthesised and evaluated pharmacologically in the mouse vas deferens assay a series of N/OFQ-NH(2) analogues substituted in position 7 and 11 with Calpha,alpha-disubstituted cyclic, linear and branched amino acids. None of the 20 novel N/OFQ analogues produced better results than [Aib(7)]N/OFQ-NH(2). Thus, this substitution was combined with other chemical modifications known to modulate peptide potency and/or efficacy generating compound 21 [Nphe(1)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (coded as UFP-111), compound 22 [(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-112) and compound 23 [Phe(1)Psi(CH(2)-NH)Gly(2)(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-113).

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of a potent mu-agonist delta-antagonist and an exceedingly potent antinociceptive in the enantiomeric C9-substituted 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-phenylethylmorphan series._||_Abstract: Both of the enantiomers of 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-phenylethylmorphan with C9alpha-methyl, C9-methylene, C9-keto, and C9alpha- and C9beta-hydroxy substituents were synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated. Three of the 10 compounds, (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-9-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl-2-phenylethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10), (1R,5S)-(+)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methylene-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S)-(+)-14), and (1R,5S,9R)-(-)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methyl-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S,9R)-(+)-15) had subnanomolar affinity at mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.19, 0.19, and 0.63 nM, respectively). The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point. Based on modeling, the spatial arrangement of the protonated nitrogen atom and the 9beta-OH substituent in (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 may facilitate the alignment of a putative water chain enabling proton transfer to a nearby proton acceptor group in the mu-opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL895006,20181022,5288826|5462471|16756840|16757050|44427434,103169185|103217856|103525470|103525473|103525475,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17625813,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

A novel series of 1,2,4-triazol-3-yl-thiopropyl-tetrahydrobenzazepines demonstrating a high level of D3 affinity and selectivity with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile is reported here. In particular, the pyrazolyl derivative 35 showed good oral bioavailability and brain penetration associated with high potency and selectivity in vitro. In vivo characterization of 35 confirmed that this compound blocks the expression of nicotine- and cocaine-conditioned place preference in the rat, prevents nicotine-triggered reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior in the rat, reduces oral operant alcohol self-administration in the mouse, increases extracellular levels of acetylcholine in the rat medial prefrontal cortex, and potentiates the amplitude of the relative cerebral blood volume response to d-amphetamine in a regionally specific manner in the rat brain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL895560,20181022,11584660,103528240,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17867665,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970717,20181026,5497186|15307413|24949529|24949532|24949683|24949684|24949687|24949689,103586336|103587313|103622354|103622355|103622440|103623454|103623455|103697951,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

However, most opioids currently available have a variety of side-effects as well as exhibiting tolerance. Tolerance is most likely to be a complex phenomenon, however, the role of receptor internalisation is thought to play a crucial role. In this study, we examined the role of aromaticity in ligand-mediated receptor internalisation of the mu-opioid receptor (MOPR). These studies show that the amount of receptor internalisation may be dependant on the amphiphilicity of the ligand. Specifically, deletion of the C-terminus aromatic residues of endomorphin 1, particularly tryptophan reduces receptor-mediated internalisation whilst the addition of tryptophan within the enkephalin sequence increases receptor internalisation and decreases tolerance.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970213,20181024,9985128|44577308|44577349,103208667|103621930|103622000,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18329886,0,,P35372,9606,19.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

We conducted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies on COS cells coexpressing MOP and CCK2 receptors to determine whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in such modulation. These studies revealed the absence of constitutive or monovalent ligand-induced heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of MOP and CCK2 receptors therefore is unlikely to be responsible for the opposing effects between morphine and CCK in the CNS. However, association was induced, as indicated by a positive BRET signal, on exposure of the cells to bivalent ligands containing mu-opioid agonist and CCK2 receptor antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers containing 16-22 atoms but not with a shorter (9-atom) spacer. These studies demonstrate for the first time that an appropriately designed bivalent ligand is capable of inducing association of G-protein-coupled receptors.

The discoveries of BW373U86 (1) and SNC80 (2) contributed to the rapid expansion of research in this field. However, poor drug-like properties and low therapeutic indices have prevented clinical evaluation of these agents. Doses of 1 and 2 similar to those required for analgesic activity produce convulsions in rodents and nonhuman primates. Recently, we described a novel series of potent, selective, and orally bioavailable delta opioid receptor agonists. The lead derivative, ADL5859 (4), is currently in phase II proof-of-concept studies for the management of pain. Further structure activity relationship exploration has led to the discovery of ADL5747 (36), which is approximately 50-fold more potent than 4 in an animal model of inflammatory pain.

These compounds are highly potent mu and kappa ligands, e.g., p-methoxyphenylaminocyclorphan showing a K(i) of 0.026 nM at the mu receptor and a K(i) of 0.03 nM at the kappa receptor. Phenyl carbamates and phenylureas were synthesized and investigated. Selective o-formylation of butorphan and levorphanol was achieved. This reaction opened the way to a large set of 2-substituted 3-hydroxymorphinans, including 2-hydroxymethyl-, 2-aminomethyl-, and N-substituted 2-aminomethyl-3-hydroxymorphinans. Bivalent ligands bridged in the 2-position were also synthesized and connected with secondary and tertiary aminomethyl groups, amide bonds, and hydroxymethylene groups, respectively.

476639,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu opioid receptor,"Title: 'Carba'-analogues of fentanyl are opioid receptor agonists._||_Abstract: There is evidence to indicate that the Asp residue in the third transmembrane helix (TMH) of opioid receptors forms a salt bridge with the positively charged nitrogen of endogenous and exogenous opioid ligands. To further examine the role of this electrostatic interaction in receptor binding and activation, we synthesized 'carba'-analogues of a published fentanyl analogue containing a 3-(guanidinomethyl)-benzyl group in place of the phenyl moiety attached to the ethylamido group (C. Dardonville et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 6570-6580 (1)), in which the piperidine ring nitrogen was replaced with a carbon. As expected, the resulting cis and trans isomers (8a and 8b) showed reduced mu and kappa opioid receptor binding affinities as compared to 1 but, surprisingly, retained opioid full agonist activity with about half the potency of leucine-enkephalin in the guinea pig ileum assay.

Stereoselective reduction, reductive amination, and Mitsunobu inversions were the key steps for the establishment of the desired stereochemistry. The kappa affinity decreased in the following order depending on the N-substituent: CO(2)CH(3) > benzyl > COCH(2)CH(3). Bicyclic derivatives with (1S,2R,5R)-configuration showed the highest kappa receptor affinity, which led to dihedral angles of 97 degrees and 45 degrees for the N(pyrrolidine)-C-C-N(phenylacetamide) structural element.

These modifications were made mainly on the aryl side of the ester bond to permit possible rapid labeling of the carboxylic acid component with a positron emitter, either carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min), and included (i) replacement of the iodine atom with a small substituent such as nitrile, methyl, or fluoro, (ii) methylation of the 8-amino group, (iii) opening of the dioxan ring, and (iv) alteration of the length of the N-alkyl goup. High-affinity ligands were discovered for recombinant human 5-HT(4) receptors with amenability to labeling with a positron emitter and potential for development as imaging probes. The ring-opened radioligand, (([methoxy-(11)C]1-butylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 4-amino-3-methoxybenzoate; [(11)C]13), showed an especially favorable array of properties for future evaluation as a PET radioligand for brain 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1259918,20180915,49783209|49783415|49783419,123087255|123089475|123092024,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20812727,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Using pharmacophore analysis, we designed and synthesized compounds which bind to both serotonin receptor subtype 1A (5-HT(1A)) and subtype 3 (5-HT(3)). Quinazolinone derivatives with a sulfur atom in the linker showed high affinity in in vitro assays, but low in vivo activity. Focusing on the linker to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, the sulfur atom in the linker was replaced with a methylene group. Further optimization led to the discovery of compound 17m (TZB-30878) ( J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007 , 322 , 1315 - 1323 , Patent WO2005082887 (A1), 2005 ), a novel 5-HT(1A) agonist/5-HT(3) antagonist in the 3-aminoquinazolinone series. In in vivo functional assays, 17m dose dependently inhibited the Bezold-Jarisch reflex and induced 5-HT(1A)-mediated behaviors, and in an IBS animal model, 17m significantly inhibited stress-induced defecation. Pretreatment by WAY-100635 (5-HT(1A) antagonist) significantly attenuated but did not abolish the inhibitory effects of 17m. These results suggested that 17m exerted inhibitory effects via both 5-HT(1A) agonistic and 5-HT(3) antagonistic activities and that 17m would be useful as a therapeutic agent for IBS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1286337,20180915,11430418,123084393,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20931963,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The secondary amine 10 represents the central building block for the synthesis of more than 25 tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-1-ols. Generally 7-hydroxy derivatives display higher NR2B receptor affinities than the corresponding 7-benzyloxy compounds. A distance of four atoms (five bond lengths) between the basic amino group and the terminal aryl moiety led to highest NR2B affinity. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (WMS-1410, 25) represents the most promising NR2B antagonist of this series showing a K(i)-value of 14nM. Compound 25 reveals excellent selectivity over more than 100 further relevant target proteins, antagonizes glutamate induced excitotoxicity (IC(50)=18.4nM) and is metabolically more stable than ifenprodil.

Endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor [or opioid-receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor] are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the immune systems, and peripheral organs, and have a crucial role in the pain sensory system. Indeed, peripheral or intrathecal N/OFQ has displayed antinociceptive activities in neuropathic pain models, and inhibitory effects on pain-related neurotransmitter releases and on synaptic transmissions of C- and Aδ-fibers. In this study, design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of peripheral/spinal cord-targeting non-peptide NOP receptor agonist were investigated for the treatment of neuropathic pain, which resulted in the discovery of highly selective and potent novel NOP receptor full agonist {1-[4-(2-{hexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl}-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]cyclooctyl}methanol 1 (HPCOM) as systemically (subcutaneously) potent new-class analgesic. Thus, 1 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibitory effect against mechanical allodynia in chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain model rats, robust metabolic stability and little hERG potassium ion channel binding affinity, with its unique and potentially safe profiles and mechanisms, which were distinctive from those of N/OFQ in terms of site-differential effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1659149,20200626,49843555|53316968|53316969|53319615|53319617|53322245|53324890|53325608,124956810|124956811|124962100|124962102|124967393|124972650|124972651|124973921,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20875743,0,,P35372,9606,198.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Binding studies revealed that all new 14-phenylpropoxymorphinans (11-18) displayed high affinity to opioid receptors. Replacement of the 14-methoxy group with a phenylpropoxy group led to an enhancement in affinity to all three opioid receptor types, with most pronounced increases in δ and κ activities, hence resulting in a loss of μ receptor selectivity. All compounds (11-18) showed potent and long-lasting antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick test in rats after subcutaneous administration. For the N-methyl derivatives 13 and 14, analgesic potencies were in the range of their 14-methoxy analogues 9 and 10, respectively. Even derivatives 15-18 with an N-cyclopropylmethyl substituent acted as potent antinociceptive agents, being several fold more potent than morphine.

N/OFQ and NOP receptor are located in the corticolimbic regions that are involved in the integration of the emotional activity, and located in the spinal cord, the peripheral nervous systems or other peripheral tissues that are related to pain as well as urinary signal transmissions, with a pattern distinct from that of classical opioid peptides and their receptors in rodents or primates. Furthermore, N/OFQ-NOP receptor system plays an important role in the regulation of various human physiologies such as depression effect, hyperphasia effect, and blood pressure effect. In this study, the structure-activity relationship of novel NOP receptor antagonist for various 1-(β-amino substituted-β-alanyl)-N,N-dimethylindoline-2-carboxamides was investigated in vitro to elucidate structural requisites to identify and develop potent and selective NOP receptor antagonists, which resulted in the discovery of 1-{3-[4-(substituted phenyl)piperidin-1-yl]propanoyl}-N,N-dimethylindoline-2-carboxamide analogues that display potent and selective human NOP (hNOP) receptor binding affinity and potent hNOP receptor antagonist activity.

Herein, we describe the discovery and development of an antagonist NOP receptor occupancy (RO) tracer and a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand suitable to probe the NOP receptor in human clinical studies. A thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) around the high-affinity 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold identified a series of subnanomolar, highly selective NOP antagonists. Subsequently, these unlabeled NOP ligands were evaluated in vivo by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in rat to determine brain uptake, kinetics and specific binding. (S)-27 was identified as a suitable unlabeled preclinical RO tracer to accurately quantify NOP receptor engagement in rat brain. Three compounds were selected for evaluation in nonhuman primates as PET tracers: (-)-26, (-)-30, and (-)-33. Carbon-11 labeling of (+)-31 yielded [(11)C]-(S)-30, which exhibited minimal generation of central nervous system (CNS) penetrant radiometabolites, improved brain uptake, and was an excellent PET radioligand in both rat and monkey.

However, their central administration led to the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Conjugation of C-terminal substance P (SP) fragments to opioids and opioid peptides was previously shown to produce hybrid peptides with strong analgesic activity, with low or no propensity to develop tolerance. In this study, four peptides (2-5) comprised of endomorphin-1 (1) and C-terminal fragments of SP (four or five amino acids, SP(8-11) (2) or SP(7-11) (4), respectively), with an overlapping Phe residue, were synthesized. To overcome low metabolic stability and poor membrane permeability of the peptide, the N-terminus of 2 and 4 was further modified with a C10-carbon lipoamino acid (C10LAA) achieving 3 and 5, respectively. LAA-modification of the hybrid peptides resulted in a significant increase in metabolic stability and membrane permeability compared to peptides 1, 2 and 4. Compound 5 showed potent μ-opioid receptor binding affinity (K(iμ)=3.87 ± 0.51 nM) with dose-dependent agonist activity in the nanomolar range (IC(50)=45 ± 13 nM). In silico modeling was used to investigate the binding modes and affinities of compounds 1-5 in the active site of μ-opioid receptors.

The value of the adamantyl group in drug design is multidimensional. The hydrophobic substituent constant for the adamantyl group has been estimated from the calculated partition coefficients (clogP values) of 31 adamantyl-bearing compounds in the clinic or in development as πadamantyl=3.1, which indicates that the logP value of a compound with high water solubility (logP<<0) could be moved with an adamantyl-based modification to a region that is more clinically useful. The steric bulk of the adamantyl group can: (i) restrict or modulate intramolecular reactivity; and (ii) impede the access of hydrolytic enzymes, thereby increasing drug stability and plasma half life. The value of the adamantyl group in drug design has been recognized most recently in the design of agents to treat iron overload disease (in development), malaria (in clinical trials) and type 2 diabetes (in the clinic).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2174528,20200625,10529438,103390432,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21354674,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

A high throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, led to the discovery of a non-peptidic β-arrestin biased agonist for NTR1. The lead compound, 2-cyclopropyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- piperazin-1-yl)quinazoline, 32 (ML314), exhibits full agonist behavior against NTR1 (EC50 = 2.0 μM) in the primary assay and selectivity against NTR2. The effect of 32 is blocked by the NTR1 antagonist SR142948A in a dose dependent manner. Unlike peptide based NTR1 agonists, compound 32 has no significant response in a Ca(2+) mobilization assay and is thus a biased agonist that activates the β-arrestin pathway rather than the traditional G q coupled pathway. This bias has distinct biochemical and functional consequences that may lead to physiological advantages. Compound 32 displays good brain penetration in rodents, and studies examining its in vivo properties are underway.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2433825,20200629,53245590,174498737,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24611085,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor. Thus, the analog with a 17-(3-ethoxypropyl) group showed the best selectively and potent agonistic activity for the δ receptor among KNT-127 derivatives.

A bivalent ligand 1 with a 21-atom spacer was thus synthesized and explicitly characterized as a novel pharmacological probe to study the underlying mechanism of opioid-enhanced NeuroAIDS. The steric hindrance generated from the spacer affected the binding affinity and Ca(2+) flux inhibition function activity of bivalent ligand 1 at the chemokine receptor CCR5 more profoundly than it did at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, the CCR5 radioligand binding affinity and the Ca(2+) flux inhibition function of the ligand seemed not necessarily to correlate with its antiviral activity given that it was at least two times more potent than maraviroc alone in reducing Tat expression upon HIV-1 infection in human astrocytes. Furthermore, the ligand was also about two times more potent than the simple mixture of maraviroc and naltrexone in the same viral entry inhibition assay. Therefore bivalent ligand 1 seemed to function more effectively by targeting specifically the putative MOR-CCR5 heterodimer in the viral invasion process. The results reported here suggest that a properly designed bivalent ligand may serve as a useful chemical probe to study the potential MOR-CCR5 interaction during the progression of NeuroAIDS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3227490,20181002,5360515|89702731|90666576,131283791|242614425|242614426,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23682308,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

The SAR reported here is focused on the influence of various piperidine nitrogen aromatic substituents on the ratio of binding affinity and intrinsic activity at both the NOP and MOP receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3270918,20181003,22558157|86279209|90655970|90655971|90655972|90655973|90655974|90655975|90655976|90655977|90655978|90655979,242635767|242635768|242635769|242635770|242635771|242635772|242635773|242635774|242635775|242635776|242635777|242635778,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24657054,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285644,20200618,5748589|90678812|90678813,242640973|242640974|242640975,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Two series of glycopeptides were assessed for opioid receptor binding affinity. Attempts to alter the mu-selectivity of [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO)-related glycopeptides by altering the charged residues of the amphipathic helical address were unsuccessful. A series of pan-agonists was evaluated for antinociceptive activity (55 °C tail flick) in mice. A flexible linker was required to maintain antinociceptive activity. Circular dichroism (CD) in H2O, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and SDS micelles confirmed the importance of the amphipathic helices (11s → 11sG → 11) for antinociception. The glycosylated analogues showed only nascent helices and random coil conformations in H2O. Chemical shift indices (CSI) and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) with 600 MHz NMR and CD confirmed helical structures in micelles, which were rationalized by molecular dynamics calculations.

1261647,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu opioid receptor (unknown origin),"Title: Discovery of Novel Multifunctional Ligands with μ/δ Opioid Agonist/Neurokinin-1 (NK1) Antagonist Activities for the Treatment of Pain._||_Abstract: Multifunctional ligands with agonist bioactivities at μ/δ opioid receptors (MOR/DOR) and antagonist bioactivity at the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) have been designed and synthesized. These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the probe incorporating a sulfonated cyanine-5 fluorophore was the most appropriate for imaging studies. This ligand was subsequently employed in an automated fluorescence-based competition binding assay, allowing the pKi values of several well-known opioid ligands to be determined. Thus, this new probe will prove useful in future studies of MOR receptor pharmacology.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3748909,20200623,127038943,336888136,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26632862,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine.

Recently, many groups have sought MOR agonists that induce minimal βarrestin-mediated signaling because MOR agonist-treated βarrestin2 knockout mice were found to display enhanced antinociceptive effects with significantly less respiratory depression and tachyphylaxis. Substantial data now exists to support the premise that G protein signaling biased MOR agonists can be effective analgesic agents.

According to the pharmacological results, the functional reversal observed in orvinol analogues by introduction of 7β-methyl substituent could not be reproduced in nepenthone analogues. Alternatively, introduction of 7β-methyl substituent was associated with substantial loss of both subtype selectivity and potency but not efficacy for nepenthone analogues, which was not found in 7β-methyl orvinol analogues. Surprisingly, SLL-603, a 7β-methyl analogue of SLL-020ACP, was identified to be a KOR full agonist. The possible molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity in activity cliff was also investigated. In conclusion, 7β-methyl substituent was a structural locus associated with activity cliff and demonstrated as a pharmacological heterogeneity between nepenthone and orvinol analogues that warrants further investigations.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4234963,20200619,118200491|118200640|134227139|145982510|145982515|145982585|145982792|145982828|145982968|145983526|145983969|145984022|145984192|145984332|145984702|145984984|145986165,404700896|404700902|404701000|404701302|404701354|404701555|404702330|404702946|404703021|404703256|404703400|404703467|404703987|404704355|404704805|404704854|404706051,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30054192,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Ghrelin further acts on inflammation, appetite, and adipogenesis and for this reason was considered an important target to address catabolic conditions.

Thus, hLH-R represents a valid target for the treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers and diseases (polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, endometriosis) as well as contraception. Screening of the Bayer compound library led to the discovery of tetrahydrothienopyridine derivatives as novel, small-molecule (SMOL) hLH-R inhibitors and to the development of BAY-298, the first nanomolar hLH-R antagonist reducing sex hormone levels in vivo. Further optimization of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters led to the identification of BAY-899 with an improved in vitro profile and proven efficacy in vivo. BAY-298 and BAY-899 serve as valuable tool compounds to study hLH-R signaling in vitro and to interfere with the production of sex hormones in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4323864,20210302,139600336|139600337,440134679|440177903,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31670515,0,,P35372,9606,198.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Since neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor antagonists reversed opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, the present work was performed to synthetize two branched peptidomimetics, EKR and RKE, containing the opioid peptide endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9. Our data obtained from the in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate experiment demonstrated that EKR functioned as a mixed mu-, delta-opioid receptors agonist and NPFF<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist/NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist, whereas RKE acted as a multi-functional peptidomimetic with the mu-opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism. Furthermore, EKR and RKE completely blocked the NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth of Neuro 2A cells. In vivo antinociception studies found that supraspinal administration of EKR and RKE dose-dependently produced potent antinociception via the mu-opioid receptor in the tail-flick test. In carrageenan inflammatory pain model, spinal administration of EKR and RKE induced dose-related analgesia, which was significantly reduced by the opioid antagonist naloxone and the NPFF antagonist RF9. Notably, compared with morphine, intracerebroventricular repeated administration of EKR and RKE maintained prolonged antinociceptive effectiveness. In addition, at the antinociceptive doses, these two branched peptidomimetics did not significantly inhibit gastrointestinal transit. Taken together, the present work suggest that EKR and RKE behave as multi-functional ligands with the opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism, and produce prolonged antinociception with limited side effects. Moreover, our results imply that EKR and RKE might be interesting pharmacological tools for further investigating the biological function of the NPFF and opioid systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4333170,20210302,5311081|155515973|155520785,103347472|440118014|440125450,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30626554,0,,P35372,9606,,,,1,0,1,1,1,0

In vivo effect of 2S-LP2 (5) was consistent with the improved MOR/DOR efficacy profile assessed by radioligand binding assay, to evaluate the opioid receptor affinity, and BRET assay, to evaluate the capability to promote receptor/G-protein and receptor/β-arrestin 2 interaction. 2S-LP2 (5) was able to activate, with different efficacy, G-protein pathway over β-arrestin 2, behaving as biased agonist at MOR and mainly at DOR. Considering the therapeutic potential of both multitarget MOR/DOR agonism and functional selectivity over G-protein, the 2S-LP2 (5) biased multitarget MOR/DOR agonist could provide a safer treatment opportunity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4341033,20210302,132609311|155554074,381885009|440190946,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30822708,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

A set of spirocyclic cyclohexanes with diverse O-heterocycles and amino moieties (general structure III) was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated. In structure-activity relationships studies, the σ1 receptor affinity and σ1:σ2 selectivity were correlated with the stereochemistry, the kind and substitution pattern of the O-heterocycle, and the substituents at the exocyclic amino moiety. cis-configured 2-benzopyran cis-11b bearing a methoxy group and a tertiary cyclohexylmethylamino moiety showed the highest σ1 affinity ( Ki = 1.9 nM) of this series of compounds. In a Ca2+ influx assay, cis-11b behaved as a σ1 antagonist. cis-11b reveals high selectivity over σ2 and opioid receptors. The interactions of the novel σ1 ligands were analyzed on the molecular level using the recently reported X-ray crystal structure of the σ1 receptor protein. The protonated amino moiety forms a persistent salt bridge with E172. The spiro[benzopyran-1,1'-cyclohexane] scaffold and the cyclohexylmethyl moiety occupy two hydrophobic pockets.

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM). Most of the synthesized ligands reveal either similar GluN2B and σ<sub>1</sub> affinity or higher σ<sub>1</sub> affinity than GluN2B affinity. The methyl ether 16b shows high σ<sub>1</sub> affinity (K<sub>i</sub>(σ<sub>1</sub>) = 6.6 nM) and high selectivity over a broad panel of receptors and transporters.

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity. Molecular modeling suggests that ML417 interacts with the D3R in a unique manner, possibly explaining its remarkable selectivity. ML417 was also found to protect against neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs.

Herein, we report the pharmacology and SAR studies both in vitro and in vivo of mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (3), an oxidative rearrangement product of the corynanthe alkaloid mitragynine. 3 and its corresponding corynantheidine analogs show promise as potent analgesics with a mechanism of action that includes mu opioid receptor agonism/delta opioid receptor antagonism. In vitro, 3 and its analogs were potent agonists in [(35)S]GTPγS assays at the mu opioid receptor but failed to recruit β-arrestin-2, which is associated with opioid side effects. Additionally, 3 developed analgesic tolerance more slowly than morphine, showed limited physical dependence, respiratory depression, constipation, and displayed no reward or aversion in CPP/CPA assays, suggesting that analogs might represent a promising new generation of novel pain relievers.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429823,20210302,3034396|5311081|5462471|44301524|44301701|155515067|155520861|155523378|155526934|155545759,103217856|103248311|103248656|103248787|103347472|440116650|440125572|440129482|440134886|440170039,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27556704,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430771,20210302,155532072,440142712,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Increasingly bulky enantiomeric N-alkyl homologs were prepared until their interaction with the sigma 1 receptor decreased and their insolubility became a hindrance to their evaluation in vivo and/or in vitro. The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors. However, bulkier homologs (hexyl through decyl) displayed higher enantioselectivity at kappa or delta receptors than at the mu (monkey) receptor. The (+)-butyl through (+)-octyl homologs were essentially equipotent with, or more potent than, (+)-pentazocine at the sigma receptor.

In functional assays the 14-phenylacetylamino derivative 6d was a selective delta-agonist whereas the phenethylamino analogue 5d was a mu-agonist and low efficacy delta partial agonist that warrants further investigation as an analgesic with low tolerance and dependence.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749735,20181017,5360515|5480230|5497186,103697951|103698780|131283791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12672258,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Thus Michael reaction of the benzylimines of oxycodones and oxymorphones with nitrostyrenes gave a series of 4'-aryl-N-benzylpyrrolomorphinans. These were selective delta antagonists of much higher in vitro potency (with 5a having K(e) delta = <1 nM) than their binding affinities predicted. In mice in vivo assays 5a showed good delta antagonist activity in the anti-writhing analgesic assay and also inhibited delta agonist-induced convulsant activity.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL884514,20181017,44367028,103397107,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11784158,0,,P35372,,197.0,,,0,1,1,1,1,0

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

The 7-substituted compounds (3b) were significantly less potent antinociceptive agents than their 6-substituted counterparts (3a), the octahydroisoquinoline analogues exhibiting intermediate activity. The axial 8-methyl-6-exocyclic methylene isoquinoline (20) is the most potent compound in the mouse abdominal constriction assay (ED50 = 0.05 mg/kg sc), whereas the equatorial 8-methyl isomer (16) was significantly less potent (ED50 = 3.3 mg/kg sc).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754077,20181013,167448|5288826|5462471|44273397|44367821|44367907|44367923|44367999|44368165|44368438|44368439,103169185|103186171|103217856|103399248|103399279|103399463|103399478|103399592|103399855|103400288|103400289,4985|4986|4988,In vitro,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1310115,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244. The cis fused, 4,5 dimethyl ether substituted cyclohexane analogue trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzo[b]thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (32) has high in vitro kappa opioid receptor affinity (Ki = 16 nM) and equipotent analgesic activity to morphine after iv administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755058,20181012,13911081|13911085|45260009|45260011|45260017|45260026|45260036|45263803|45264200|45264340|45264344|45264364|45264368|45264405|70682920|70695535,103221766|103670691|103670693|103670701|103670723|103670738|103670767|103676268|103676905|103677136|103677142|103677166|103677173|103677221|160670773|160703023,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2567782,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755060,20200628,5360515|46877642,103734702|131283791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In a previous report we had described the unique biological characteristics of this ligand and also a need for further structural evaluation.(6) To pursue this, we have introduced a completely different heterocyclic template (2 and 3), which, based on molecular modeling studies, may present the required structural features to properly orient the pharmacophore groups. We also have made more subtle changes to the original piperazine scaffold (5 and 11). The biological activities of these compounds revealed an important participation of the scaffold in the ligand-receptor interaction. To further explore functional diversity on the scaffold, we have maintained the original piperazine ring and introduced four different functionalities at position 2 of the heterocyclic ring (15a-d; a = CH(2)-O-CH(2)-Ph; b = Me; c = CH(2)Ph; d = CH(2)OH). The biological activities observed for these compounds showed a very interesting trend in terms of the steric effects of the groups introduced at this position. A decrease of almost 2000-fold in affinity and potency at the delta-receptor was observed for 15c compared with 15b. This difference may be explained if we postulate that the bioactive conformation of these peptidomimetics is close to the minimal energy conformations calculated in our study. On the basis of these findings we have realized the importance of this position to further explore and simplify the structure of future generations of peptidomimetic ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755555,20181016,10342555|10791647,103396326|103396354,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10639279,0,,P35372,9823,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor. X-ray crystal structures of several compounds corroborate stereochemistries and overall topologies.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753178,20181017,5284371|5288826|5359272|10366960|11139094|11184946|51004758|51009928|71449105|71450900|71458037|122197315|122197316|122197485|122197486|122197487|122197488|122197489|122197490|122197491|122197492|122197493|122197494|122197495|122197496|122197497|122197498|122197499|122197500|122197501|122197502|122197503|122197504|122197505|122197506|122197507|122197508|122197509|122197510|122197511|122197512,103169185|103169342|123085530|163312605|163315964|163315965|163319422|163329699|163329700|318463930|318463938|318463939|318464366|318464367|318464368|318464369|318464370|318464371|318464372|318464373|318464374|318464375|318464376|318464377|318464378|318464379|318464380|318464381|318464382|318464383|318464384|318464385|318464386|318464387|318464388|318464389|318464390|318464391|318464392|318464393|318464394,4988,In vitro,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12502358,0,,P35372,,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754564,20181017,5359966|9897164|10078468|10462426|11204993|11239327|11262815|11308721|11364225|11434336,103230838|103393362|103393363|103393415|103393930|103393960|103393961|103394107|103394260|103394266,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,,P35372,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757366,20181017,443408|5480230|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734675|103735456,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,,P35372,9527,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Peptides extended at the C-terminus with residues which can be used as handles for further modification and/or labeling (i.e. Asx, Glx, and Lys) were synthesized. The TIPP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives exhibited similar delta-receptor affinity to TIPP (K(i) = 5-10 nM vs K(i) = 6 nM), and neither the location of the carboxylic acid moiety nor the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue significantly affected the delta-receptor affinity of these derivatives. Extension of TIPP with an additional residue did not increase mu-receptor affinity, even though the position of the acidic group, which imparts delta-receptor selectivity to TIPP, was shifted relative to the carboxylic acid moiety of TIPP. The delta-receptor affinities of the TIP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives were found to be influenced mainly by the position of the carboxylic acid function rather than the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue. TIP(P)-D/L-Lys(Ac)-OH derivatives exhibited moderate delta-receptor affinity (K(i)(delta) = 16-28 nM).

Approaches to eliminate opioid agonist metabolites via modification of linker and 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety._||_Abstract: We have previously described compound 1a as a high-affinity subtype selective alpha(1a) antagonist. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of compound 1a showed its major metabolite to be a mu-opioid agonist, 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine (3). Several dihydropyrimidinone analogues were synthesized with the goal of either minimizing the formation of 3 by modification of the linker or finding alternative piperidine moieties which when cleaved as a consequence of metabolism would not give rise to mu-opioid activity. Modification of the linker gave several compounds with good alpha(1a) binding affinity (K(i) = < 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d)). In vitro analysis in the microsomal assay revealed these modifications did not significantly affect N-dealkylation and the formation of the piperidine 3. The second approach, however, yielded several piperidine replacements for 3, which did not show significant mu-opioid activity. Several of these compounds maintained good affinity at the alpha(1a) adrenoceptor and selectivity over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d). For example, the piperidine fragments of (+)-73 and (+)-83, viz. 4-cyano-4-phenylpiperidine and 4-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine, were essentially inactive at the mu-opioid receptor (IC(50) > 30 microM vs 3 microM for 3). Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 were subjected to detailed in vitro and in vivo characterization. Both these compounds, in addition to their excellent selectivity (>880-fold) over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d), also showed good selectivity over several other recombinant human G-protein coupled receptors. Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 showed good functional potency in isolated human prostate tissues, with K(b)s comparable to their in vitro alpha(1a) binding data.

152086,Confirmatory,Agonist activity for Opioid receptor mu 1,"Title: Evolution of the Dmt-Tic pharmacophore: N-terminal methylated derivatives with extraordinary delta opioid antagonist activity._||_Abstract: The delta opioid antagonist H-Dmt-Tic-OH (2',6'-dimethyl-L-tyrosyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) exhibits extraordinary delta receptor binding characteristics [Ki delta = 0.022 nM; Ki mu/Ki delta = 150,000] and delta antagonism (pA2 = 8.2; Ke = 5.7 nM). A change in chirality of Dmt at C alpha (1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 13) curtailed delta receptor parameters, while replacement of its alpha-amino function by a methyl group (3) led to inactivity; Tyr-Tic analogues 4 and 11 weakly interacted with delta receptors. N-Alkylation of H-Dmt-Tic-OH and H-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH with methyl groups produced potent delta-opioid ligands with high delta receptor binding capabilities and enhanced delta antagonism: (i) N-Me-Dmt-Tic-OH 5 had high delta opioid binding (Ki delta = 0.2 nM), elevated delta antagonism on mouse vas deferens (MVD) (pA2 = 8.5; Ke = 2.8 nM), and nondetectable mu activity with guinea pig ileum (GPI). (ii) N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) was equally efficacious in delta receptor binding (Ki delta = 0.12 nM; Ki mu/Ki delta = 20000), but delta antagonism rose considerably (pA2 = 9.4; Ke = 0.28 nM) with weak mu antagonism (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:5640). N-Me-(9) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) also augmented delta opioid receptor binding, such that 15 demonstrated high affinity (Ki delta = 0.0755 nM) and selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 20132) with exceptional antagonist activity on MVD (pA2 = 9.6; Ke = 0.22 nM) and weak antagonism on GPI (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:7180). Although the amidated dimethylated dipeptide analogue 14 had high Ki delta (0.31 nM) and excellent antagonist activity (pA2 = 9.9; Ke = 0.12 nM), the increased activity toward mu receptors in the absence of a free acid function at the C-terminus revealed modest delta selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 1655) and somewhat comparable bioactivity (GPI/MVD = 4500). Thus, the data demonstrate that N,N-(Me)2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) retained high delta receptor affinities and delta selectivities and acquired enhanced potency in pharmacological bioassays on MVD greater than that of other peptide or non-peptide delta antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756438,20181015,5485199,103193883,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9301674,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

For many years efforts to obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by replacing the carboxylic acid group of GABA or baclofen derivatives with either the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity relationships of the novel GABAB agonists are discussed with respect to their affinities to GABAB receptors as well as to their effects in many functional tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756442,20181014,5230|5310933,103334318|103334994,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650684,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists.

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758205,20181016,5360515,131283791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

152408,Confirmatory,Opioid receptors antagonist activity in smooth-muscle tissue of guinea pig ileum (GPI),"Title: Design and synthesis of highly potent and selective cyclic dynorphin A analogues._||_Abstract: We have designed and synthesized several cyclic disulfide-containing peptide analogues of dynorphin A (Dyn A) which are conformationally constrained in the putative 'address' segment of the opioid ligand. Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor. The lack of correlation between the pharmacological profiles observed in smooth muscle and in the brain binding assays suggests the existence of different subtypes of the kappa and mu opioid receptors in the brain and peripheral nervous systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756021,20181012,10102939|10677974|15160017|16133805|25079852|25087514|25087515|25087516,103173862|103241413|103241617|103241618|103241619|103241662|103241663|103241664,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1972964,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

226070,Confirmatory,Opioid receptor agonistic potency in guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle(GPI) preparation,"Title: Opioid agonist and antagonist activities of peripherally selective derivatives of naltrexamine and oxymorphamine._||_Abstract: A series of beta-naltrexamine and beta-oxymorphamine derivatives that contain ionizable moieties coupled to the 6 beta-amino group were synthesized in an effort to develop antagonists and agonists that have negligible access into the central nervous system (CNS). Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

These ligands were of interest in our investigation of the relationship between the structure of the ester function and the ability to irreversibly block mu opioid receptors. While all of the ligands were potent reversible agonists in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, most appeared to behave as irreversible antagonists of morphine. The benzyl 5 and phenethyl 6 esters possessed irreversible mu antagonist potency that was of similar magnitude to that of beta-FNA in the GPI. In the MVD, all esters appeared to irreversibly block the agonist effect of morphine, but none of the compounds irreversibly antagonized [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin to a significant degree.

Substitutions in position 3._||_Abstract: cyclo[d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-13)NH(2) (Dap, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid; Dyn A, dynorphin A), synthesized previously in our laboratory, showed sub-nanomolar affinity for kappa opioid receptors and potent agonist activity in the guinea pig ileum assay (Arttamangkul et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 2410-2417). Various modifications were made in position 3 of cyclo[d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) that could influence the opioid receptor affinity, selectivity, and/or efficacy of this peptide. An optimized orthogonal synthetic strategy was developed for the synthesis of these cyclic peptides in which the final peptides could be cleaved from the solid support with trifluoroacetic acid. Substitutions of Gly(3) by Ala, d-Ala, Trp, and d-Trp in cyclo[d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) and its linear counterpart [d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) were generally well tolerated by both kappa and micro opioid receptors.

The L- and D-Homophe4 (homophenylalanine) analogues of [D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 were compared to the (R)- and (S)-Atc4 (2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid) derivatives (Aldrich et al. Chirality 2001, 13, 125-129). [l-Homophe4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the D-Homophe4 isomer, while [(R)-Atc4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the (S)-Atc4 isomer. Comparing the structure of Atc to those of Phe and Homophe, these results suggest that the Atc isomers are functioning more as constrained Homophe rather than Phe analogues in these Dyn A derivatives. The higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity of the (R)-Atc4 analogue suggests that Phe4 of Dyn A most likely adopts a gauche (-) or trans conformation in the kappa-opioid receptor binding site. Comparison of [D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 derivatives containing Aic4 (2-aminoindan-2-carboxylic acid) and Tic4 (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) with the peptides containing their acyclic counterparts alpha-MePhe4 and N-MePhe4, respectively, suggest that the loss in opioid receptor affinity seen for the Aic4 and Tic4 analogues is probably due to an improper orientation of the aromatic ring in these residues. Most of the analogues in this series showed much lower affinity for delta-opioid receptors than the parent peptide, suggesting that kappa- and delta-opioid receptors have distinct binding pockets for the residue at position 4 of Dyn A. All of the analogues with high affinity for kappa-opioid receptors exhibited full agonist activity in the adenylyl cyclase assay using cloned kappa-opioid receptors, indicating that changes in the position or orientation of the phenyl ring in this residue did not alter the ability of the peptides to activate the receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849183,20181017,44352391,103363308,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12954053,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors. Analogues (3 and 6-8) which were shown to have relatively weak delta-opioid receptor antagonist potency have their aromatic groups located in a space that is different from that of the more potent analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL871690,20200703,5491688,103734772,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8126697,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849052,20181016,44324324,103300947,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group.

The C-glycoside 3 was prepared with the objective of examining a metabolically stable analogue of morphine-6-glucuronide and determining the potency and selectivity of opioid receptor binding. Competition binding assays showed that 3 bound to the mu opioid receptor with a Ki value of 3.5 nM. The C-glycoside 3 exhibited delta/mu and kappa/mu selectivity ratios of 76 and 165, respectively. The synthetic intermediate (i.e., benzyl precursor, compound 11) bound to the mu opioid receptor with a Ki value of 0.5 nM, was less selective for the mu opioid receptor. The [35S]GTPgammaS assay was used to evaluate the functional properties of compounds 3 and 11. Compound 3 was determined to be a full agonist at the mu opioid receptor, whereas compound 11 was found to be a partial agonist. Compound 3 was determined to be very stable in the presence of human liver S9, and rat and monkey liver microsomes: no detectable loss of 3 was observed up to 90 min.

The initially reported tryptamine analogues displayed either poor solution stability, potent central nervous system activity, or both of these undesirable characteristics and were unacceptable for clinical evaluation. A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

We have recently developed a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based approach to monitor G(i)-protein activation in living cells. Here we report that this technique can be used to determine structure-activity relationships of receptor agonists in intact cells. We have recently shown that morphine is biosynthesized de novo by mammals via a multistep pathway different from that in plants. However, the pharmacological properties of morphine precursors are poorly understood. Here, we directly monitored mu-opioid receptor (MOR)-mediated G(i)-protein activation in living cells by FRET and validated this method with classical GTPgammaS binding assays. Receptor binding studies and FRET measurements demonstrated that several (R)-configurated morphine precursors such as (R)-reticuline, salutaridine, salutaridinol, thebaine, and codeine were partial MOR agonists.

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970720,20181026,5462471,103217856,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14-21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later. Protection by a rapidly cleared reagent indicates that norBNI did not persist at the site of action. In vitro binding of [(3)H]U69,593 to KOR showed that K(d) and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact. Consistent with the concept that the long-lasting effects might be caused by a functional disruption of KOR signaling, both norBNI and JDTic were found to stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing KOR-GFP but not in untransfected cells. Similarly, norBNI increased phospho-JNK in both the striatum and spinal cord in wild type mice but not in KOR knock-out mice. Pretreatment of mice with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 before norBNI attenuated the long acting antagonism. Together, these results suggest that the long duration KOR antagonists disrupt KOR signaling by activating JNK.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL977786,20181025,5480230,103698780,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17702750,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However, most opioids currently available have a variety of side-effects as well as exhibiting tolerance. Tolerance is most likely to be a complex phenomenon, however, the role of receptor internalisation is thought to play a crucial role. In this study, we examined the role of aromaticity in ligand-mediated receptor internalisation of the mu-opioid receptor (MOPR). These studies show that the amount of receptor internalisation may be dependant on the amphiphilicity of the ligand.

Analogues were assessed for mu-opioid receptor affinity, inhibition of cAMP accumulation, enzymatic stability, and permeability across Caco-2 cell monolayers. C-terminus modification decreased receptor affinity, while N-terminus C8-Laa improved stability and permeability with slight change in receptor affinity.

We conducted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies on COS cells coexpressing MOP and CCK2 receptors to determine whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in such modulation. These studies revealed the absence of constitutive or monovalent ligand-induced heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of MOP and CCK2 receptors therefore is unlikely to be responsible for the opposing effects between morphine and CCK in the CNS. However, association was induced, as indicated by a positive BRET signal, on exposure of the cells to bivalent ligands containing mu-opioid agonist and CCK2 receptor antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers containing 16-22 atoms but not with a shorter (9-atom) spacer. These studies demonstrate for the first time that an appropriately designed bivalent ligand is capable of inducing association of G-protein-coupled receptors.

The discoveries of BW373U86 (1) and SNC80 (2) contributed to the rapid expansion of research in this field. However, poor drug-like properties and low therapeutic indices have prevented clinical evaluation of these agents. Doses of 1 and 2 similar to those required for analgesic activity produce convulsions in rodents and nonhuman primates. Recently, we described a novel series of potent, selective, and orally bioavailable delta opioid receptor agonists. The lead derivative, ADL5859 (4), is currently in phase II proof-of-concept studies for the management of pain. Further structure activity relationship exploration has led to the discovery of ADL5747 (36), which is approximately 50-fold more potent than 4 in an animal model of inflammatory pain.

434694,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]DAMGO from human mu opioid receptor expressed in CHO cells by liquid scintillation counting,"Title: Design, synthesis, and characterization of 6beta-naltrexol analogs, and their selectivity for in vitro opioid receptor subtypes._||_Abstract: Since the mu opioid receptor (MOR) is known to be involved in the therapeutically relevant pathways leading to the manifestation of pain and addiction, we are currently studying the specific structural characteristics that promote antagonism at the MOR. The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR. Additionally, data also suggest that increasing the bulk around C(6) may allow control of subtype selectivity within these compound series.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1063595,20180911,44188273|45110000|45269407|45270231|45271055,103683498|103685209|103686977|103688766|103694091,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19364645,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Historically, many of these drugs have multiple mechanisms of action including calcium and sodium channel blockade as well as GABAergic activity and thus a number of associated side effects. Modulation of the M-current through opening of KCNQ channels has been proposed as a way to attenuate neuroexcitability and have a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of seizure disorders. Therefore, as part of our program to identify new treatments for epilepsy, we set out to identify agonists of KCNQ channels. High throughput screening of our corporate collection led to the identification of 1, adamantane-1-carboxylic acid (3-methyl-3H-benzothiazol-2-ylidine) hydrazide, a potent KCNQ2/Q3 agonist.

Here we describe the isolation and pharmacological characterization of four novel, neurologically active purines 1-4, isolated from Haplosclerida sponges collected in the Republic of Palau. The structures were determined by analyses of spectral and X-ray data. Compound 1 induced convulsions upon intracerebroventricular injection into mice, with a CD50 value of 2.4 nmol/mouse. Purines 2-4 were active in mouse bioassays at higher doses. The seizurogenic activity of 1 was correlated with inhibition of neuronal GABAergic transmission, with only a modest impact on excitatory signaling, in electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons. Despite having a purine template structure, the inhibitory activity of 1 was not prevented by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Thus, 1 represents a novel substituted purine that elicits convulsions through its actions on inhibitory neurotransmission. These 8-oxoisoguanine analogs comprise a new family of compounds closely related in structure to endogenous neurosignaling molecules and commonly used CNS stimulants.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1247783,20180914,46915369,123092509,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20681583,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640636,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands.

Microwave-assisted methods were developed and successfully employed, aiding in functionalizing the chemically sensitive salvinorin A scaffold. This demonstrates the first reported results for both cycloaddition of the furan ring and functionalization via microwave-assisted methodology of the salvinorin A skeleton. The cycloadducts yielded herein introduce electron-withdrawing substituents and bulky aromatic groups into the C-12 position. Kappa opioid (KOP) receptor space was explored through aromatization of the bent oxanorbornadiene system possessed by the cycloadducts to a planar phenyl ring system. Although dimethyl- and diethylcarboxylate analogues 5 and 6 retain some affinity and selectivity for KOP receptors and are full agonists, their aromatized counterparts 13 and 14 have reduced affinity for KOP receptors. The methods developed herein signify a novel approach toward rapidly probing the structure-activity relationships of furan-containing natural products.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1775894,20180918,128563,103457931,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21338114,0,,P35372,,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Although the N-phenethyl substituent showed much greater affinity for μ- and κ-opioid receptors than their N-methyl relatives (e.g., K(i)=167 nM and 171 nM at μ- and κ-receptors vs >2800 and 7500 nM for the N-methyl ortho-a oxide-bridged phenylmorphan), the a-isomers were not examined further because of their relatively low affinity. The N-phenethyl substituted ortho-b and para-b oxide-bridged phenylmorphans were also synthesized and their enantiomers were obtained using supercritical fluid chromatography.

A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays.

The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity.

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects. These novel chemical entities could potentially be advanced to the clinic as new drug candidates for treating depression.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026508,20200626,45254040|56951368|56951495,160678244|160688954|160705128,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22171543,0,,P35372,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

However, their central administration led to the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Conjugation of C-terminal substance P (SP) fragments to opioids and opioid peptides was previously shown to produce hybrid peptides with strong analgesic activity, with low or no propensity to develop tolerance. In this study, four peptides (2-5) comprised of endomorphin-1 (1) and C-terminal fragments of SP (four or five amino acids, SP(8-11) (2) or SP(7-11) (4), respectively), with an overlapping Phe residue, were synthesized. To overcome low metabolic stability and poor membrane permeability of the peptide, the N-terminus of 2 and 4 was further modified with a C10-carbon lipoamino acid (C10LAA) achieving 3 and 5, respectively. LAA-modification of the hybrid peptides resulted in a significant increase in metabolic stability and membrane permeability compared to peptides 1, 2 and 4. Compound 5 showed potent μ-opioid receptor binding affinity (K(iμ)=3.87 ± 0.51 nM) with dose-dependent agonist activity in the nanomolar range (IC(50)=45 ± 13 nM).

727334,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to human cloned MOR in presence of Na+/GDP,"Title: Development of κ opioid receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: κ opioid receptors (KORs) belong to the G-protein-coupled class of receptors (GPCRs). They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function.

Since the finding that salvinorin A exerts its potent psychotropic actions through the activation of opioid receptors, the site of action of morphine and related analogues, there has been much interest in elucidating the underlying mechanisms behind its effects. These effects are particularly remarkable because (1) salvinorin A is the first reported non-nitrogenous opioid receptor agonist and (2) its effects are not mediated through the previously investigated targets of psychotomimetics. This Perspective outlines our research program, illustrating a new direction to the development of tools to further elucidate the biological mechanisms of drug tolerance and dependence.

Following the chromatographic separation of the methyl erythro- and threo-4-nitro-3R- and 3S-phenylpentanoate diastereoisomers, target compounds were obtained by their reductive cyclisation into 5-methyl-4-phenylpyrrolidin-2-one enantiomers and the attachment of the acetamide group to the heterocyclic nitrogen. Experiments with electrically stimulated rat vas deference contractions induced by the PRE-084, an agonist of sigma-1 receptor, showed that (4R,5S)- and (4R,5R)-2-(5-methyl-4-phenyl-2-oxopyrrolidin-1-yl)-acetamides with an R-configuration at the C-4 chiral centre in the 2-pyrrolidone ring were more effective positive allosteric modulators of sigma-1 receptor than were their optical antipodes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2395968,20180927,52912210,174496375,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23582449,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Specifically, at least two alkaloids isolated from the plant Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine ((E)-2-[(2S,3S)-3-ethyl-8-methoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b-octahydroindolo[3,2-h]quinolizin-2-yl]-3-methoxyprop-2-enoic acid methyl ester; 9-methoxy coryantheidine; MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG), and several synthetic analogues of these natural products display centrally mediated (supraspinal and spinal) antinociceptive (analgesic) activity in various pain models. Several characteristics of these compounds suggest a classic 'opioid' mechanism of action: nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors, competitive interaction with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, and two-way analgesic cross-tolerance with morphine. However, other characteristics of the compounds suggest novelty, particularly chemical structure and possible greater separation from side effects.

A high throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, led to the discovery of a non-peptidic β-arrestin biased agonist for NTR1. The lead compound, 2-cyclopropyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- piperazin-1-yl)quinazoline, 32 (ML314), exhibits full agonist behavior against NTR1 (EC50 = 2.0 μM) in the primary assay and selectivity against NTR2. The effect of 32 is blocked by the NTR1 antagonist SR142948A in a dose dependent manner. Unlike peptide based NTR1 agonists, compound 32 has no significant response in a Ca(2+) mobilization assay and is thus a biased agonist that activates the β-arrestin pathway rather than the traditional G q coupled pathway. This bias has distinct biochemical and functional consequences that may lead to physiological advantages.

Both compounds displayed high binding affinity and selectivity to the mu opioid receptor. To further study the interaction of these two ligands with the three opioid receptors, the recently released opioid receptor crystal structures were employed in docking studies to further test our original hypothesis that the ligands recognize a unique 'address' domain in the mu opioid receptor involving Trp318 that facilitates their selectivity. These modeling results were supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies on the mu opioid receptor, where the mutants Y210A and W318A confirmed the role of the latter in binding.

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor. Thus, the analog with a 17-(3-ethoxypropyl) group showed the best selectively and potent agonistic activity for the δ receptor among KNT-127 derivatives.

The lack of small molecule non-peptidic Y2 receptor modulators suitable as in vivo pharmacological tools hampered the progress to uncover the precise pharmacological role of Y2.

A bivalent ligand 1 with a 21-atom spacer was thus synthesized and explicitly characterized as a novel pharmacological probe to study the underlying mechanism of opioid-enhanced NeuroAIDS. The steric hindrance generated from the spacer affected the binding affinity and Ca(2+) flux inhibition function activity of bivalent ligand 1 at the chemokine receptor CCR5 more profoundly than it did at the mu opioid receptor (MOR). However, the CCR5 radioligand binding affinity and the Ca(2+) flux inhibition function of the ligand seemed not necessarily to correlate with its antiviral activity given that it was at least two times more potent than maraviroc alone in reducing Tat expression upon HIV-1 infection in human astrocytes.

Therefore bivalent ligand 1 seemed to function more effectively by targeting specifically the putative MOR-CCR5 heterodimer in the viral invasion process.

In order to gain a better understanding of the contribution that the 3- and 4-methyl groups make to the pure antagonist properties of 2a,b, we synthesized analogues of 2a,b that lacked the 4-methyl (5a,b), 3-methyl (6a,b), and both the 3- and 4-methyl group (7a,b) and compared their opioid receptor properties. We found that (1) all N-methyl and N-phenylpropyl substituted compounds were nonselective opioid antagonists (2) all N-phenylpropyl analogues were more potent than their N-methyl counterparts, and (3) compounds 2a,b which have both a 3- and 4-methyl substituent, were more potent antagonists than analogues 5a,b, 6a,b, and 7a,b.

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285643,20200618,90678812|90678814,242640974|242640976,4985|4986|4988,,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts.

These include the potential for receptor selectivity, maintenance of the temporal and spatial fidelity of signaling in vivo, the ceiling effect of the allosteric cooperativity which may prevent overdose issues, and engendering bias by differentially modulating distinct signaling pathways. Here we describe the discovery, synthesis, and molecular pharmacology of δ-opioid receptor-selective positive allosteric modulators (δ PAMs). These δ PAMs increase the affinity and/or efficacy of the orthosteric agonists leu-enkephalin, SNC80 and TAN67, as measured by receptor binding, G protein activation, β-arrestin recruitment, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation.

Two series of glycopeptides were assessed for opioid receptor binding affinity. Attempts to alter the mu-selectivity of [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO)-related glycopeptides by altering the charged residues of the amphipathic helical address were unsuccessful. A series of pan-agonists was evaluated for antinociceptive activity (55 °C tail flick) in mice. A flexible linker was required to maintain antinociceptive activity. Circular dichroism (CD) in H2O, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and SDS micelles confirmed the importance of the amphipathic helices (11s → 11sG → 11) for antinociception.

These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

N/OFQ and NOP receptor have important roles on a variety of physiological, pathophysiological, regulatory, and dysregulatory mechanisms in the living body. Both activation and blockade of NOP receptor function have displayed clinical potential of NOP receptor agonists and antagonists for the treatment of various diseases or pathophysiological conditions, respectively. Potent and selective NOP receptor agonists/antagonists are also useful tools to investigate the various mechanisms mediated by NOP receptor-N/OFQ system. As the present study, a series of (4-arylpiperidine substituted-methyl)-[bicyclic (hetero)cycloalkanobenzene] analogs was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated in vitro to seek and identify potent and selective, small-molecules of nonpeptide NOP receptor antagonists, which resulted in the discovery of novel potent small-molecule 15 with high human NOP receptor selectivity over human μ receptor. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the potency and selectivity, structure-metabolic stability relationship (SMR), and SAR of hERG (human ether-a-go-go related gene) potassium ion channel binding affinity for the analogs in the present studies in vitro provided or suggested significant and/or useful structural determinants and insights for the respective purposes.

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine.

Pharmacological intervention has focused on molecules that decrease NRF2-ubiquitination through covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues, but such electrophilic compounds lack selectivity and may be associated with off-target toxicity. We report here the first use of a fragment-based approach to directly target the KEAP1 Kelch-NRF2 interaction.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed. Compounds with a phenolic 4-hydroxy group do not form the hydrogen bond with His291, an important residue for KOP affinity and agonist activity. The size of the N-substituent hosted by the hydrophobic pocket formed by Val108, Ile316 and Tyr320 considerably influences binding and selectivity, with the n-alkyl size limit being five carbon atoms, while bulky substituents turn KOP agonists in antagonists. Thus, combination of experimental and molecular modeling strategies provides an initial framework for understanding the structural features of diphenethylamines that are essential to promote binding affinity and selectivity for the KOP receptor, and may be involved in transduction of the ligand binding event into molecular changes, ultimately leading to receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3858679,20200624,122589952|134139387|134147031,374283991|374295165|374322756,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27567368,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We thus designed a series of variable-length (15-41 atoms) bivalent linked peptides with selective but moderate/low-affinity pharmacophores for the mu and delta opioid receptors. We observed a U-shaped MDOR potency/affinity profile in vitro, with the 24-atom spacer length (D24M) producing the highest MDOR potency/affinity (<1 nM) and selectivity (≥89-fold). We further evaluated D24M in mice and observed that D24M dose-dependently antagonized tail flick antinociception produced by the MDOR agonists CYM51010 and Deltorphin-II, without antagonizing the monomer agonists DAMGO and DSLET. We also observed that D24M sharply reduced withdrawal behavior in models of acute and chronic morphine dependence. These findings suggest that D24M is a first-in-class high-potency MDOR-selective antagonist both in vitro and in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4145312,20200618,11498201|145952136|145952209|145952964|145956549|145958618|145959553,103505604|404655772|404655869|404656984|404662139|404665137|404666467,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29939746,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

In a four step synthesis the methyl acetals 6 were converted into fluoroethyl derivatives 13 and 30. The most promising σ2 receptor ligand is the methyl acetal 6a bearing a 2,4-dimethylbenzylamino moiety. The fluoroethyl derivatives 13c and 13d reveal high σ1 affinity but moderate selectivity over the σ2 subtype. In mice 13c and 13d showed antiallodynic activity that is stronger than that of the reference σ1 antagonist BD-1063 (34). Since the antiallodynic activity of 13c could only be partially reversed by the σ1 agonist PRE-084 (35), it is postulated that a second mechanism contributes to its overall antiallodynic effect. In contrast, the antiallodynic effect of its diastereomer 13d can be totally explained by a σ1 antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4158755,20200618,145950456|145954168|145957598,404653361|404658708|404663690,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30350997,0,,P35372,9606,,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

Modification of the 17-amino side chain of the opioid ligand to an arylsulfonyl group and the 6-furan acrylamide chain to 2-pyridyl acrylamide led to compound 71 with improvement of the antagonist activity (OX1R, Ki = 1.36 nM; OX2R, not active) without any detectable affinity for the opioid receptor.

The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models.

The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) has emerged as a promising target for both indications, raising demand for new chemotypes of KOR antagonists as well as G-protein-biased agonists. We employed the crystal structure of the KOR-JDTic complex and ligand-optimized structural templates to perform virtual screening of available compound libraries for new KOR ligands. The prospective virtual screening campaign yielded a high 32% hit rate, identifying novel fragment-like and lead-like chemotypes of KOR ligands. A round of optimization resulted in 11 new submicromolar KOR binders (best Ki = 90 nM). Functional assessment confirmed at least two compounds as potent KOR antagonists, while compound 81 was identified as a potent Gi biased agonist for KOR with minimal β-arrestin recruitment.

In a second campaign, κ-opioid receptor ligands were sought with selectivity versus the μ-opioid receptor. While hit rates ranged from 40% to 63% against the on-targets, they were just as good against the antitargets, even though the molecules were selected for their putative lack of binding to the off-targets. Affinities, too, were often as good or better for the off-targets. Even though it was occasionally possible to find selective molecules, such as a mid-nanomolar D2/5-HT2A ligand with 21-fold selectivity versus the H1 receptor, this was the exception.

Contrary to the classical monomeric model, indirect evidence suggests that ORs might form dimers, which could be endowed with a distinct pharmacological profile, and, thus, be targeted to develop innovative pharmacological therapies. However, direct evidence for the spontaneous formation of OR dimers in living cells under physiological conditions is missing. Despite a growing interest in the κ opioid receptor (KOR), KOR-selective fluorescent probes are particularly scarce in the literature. Herein, we present the first set of fluorescent KOR-selective probes with antagonistic properties. Two of these were employed in single-molecule microscopy (SMM) experiments to investigate KOR homodimerization, localization, and trafficking. Our findings indicate that most KORs labeled with the new fluorescent probes are present as apparently freely diffusing monomers on the surface of a simple cell model.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4344750,20210302,155512955|155527564|155529675|155539216|155565113,440113439|440135841|440139084|440154210|440218641,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32159953,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

GPCR ligands that differentially activate the downstream signaling pathways are termed functionally selective or biased ligands. A class of novel non-catechol G protein-biased agonists of the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) was recently disclosed. We conducted the first comprehensive structure-functional selectivity relationship study measuring G<sub>S</sub> and β-arrestin2 recruitment activities focused on four regions of this scaffold, resulting in over 50 analogs with diverse functional selectivity profiles. Some compounds became potent full agonists of β-arrestin2 recruitment, while others displayed enhanced G<sub>S</sub> bias compared to the starting compound. Pharmacokinetic testing of an analog with an altered functional selectivity profile demonstrated excellent blood-brain barrier penetration.

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM). Most of the synthesized ligands reveal either similar GluN2B and σ<sub>1</sub> affinity or higher σ<sub>1</sub> affinity than GluN2B affinity. The methyl ether 16b shows high σ<sub>1</sub> affinity (K<sub>i</sub>(σ<sub>1</sub>) = 6.6 nM) and high selectivity over a broad panel of receptors and transporters.

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies.

Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats.

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430768,20210302,104787|3036289|5462471|123445395|155515838|155522689|155530357|155553117|155558752|155563934,103202725|103217856|123099351|336866137|440117795|440128385|440140127|440188464|440202620|440215673,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,,P35372,9606,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

These results support the hypothesis that mixed MOR agonist/DOR antagonist ligands may emerge as novel opioid analgesics with reduced side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4630064,20210802,5462471|71460942|156009506|156009540|156010407|156010419|156010471|156010916|156010967|156011033|156011089|156011211|156011239|156012508|156012937|156013730|156013796|156014399|156014654|156015003|156015005|156015418|156016017|156016282|156017329|156017544|156017670|156017849|156018208|156018361|156019147|156019389|156019450|156019589|156020282|156020566|156020570|156020668|156020774|156020790|156020805|156021226|156021519|156021606|156022093|156022148|156022239,103217856|163335413|442046440|442046483|442047696|442047711|442047779|442048375|442048452|442048539|442048619|442048785|442048823|442050539|442051166|442052278|442052368|442053216|442053572|442054108|442054110|442054746|442055666|442056049|442057511|442057808|442057983|442058231|442058732|442058939|442060055|442060391|442060478|442060678|442061670|442062079|442062083|442062225|442062374|442062401|442062424|442063009|442063478|442063594|442064290|442064400|442064567,4988,,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32530286,0,,P35372,9606,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent. Finding a specific agent that increase KCC2 function would potentially have therapeutic value, as increased KCC2 function reduces susceptibility to epileptic seizures.",23,Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening Facility,ED001_Antag_MDS,20090528,25067404,56405461,134|135|140|146|150|153|154|623|624|1128|1129|1131|1134|1136|1812|1813|1814|1815|1909|1910|2099|2550|2908|3269|3274|3350|3757|4543|4886|4887|4985|4986|4988|5734|6530|6531|6532|6869|10280|10800|14811|16177|24173|24208|24408|24410|25265|25399|29336|29412|29559|29709|81574|81812|83612|84109|257648|306255|101823647,,AAD14378|NP_000015|NP_000070|NP_000106|NP_000116|NP_000229|NP_000515|NP_000614|NP_000665|NP_000666|NP_000669|NP_000672|NP_000675|NP_000701|NP_000729|NP_000730|NP_000731|NP_000734|NP_000785|NP_000787|NP_000788|NP_000900|NP_000901|NP_000902|NP_000903|NP_000905|NP_000949|NP_001018087|NP_001034|NP_001035|NP_001036|NP_001049|NP_001091683|NP_001461|NP_001948|NP_005857|NP_005949|NP_006630|NP_032196|NP_032388|NP_036634|NP_036706|NP_036932|NP_037051|NP_057658|NP_058687|NP_058706|NP_058887|NP_058937|NP_071640|NP_110502|NP_112258|NP_112396|NP_113970|NP_671482|NP_899156|NP_937822|P49658|XP_001057307,NIH Initiatives,19279215,0,3.2.2.6,AAD14378|NP_037051|NP_058687|NP_671482|O35458|P02708|P03372|P04150|P04774|P07550|P08172|P08588|P08908|P08913|P11229|P13504|P14416|P15207|P18508|P20309|P21728|P21917|P22756|P23975|P24530|P25021|P25100|P25101|P25103|P25929|P29274|P30411|P30542|P31645|P32297|P35367|P35372|P35408|P35436|P35439|P35462|P41143|P41145|P43140|P46663|P48039|P49146|P49651|P49658|P63059|Q00960|Q01959|Q12809|Q96P65|Q99720|Q9R0C9|Q9UBS5|Q9Y271|XP_001057307,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1
1921,Other,Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Colleen Niswender_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator(PAM)_||_Grant Number: MH077607-1_||_To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3).

In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6).

These responses are mediated through high-affinity interactions with five members of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family of plasma membrane-localized G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the sphingosine lipid receptors, S1P1-5 (8-10). S1P3 receptor couples promiscuously to Gi, Gq, and G12/13 proteins (11-13). Its expression is widespread (14-16). The S1P3 knockout mouse is phenotypically normal (14). Most S1P-mediated responses on endothelial cells occur via the S1P1 receptor alone or in combination with the S1P3 receptor. Bradycardia and hypertension are clearly associated with S1P3 activation and its expression patterns in cardiac tissue (3, 17). The use of the S1P1-selective agonist SEW2871 together with S1P3-deletant mice showed that activation of S1P3 regulates sinus rhythm, whereas activation of S1P1 plays no discernable role in the process (4). S1P3 on dendritic cells has been identified as a major exacerbating factor for mortality during sepsis by playing a role in the critical linkage of inflammation and coagulation pathways downstream of the thrombin cascade (18). A potent and selective S1P3 agonist would be useful in dissecting the complexities of S1P-mediated physiological processes in which S1P3 is involved, including bradycardia and hypertension._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function (1, 2). In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 (3). Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain(4). These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (5-7)._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Jeffrey Conn_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor_||_Grant Number: 1 R03 MH077606-01_||_The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively modulate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_Summary of Probe Development Effort:_||_This probe development effort is focused on the identification of inverse agonists of heterodimerization of the mu 1 (OPRM1) and delta 1 (OPRD1) opioid receptors.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Galphai and Galphao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively modulate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use. The goal of this project is identification of HTR5A inverse agonists._||_References:_||_1. Raehal KM, Bohn LM. Mu opioid receptor regulation and opiate responsiveness.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function (1, 2). In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 (3). Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain(4). These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (5-7)._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function (1, 2). In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 (3). Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain(4). These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (5-7)._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.
