1,45419,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]spiperone from CHO-K1 cell membranes expressing human dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Evaluation of the effects of the enantiomers of reduced haloperidol, azaperol, and related 4-amino-1-arylbutanols on dopamine and sigma receptors._||_Abstract: The enantiomers of reduced haloperidol (3a), azaperol (3b), and the related compound BMY-14802 (3c) were prepared in high optical purity. The affinity of these compounds for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and sigma S1 and S2 sites was determined in vitro. Both enantiomers of 3a display greatly decreased affinity for D2 and D3 receptors compared to haloperidol, although they still possess affinities in the 100-200-nM range. Both enantiomers of 3a possess potent and equal affinity for S1 sites (Ki: 1-2 nM), only slightly weaker than haloperidol (Ki: 0.33 nM). At S2 sites, (R)-(+)-3a displays similar affinity to haloperidol (Ki: 31 and 26 nM, respectively), while (S)-(-)-3a is slight more potent (Ki: 8.2 nM). The stereoselectivity profile of the enantiomers of 3b at D2 and D3 receptors is quite similar to that of 3a, (S)-(-)-3b being about 4 times more potent than its enantiomer at both receptors. (R)-(+)-3b binds preferentially to sigma S1 over S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3b displays the opposite selectivity profile. Both enantiomers of 3c possess very weak affinity for D2 and D3 receptors. In a manner similar to the enantiomers of 3b, the affinity of (R)-(+)-3c is greater for S1 than S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3c displays the opposite selectivity profile. Following parenteral administration of both enantiomers of 3a, dopamine synthesis and turnover in rat striatum, cortex, and mesolimbic areas were increased, in a manner similar to the effects produced by haloperidol itself. Additional studies will be required to assess with certainty whether the effects were due to the compounds themselves or simply were a consequence of the in vivo oxidation to haloperidol.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL651364,20181014,3559|15443|6604868|10020651|16048564|24867245|44350942|44350991,103167216|103359590|103359652|103359654|103359671|103359710|103359798|103359799,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7902870,0,,P14416,9606.0,198.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
2,49735,Literature-derived,Antagonism of apomorphine induced inhibition of the tachycardia produced by stimulation of the right cardioaccelerator nerve in cat.,"Title: Assessment of a potential dopaminergic prodrug moiety in several ring systems._||_Abstract: The ortho hydroxy/methyl, hydroxy/hydroxymethyl, hydroxy/formyl, and hydroxy/carboxy substitution patterns, some of which confer dopaminergic agonist effects upon 2-aminotetralin ring systems, have been incorporated into beta-phenethylamine, 2-aminoindan, and trans-octahydrobenzo[f]quinoline rings. Certain of the 2-aminoindan derivatives displayed pharmacologic properties consistent with their being dopaminergic agonists. The beta-phenethylamine derivative did not show any significant dopamine-like activity. The 7-hydroxy-8-methyloctahydrobenzo[f]quinoline derivative 4a was a moderately potent, short-acting DA2 receptor antagonist. All of the carboxylic acid derivatives were inert. Of the ortho hydroxy/methyl derivatives, only the 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-aminotetralin derivative displayed pharmacological properties consistent with its being a dopaminergic prodrug. It is concluded that 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (1a) is structurally unique for a dopaminergic drug.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL661208,20200628,6005|145954|10083326|44303823|44303825|44303826|44303827|44303828|44303830|44303832|44303845|44303865|44303869|44303870|44303872|44304062,103167211|103252888|103252908|103252910|103252911|103252912|103252913|103252915|103252916|103252937|103252957|103252961|103252962|103252963|103252965|103253393,1812|1813|1814|1815|1816,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3761320,0,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,9685.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Potential nondopaminergic antagonists of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis._||_Abstract: A series of new substituted benzamides has been synthesized and evaluated for dopamine antagonist activity and for antagonism of cisplatin-induced emesis in the dog and in the ferret. It was found that modification of the 2-methoxy substituent of metoclopramide was detrimental to dopaminergic D2 antagonism but not necessarily to antagonism of cisplatin-induced emesis. A number of analogues having a beta-keto, beta-hydroxy, beta-methoxy, beta-imino, or beta-unsaturated alkyloxy substituent instead of methoxy have shown equal or superior protection from emesis to that of metoclopramide. At the same time these compounds were found to be free of dopaminergic D2 antagonism in both in vitro ([3H]spiperone binding) and in vivo tests (rat catalepsy, antagonism of apomorphine-induced stereotypy in the rat, and apomorphine-induced emesis in the dog).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL666484,20181012,14116897,103217304,1813,In vivo,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3397992,0,,P14416,9615.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

These selective ligands may be effective antipsychotics without extrapyramidal side effects. This work describes the synthesis of a new series of 2,4-disubstituted morpholines and 2,4-disubstituted 1,4-oxazepanes with selectivity for the dopamine D(4) receptor. A 3D-QSAR analysis using the GRID/GOLPE methodology was performed with the purpose to get a better understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity. Inspection of the coefficient plots allowed us to identify that regions which are important for affinity are situated around the two benzene ring systems, a p-chlorobenzyl group, and the aliphatic amine belonging to the morpholine or 1,4-oxazepane system. In addition, the size of the morpholine or 1,4-oxazepane ring seems to be important for affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673018,20181017,10249308|11151135|11152225|11153076|11156017|11164922|11176211|11187628|11233944|11245414|11280787|11290928|11292776|11303390|11314005|11315028|11328099|11338828|11348526|11360382|11360927|11372852|11382447|11383473|11393899|11405182|11406804|11407122|11417804|11417962|11428005|11428416|11464857|11474021|11750030|11774177|11774358|18403576|44335569|44335635|71456214,103323450|103323451|103323489|103323495|103323524|103323525|103323528|103323598|103323599|103323600|103323626|103323630|103323637|103323638|103323639|103323640|103323641|103323676|103323848|103323849|103323851|103323889|103323891|103323956|103323959|103323962|103323963|103323970|103324085|103324113|103324200|103324202|103324234|103324236|103324238|103324299|103324302|103324331|103324333|103324458|163326263,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15163190,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Using the two complementary design strategies based on two similarity concepts described in the previous paper, we have obtained analogues with IC(50) values ranging between 0.9 nM and a few micromolar on the mu receptor and displaying qualitatively different profiles.

Changes in the aromatic ring linked to N-1 piperazine ring led to the identification of 2-methoxyphenyl and 2,3-dichlorophenyl derivatives (compounds 6 and 13) displaying moderate D(3) affinity (K(i) = 145 and 31 nM, respectively). Intermediate alkyl chain elongation in compounds 1, 6, and 13 improved binding affinity for the D(3) receptor and decreased the D(4) affinity (compounds 18-26). Among these latter compounds, the N-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (19) was further modified with the replacement or of the 2,3-dichlorophenyl moiety (compounds 27-30) or of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring (compounds 31-41). In this way, we identified several high-affinity D(3) ligands (0.13 nM < K(i)'s < 4.97 nM) endowed with high selectivity over D(2), D(4), 5-HT(1A), and alpha(1) receptors. In addition, N-[4-[4-(2,3-dimethylphenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (27) and N-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]-7-methoxy-2-benzofurancarboxamide (41) appear to be valuable candidates for positron emission tomography (PET) because of their affinity values, lipophilicity properties, and liability of (11)C labeling in the O-methyl position.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670115,20181017,778880|10783358|10811814|10861560|10926404|10948748|11016342|11036114|11090403|44369020|71449110,103252622|103306119|103388619|103401420|103401588|103401607|103401671|103401781|103401797|103402025|163312614,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477356,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The diazepine analogues display selective binding to the dopamine D-4 and serotonin S-2A receptors similar to that of clozapine, but none has a dopamine D-4 selectivity (Ki for the dopamine D-2A receptor/Ki for the dopamine D-4 receptor) greater than that of clozapine. All of the oxepin analogues also show substantial binding to the dopamine D-4 and serotonin S-2A receptors with 10-(4-methylpiperazino)dibenz[b,f]oxepin having a dopamine D-4 selectivity greater than that of clozapine. Some of the 5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cycloheptene analogues also show strong binding to both the dopamine D-4 and serotonin S-2A receptors, 5-methyl-10-(4-methylpiperazino)-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene having a dopamine D-4 selectivity of 7.8 as compared to 10 for clozapine but a serotonin S-2A selectivity (Ki for the dopamine D-2 receptor/Ki for the serotonin S-2A receptor) of 2.0 as compared to 28 for clozapine.

However, recent work on D2 knock out mice suggests that haloperidol's EPS may be related to its potent D2 binding (K(i)=0.9 nM). In this study, we explore this question by synthesizing and testing an analogue (DS-27) that binds to D2 receptors with higher affinity than haloperidol, but cannot form quaternary metabolites.

Using clearance and brain penetration studies as a screen, a series of 1,2,3, 4-tetrahydroisoquinolines, exemplified by 13, was identified with high D(3) affinity and selectivity against the D(2) receptor. Following examination of molecular models, the flexible butyl linker present in 13 was replaced by a more conformationally constrained cyclohexylethyl linker, leading to compounds with improved oral bioavailability and selectivity over other receptors.

287,63251,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]spiperone from human Dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Design, synthesis, and evaluation of metabolism-based analogues of haloperidol incapable of forming MPP+-like species._||_Abstract: The long-term, irreversible, Parkinsonism-like side effects of haloperidol have been speculated to involve several mechanisms. More recently, it has been speculated that the metabolic transformation to MPP+-like species may contribute to the Parkinsonism-like side effects. Because BCPP+ and its reduced analogue have been shown to possess the potential to destroy dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatum, we have designed new analogues of haloperidol lacking the structural features necessary to form neurotoxic quaternary species but retaining their dopamine-binding capacity. The most potent agent at the D2 receptor, the homopiperidine analogue 11, was found to be equipotent to haloperidol. It was also of interest to identify analogues with DA binding profiles similar to that of clozapine at the dopamine receptor subtypes. Evaluation of the proposed agents shows that the ratio of D2 to D4 (2) binding of clozapine was mimicked by 7 [K(i)(D2) = 33, K(i)(D3) = 200, K(i)(D4) = 11 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 3] and 9 [K(i)(D2) = 44, K(i)(D3) = 170, K(i)(D4) = 24 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 2]. A preliminary in-vivo testing of compound 7 shows that its behavioral profile is similar to that of clozapine. This profile suggests that there is a need for further evaluation of these two synthetic agents and their enantiomers for efficacy and lack of catalepsy in animal models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672843,20210802,3559|9906978|9975463|11199716|11200115|11257780|11303835|11325428|11338272|11382826|11428871|11474752|135398737,103165765|103167216|103391817|103391818|103391819|103392132|103392133|103392134|103392135|103392137|103392158|103392256|103392257,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14736232,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, recent work on D2 knock out mice suggests that haloperidol's EPS may be related to its potent D2 binding (K(i)=0.9 nM). In this study, we explore this question by synthesizing and testing an analogue (DS-27) that binds to D2 receptors with higher affinity than haloperidol, but cannot form quaternary metabolites.

The affinity and selectivity of these compounds were determined using in vitro receptor binding assays, and their log P values were estimated using HPLC analysis. The effect of various N-substituents on the sigma-1 and sigma-2 dissociation constants was examined. These substituents included fluoroalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, iodopropenyl, and selected ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted benzyl groups. Also determined were the effects of various moieties on the phenoxy ring; specifically 4-iodo, 4-bromo, 4-nitro, 4-cyano, 3-bromo, and pentafluoro substituents were examined. The ranges in the dissociation constants of these compounds for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors were 0.38-24.3 and 3.9-361 nM, respectively. The ratio of Ki (sigma-2/sigma-1) ranged from 1.19 to 121. One of the most promising of the iodinated ligands, 1-(trans-iodopropen-2-yl)-4-[(4-cyanophenoxy)methyl]piperidi ne (4), was labeled with 123I and studied in vivo in adult male rats. High uptake and good retention of radioactivity was observed in the brain and many other organs known to possess sigma receptors.

(R,S)-trans-8- Hydroxy-2-[N-n-propyl-N-(3'-iodo-2'-propenyl)amino]tetralin (trans-8-OH-PIPAT), 8, was synthesized by a 10-step reaction. Binding studies with rat hippocampal membrane homogenates showed that 8 exhibited a Ki value of 0.92 nM against (R,S)-[3H]-8-OH-DPAT. Radiolabeled [125I]-8 was prepared from the corresponding tri-n-butyltin precursor via an oxidative iododestannylation reaction with sodium [125I]iodide.

In the piperazine series, replacing the N-methyl group by a N-phenyl moiety (15-17, 30-32) provided a dramatic decrease of affinity for all receptors (K(i) > 1000 nM).

These three neurotransmitters have been the focus of considerable research because the modulation of their production and their interaction at monoamine receptors has profound effects upon a multitude of pharmacological outcomes. Our interest has focused on neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms in a search for medications for cocaine abuse. Herein we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of an array of 2-aminopentanophenones. This array has yielded selective inhibitors of the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters with little effect upon serotonin trafficking. A subset of compounds had no significant affinity at 5HT1A, 5HT1B, 5HT1C, D1, D2, or D3 receptors. The lead compound, racemic 1-(4-methylphenyl)-2-pyrrolidin-1-yl-pentan-1-one 4a, was resolved into its enantiomers and the S isomer was found to be the most biologically active enantiomer.

Compound 6 [PG01037, (N-(4-(4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)-trans-but-2-enyl)-4-pyridine-2-ylbenzamide)] and related analogues are currently being evaluated in animal models of drug addiction. In these studies, a discrepancy between in vitro binding affinity, in vivo occupancy, and behavioral potency has been observed. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) modifications of the 2-pyridylphenyl moiety of 6 and (2) hydroxyl, acetyl, and cyclopropyl substitutions on the butylamide linking chain systematically coupled with 2-fluorenylamide or 2-pyridylphenylamide and 2-methoxy- or 2,3-dichloro-substituted phenylpiperazines to measure the impact on binding affinity, D2/D3 selectivity, lipophilicity, and function. In general, these modifications were well tolerated at the human dopamine D3 (hD3) receptor (Ki = 1-5 nM) as measured in competition binding assays.

After administration of either radioligand there was moderately high brain uptake of radioactivity. Receptor blocking and displacement experiments showed that a high proportion of this radioactivity was bound specifically to PBR. In monkey and rat, 3 and 10 were rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis and N-debenzylation, respectively, each to a single polar radiometabolite.

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain. These data demonstrate that acute and selective pharmacological blockade of Na(v)1.8 sodium channels in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL928141,20181023,16038374,103558202,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17483457,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

801,350924,Literature-derived,Inhibition of dopamine D2S receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022844,20180910,17758320,103530856,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

(-)-12a and its lower affinity enantiomer ((+)-12a) were labeled with carbon-11 (t1/2 ) 20.4 min) using [11C]cyanide ion as labeling agent and evaluated as PET radioligands in cynomolgus monkeys. After injection of [11C](-)-12a, there was high uptake and retention of radioactivity across brain according to the rank order of CB1 receptor densities.

Further exploration of both N-substituted and aryl ring-substituted analogues resulted in the discovery of several high affinity D2R/D3R ligands with 3-benzofurylmethyl-substituents (e.g., 45, K(i)(D2R/D3R) = 1.7:0.34 nM) that induced high affinity not achieved in similarly N-substituted piperidine analogues and significantly (470-fold) improved D3R binding affinity compared to the parent ligand 1. X-ray crystallographic data revealed a distinctive spatial arrangement of pharmacophoric elements in the piperidinol vs tropine analogues, providing clues for the diversity in SAR at the D2 and D3 receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1033065,20181026,133633|25128757|25129807|25130157|25132869,103247487|194151539|194151541|194172346|194186039,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18774793,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Here we describe a series of new 6-aminomethylbenzofuranones in an effort to find new chemical structures with balanced affinities for 5-HT2 and dopamine receptors. Through biological and computational studies of 5-HT2A and D2 receptors, we identified the receptor serine residues S3.36 and S5.46 as the molecular keys to explaining the differences in affinity and selectivity between these new compounds for this group of receptors. Specifically, the ability of these compounds to establish one or two H-bonds with these key residues appears to explain their difference in affinity. In addition, we describe compound 2 (QF1004B) as a tool to elucidate the role of 5-HT2C receptors in mediating antipsychotic effects and metabolic adverse events. The compound 16a (QF1018B) showed moderate to high affinities for D2 and 5-HT2A receptors, and a 5-HT2A/D2 ratio was predictive of an atypical antipsychotic profile.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1027240,20181026,3559|10022781|10090424|10090486|10338282|25099159|25130505|25130829|25130830|25130831|25130835|25131483|25131829|44569093|135398737,103165765|103167216|103384674|103384675|103414048|103414391|103605771|103605772|103605773|103605841|103605842|103605843|103605844|103605902|103605903,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18783204,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

We considered that [(11)C]3 might itself be a superior radiotracer for imaging brain P-gp function and therefore aimed to prepare [(11)C]3 and characterize its efficacy. An amide precursor (2) was synthesized and methylated with [(11)C]iodomethane to give [(11)C]3. After administration of [(11)C]3 to wild-type mice, brain radioactivity uptake was very low. In P-gp (mdr-1a(-/-)) knockout mice, brain uptake of radioactivity at 30 min increased about 3.5-fold by PET measures, and over 7-fold by ex vivo measures. In knockout mice, brain radioactivity was predominantly (90%) unchanged radiotracer. In monkey PET experiments, brain radioactivity uptake was also very low but after P-gp blockade increased more than 7-fold. [(11)C]3 is an effective new radiotracer for imaging brain P-gp function and, in favor of future successful quantification, appears free of extensive brain-penetrant radiometabolites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1026445,20181026,9805944,103606134,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18783208,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

A review of previous reports indicates that arylalkyl substituents can improve the potency and selectivity of the binding affinity at D(2)-like receptors. In this paper, we explored the contributions of two key pharmacophoric groups, that is, 4'-fluorobutyrophenones and 3-methyl-7-azaindoles, to the potency and selectivity of synthesized agents at D(2)-like receptors.

Interestingly, these compounds generally do not have good binding affinity at the D(1) receptor, but most compounds are potent at both D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors. Compound 8h, containing 1-m-tolyl-benzazepine scaffold and 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine core, displayed good affinity at all tested receptors, with K(i) values of 144, 80, and 133nM, for the D(1), D(2), and 5-HT(1A) receptors, respectively. Compound 13 with the triazole moiety formed differently from that in 8h showed the highest affinity at the D(2) receptor with K(i) value of 19nM. This compound also showed moderate affinity at the 5-HT(1A) (K(i), 105nM), and D(1) (K(i), 551nM) receptors. Functional assays indicated that both compounds 13 and 8h are antagonists at D(1) and D(2) receptors, whereas full agonistic activity at the 5-HT(1A) receptor was observed. In agreement with the binding affinity, compound 13 is a high efficacy D(2) antagonist and 5-HT(1A) agonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1044818,20180911,44537919|44537925,103695229|103695230,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19559623,0,,P14416,,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The structure-activity relationships (SAR) investigation led to the discovery of the nicotinoyl guanidine 22 as a potent FXa inhibitor (FXa IC(50)=4 nM, EC(2xPT)=7 microM). However, the potent CYP3A4 inhibition activity (IC(50)=0.3 microM) of 22 precluded its further development. Detailed analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of compound 22 bound to FXa indicated that the substituent at the 6-position of the nicotinoyl group of 22 would be solvent-exposed, suggesting that efforts to attenuate the unwanted CYP activity could focus at this position without affecting FXa potency significantly. Further SAR studies on the 6-substituted nicotinoyl guanidines resulted in the discovery of 6-(dimethylcarbamoyl) nicotinoyl guanidine 36 (BMS-344577, IC(50)=9 nM, EC(2xPT)=2.5 microM), which was found to be a selective, orally efficacious FXa inhibitor with an excellent in vitro liability profile, favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in animal models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1049602,20180911,44473100,103709158,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19896847,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Structural features for optimal sigma1 receptor affinity and selectivity over the sigma2 receptor were identified. On the basis of its favorable log D value, 13 was selected as a candidate for the development of a sigma1 receptor positron emission tomography radiotracer. [11C]13 showed high uptake in the brain and other sigma receptor-rich organs of a Papio hamadryas baboon. The in vivo evaluation of [11C]13 indicates that this radiotracer is a suitable candidate for imaging the sigma1 receptor in neurodegenerative processes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1219344,20180914,5009938|46914485|46914486|46914487|46914620|46914621|46914771|46914772|46914773|46914774|46914775|46914776|46914777|46914926|46914927|49864027,104241014|104241015|104241016|104241077|104241078|104241079|104241080|104241081|104241145|104241146|104241147|104241148|104241149|104241223|104241224|104241225,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20662542,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nitrile and fluoro substitutions at the indole 5-position gave highest hSERT potency. Preferred cyclopentane ring stereochemistry in both series was cis (1S,3R for 5-CN compound 8a, 1R,3S for 5-F compound 9a). High hSERT binding affinity was observed for 8a and 9a (0.22 and 0.63 nM, respectively). The corresponding trans isomers were 4-9 times less potent. 8a, dosed at 1 and 3 mg/kg po, produced a robust, dose-dependent increase in extracellular serotonin in the frontal cortex of rats, similar to that induced by paroxetine at 5 mg/kg, po.

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets. Altogether lersivirine is a highly potent and selective NNRTI, with excellent efficacy against NNRTI-resistant viruses.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1691870,20180918,16739244,103708524,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20660667,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The rationalization of the structure-activity relationships (SARs) revealed essential features to attain high TDO inhibition and notably a dense H-bond network mainly involving His(55) and Thr(254) residues. Our study led to the identification of a very promising compound (58) displaying good TDO inhibition (K(i) = 5.5 μM), high selectivity, and good oral bioavailability. Indeed, 58 was chosen for preclinical evaluation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1816027,20200629,135743630,134455312,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21726069,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Of the 23 analogues synthesized and tested, 5 displayed very high affinity for σ(1) (K(i) = 0.48-4.05 nM) and high selectivity for σ(1) relative to σ(2) receptors (σ(1)/σ(2) selectivity of >749-fold). Four of the five compounds (14a, 14b, 14c, and 14e) showed very low affinity for VAChT (K(i) > 290 nM), and the fifth compound (14g) showed moderate affinity for VAChT (K(i) = 44.2 nM). The compound [1'-(4-fluorobenzyl)-3'-hydroxy[1,4']bipiperidinyl-4-yl]-(4-fluorophenyl)methanone (14a) displayed very high affinity and selectivity for σ(1) receptor (K(i) = 0.48 nM, σ(1)/σ(2) > 3600). All four of these most promising compounds (14a, 14b, 14c, and 14e) can be radiosynthesized with fluorine-18 or carbon-11, which will allow further evaluation of their properties as PET probes for imaging σ(1) receptor in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1827958,20200629,53391632|53391731,134442370|134450199,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21732626,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Adamantyl hemiaminals 9-15 displayed generally low affinity for both σ(1) (K(i) values= 294-1950 nM) and σ(2) receptors (K(i) values=201-1020 nM), and negligible affinity for 42 other CNS proteins. Deoxygenation of 9-15 to give the corresponding achiral azaadamantanes 23-29 greatly improved affinity for σ(1) (K(i) values=8.3-239 nM) and σ(2) receptors (K(i) values=34-312 nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1826282,20200629,56665109|56672196|56675439|56682093,134442395|134450449|134454026|134461651,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21788137,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is clear that each pharmacophoric group, the butyrophenone, the piperidine and the 4-chlorophenyl moieties contributes to changes in binding to the receptors of interest. This strategy has resulted in the identification of several new agents, compounds 16, 18, 19, 23, 24 and 25, with binding profiles which satisfy our stated criteria for agents to act as potential atypical antipsychotics.

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2168000,20180923,1346|851833|9859120|10354670|10454026|10456166|12461787|15356306|19871273|44203057|53248299|53248300|58358826,103169108|103196922|103356575|103402070|163313965|163324236|163327704|163327705|163327706|163329505|163334553|163334704|163334705,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Clinical utility of nonselective sodium channel blockers is limited due to serious adverse drug effects. Here, we present the optimization, structure-activity relationships, and in vitro and in vivo characterization of a novel series of Na(V)1.7 inhibitors based on the oxoisoindoline core. Extensive studies with focus on optimization of Na(V)1.7 potency, selectivity over Na(V)1.5, and metabolic stability properties produced several interesting oxoisoindoline carboxamides (16A, 26B, 28, 51, 60, and 62) that were further characterized. The oxoisoindoline carboxamides interacted with the local anesthetics binding site. In spite of this, several compounds showed functional selectivity versus Na(V)1.5 of more than 100-fold. This appeared to be a combination of subtype and state-dependent selectivity. Compound 28 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of nerve injury-induced ectopic in an ex vivo DRG preparation from SNL rats. Compounds 16A and 26B demonstrated concentration-dependent efficacy in preclinical behavioral pain models.

Herein we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around a series of mGlu(2) receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). The effects of N-substitution (R(1)) and substitutions on the aryl ring (R(2)) were identified as key areas for SAR exploration (Figure 3). Investigation of the effects of varying substituents in both the isoindolinone (2) and benzisothiazolone (3) series led to compounds with improved in vitro potency and/or efficacy. In addition, several analogues exhibited promising pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.

The structure of compound 1 comprises a hydroxycyclopentenone ring instead of the furanone ring characteristic for phthalides and represents a new carbon arrangement within polyketides. In the epimeric compounds 5a and 5b the phthalide (=isobenzofuranone) nucleus is modified to an isobenzofuran ring with ketal and acetal functionalities. Biosynthetically the structural skeletons of cyclomarinone (1) and maristachones A (2), C (4), D (5a), and E (5b) are most unusual due to the presence of an additional carbon atom when compared to the basic polyketide skeleton.

However, most of these anti-obesity medications have little or no effect on weight loss, and some cases have demonstrated fatal side effects. Due to the urgent need for highly potent and selective anti-obesity agents, the serotonin receptors (5-HTR) have been the focus of much interest as a novel therapeutic target. In this report, we have developed pyrimidoazepine analogs targeting the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and evaluated their biological activity in vitro and in vivo as novel anti-obesity agents. We were able to identify 6p as the most potent 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C ligand in vitro (IC50 = 3 nM and 2.3 nM, respectively), and this compound also demonstrated the greatest potency in vivo. In an acute obesity model, mice treated with 6p showed significant decrease in body weight gain and food intake over approximately 77-94% compared to a control group. In a chronic obesity model, mice treated with 6p also showed a marked decrease in food intake and body weight gain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2396124,20180927,73347435|73348966|73355004|73356562,174491594|174496661|174517283|174522465,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23537943,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Electrophysiological studies of 4-(2'-trifluoromethoxybenzyloxy)benzylammonium chloride (9) using embryonic cortical neurons demonstrated that 9 promoted both fast and slow inactivation of Na(+) channels. These findings suggest that the potent anticonvulsant activities of the earlier compounds were due, in part, to the benzyloxyphenyl motif and provide support for the use of the biaryl-linked pharmacophore in future drug design efforts.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3094849,20180928,23372523|47003377|72736159|72736161|72736163|75414421|76317227|76317228|76320939,194152381|194152382|194159323|194159324|194166328|194166329|194173164|194173165|194186818,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24238903,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
1256,1059882,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to dopamine D2 receptor (unknown origin),Title: Structure-based design of 2-aminopyridine oxazolidinones as potent and selective tankyrase inhibitors._||_Abstract: Aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway has been implicated in the development and formation of many cancers. TNKS inhibition has been shown to antagonize Wnt signaling via Axin stabilization in APC mutant colon cancer cell lines. We employed structure-based design to identify a series of 2-aminopyridine oxazolidinones as potent and selective TNKS inhibitors. These compounds exhibited good enzyme and cell potency as well as selectivity over other PARP isoforms. Co-crystal structures of these 2-aminopyridine oxazolidinones complexed to TNKS reveal an induced-pocket binding mode that does not involve interactions with the nicotinamide binding pocket. Oral dosing of lead compounds 3 and 4 resulted in significant effects on several Wnt-pathway biomarkers in a three day DLD-1 mouse tumor PD model.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3101864,20180928,71660496,194180244,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24900633,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The replacement of the H-7 in the tetrahydronaphthalene system by an amino group resulted in privileged 5-HT(2A) affinity of the 6-fluorobenzo[d]isoxazol derivative 36 and the alcohol 25 both showing a pK(i) value for 5-HT(2A) higher than 8.3 and good binding affinities for D₂ receptor leading to a Meltzer's ratio characteristic of an atypical antipsychotic profile. Additionally, a small collection of 3-aminomethyltetralone derivatives was prepared and examined here for their affinities and selectivities as 5-HT(2A)/D₂ dual ligands. Compound 11 shows the best profile with good pKi values for 5-HT(2A) and D₂ receptors leading to a Meltzer's ratio characteristic of a typical antipsychotic behaviour. These three compounds behaved as competitive antagonists of both 5-HT(2A) and D₂ receptors, and might be promising pharmacological tools for the investigation of the dual function of the 5HT(2A)-D₂ ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3106889,20200620,76317383|76321107|76331989,194152868|194159842|194180517,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24316025,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Thus, selective D4 ligands may be useful in treating some of these conditions. Previous studies in our laboratory have indicated that the piperazine analog of haloperidol exhibits selective and increased affinity to the DAD4 receptor subtype, in comparison to its piperidine analog. This led to further exploration of the piperazine moiety to identify new agents that are selective at the D4 receptor. Compound 27 (KiD4=0.84 nM) was the most potent of the compounds tested. However, it only had moderate selectivity for the D4 receptor. Compound 28 (KiD4=3.9 nM) while not as potent, was more discriminatory for the D4 receptor subtype. In fact, compound 28 has little or no binding affinity to any of the other four DA receptor subtypes. In addition, of the 23 CNS receptors evaluated, only two, 5HT1AR and 5HT2BR, have binding affinity constants better than 100 nM (Ki <100 nM). Compound 28 is a potentially useful D4-selective ligand for probing disease treatments involving the D4 receptor, such as assisting smoking cessation, reversing cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and treating erectile dysfunction.

The SAR uncovered within these two allosteric PLD inhibitor series further highlights the inherent challenges of developing isoform selective PLD inhibitors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3379090,20200625,118722109,312371070,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25466173,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Compounds 5b, 5c, 5d, and 4g, demonstrate high affinity for dopamine D3 receptors and moderate selectivity for the dopamine D3 versus D2 receptor subtypes. To further examine their potential as therapeutic agents, their intrinsic efficacy at both D2 and D3 receptors was determined using a forskolin-dependent adenylyl cyclase inhibition assay. Affinity at dopamine D4 and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors was also determined. In addition, information from previous molecular modeling studies of the binding of a panel of 163 structurally-related benzamide analogues at dopamine D2 and D3 receptors was applied to this series of compounds. The results of the modeling studies were consistent with our previous experimental data. More importantly, the modeling study results explained why the replacement of the amide linkage with the hetero-aromatic ring leads to a reduction in the affinity of these compounds at D3 receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3374187,20181005,11452692|53326601|76441180|118719791|118719792|118719793|118719794|118719795|118719796|118719797|118719798|118719799|118719800|118719801|118719802|118719803|118719804|118719805|118719806|118719807|118719808|118719809|118719810|118719811|118719812,124957645|124976010|312367616|312367617|312367618|312367619|312367620|312367621|312367622|312367623|312367624|312367625|312367626|312367627|312367628|312367629|312367630|312367631|312367632|312367633|312367634|312367635|312367636|312367637|312367638,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25556097,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The vast structural diversity of this group of polyketides is largely introduced by enzymatic oxidations, which can significantly influence the bioactivity profile. Four new compounds, griseorhodins D-F, were isolated from a griseorhodin producer, Streptomyces sp. CN48+, based upon their enhancement of calcium uptake in a mouse dorsal root ganglion primary cell culture assay. Two of these compounds, griseorhodins D1 and D2, were shown to be identical to the major, previously uncharacterized products of a grhM mutant in an earlier griseorhodin biosynthesis study. Their structures enabled the establishment of a more complete hypothesis for the biosynthesis of griseorhodins and related compounds. The other two compounds, griseorhodins E and F, represent new products of post-polyketide synthase tailoring in griseorhodin biosynthesis and showed significant binding activity in a human dopamine active transporter assay.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3363921,20181005,118706244,312346581,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24786728,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

This study tested the hypothesis that further modifications of the tropane analog to produce compounds with less potent binding to the D2 receptor than haloperidol, would produce less catalepsy. These tests have now revealed that while haloperidol produced maximum catalepsy, these compounds produced moderate to low levels of catalepsy. Compound 9, with the least binding affinity to the D2R, produced the least catalepsy and highest Minimum Adverse Effective Dose (MAED) of the analogs tested regardless of their affinities at other receptors including the 5-HT1AR. These observations support the hypothesis that moderation of the D2 binding of the tropane analogs could reduce catalepsy potential in rats and consequently EPS in man.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3366156,20181006,3559|13091268|13091356|13091359|21527771|21533446|57403525|76518514|118709750|118709751|135398745,103167216|103195217|103488767|136922797|136932519|136945472|312351717|312351718|312351719|312351720|312351721,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25070422,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Part II. Second-Generation Analogues with Enhanced Potency, Selectivity, and Pharmacodynamic Modulation in Vivo._||_Abstract: The medicinal chemistry community has directed considerable efforts toward the discovery of selective inhibitors of interleukin-2 inducible T-cell kinase (ITK), given its role in T-cell signaling downstream of the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the implications of this target for inflammatory disorders such as asthma. We have previously disclosed a structure- and property-guided lead optimization effort which resulted in the discovery of a new series of tetrahydroindazole-containing selective ITK inhibitors. Herein we disclose further optimization of this series that resulted in further potency improvements, reduced off-target receptor binding liabilities, and reduced cytotoxicity. Specifically, we have identified a correlation between the basicity of solubilizing elements in the ITK inhibitors and off-target antiproliferative effects, which was exploited to reduce cytotoxicity while maintaining kinase selectivity. Optimized analogues were shown to reduce IL-2 and IL-13 production in vivo following oral or intraperitoneal dosing in mice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3429291,20181006,74983355,242650963,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25844760,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor. Some analogues displayed high affinity for the 5-HT7 receptor, comparable to N-methyllaurotetanine, with moderate selectivity vs 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3584699,20181008,16573,103598424,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25695425,0,,P14416,9606.0,129044.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Several D3R-selective antagonists are effective in animal models of drug abuse, especially in models of relapse. Nevertheless, poor bioavailability, metabolic instability, and/or predicted toxicity have impeded success in translating these drug candidates to clinical use. Herein, we report a series of D3R-selective 4-phenylpiperazines with improved metabolic stability. A subset of these compounds was evaluated for D3R functional efficacy and off-target binding at selected 5-HT receptor subtypes, where significant overlap in SAR with D3R has been observed. Several high affinity D3R antagonists, including compounds 16 (Ki = 0.12 nM) and 32 (Ki = 0.35 nM), showed improved metabolic stability compared to the parent compound, PG648 (6). Notably, 16 and the classic D3R antagonist SB277011A (2) were effective in reducing self-administration of heroin in wild-type but not D3R knockout mice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3599945,20181008,25141534|44309876|86280005|122183764|122183765|122183771|122183778,103266140|124966353|318380417|318380418|318380419|318380425|318380432,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26203768,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The presence of branched allylic substituent groups diminished affinity for the h5HT2A receptor. Likewise, the alkynyl, nitrile and ester derivatives evaluated displayed lower 5-HT2A receptor affinity as compared to 5. Hydrophobic, steric and electronic effects impact the affinity of p-substituted benzyl derivatives 8i-8k but in different ways. High hydrophobicity and size favor 5-HT2A affinity whereas, high electronegativity disfavors 5-HT2A affinity. p-Bromobenzyl analog 8k was identified as a 5-HT2A receptor selective ligand, with the highest 5-HT2A receptor affinity of any aporphine known to date. Most of the other analogs were selective for the 5-HT2A versus the α1A receptor.

Several D3R-selective modulators over the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) can avoid extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinemia. However, few biased D3R ligands were identified or showed a narrow range of selectivity at the D3R over D2R because of their high sequence homology. Herein, we designed, synthesized and evaluated the binding affinity of a series of bitopic ligands: arypiperazine-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazoles.

In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values. At the σ2 receptor, higher affinity was correlated with increasing π. These correlations should aid in the development of more potent and selective drugs within this family of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756490,20200623,24839550|50878551|127026052|127036186|127036932|127036953,174496429|336866908|336883200|336884944|336884983|336885079,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26739781,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

The atypical DAT inhibitors have received attention due to their promising pharmacological profiles in animal models of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse.

We extended SAR by chemically manipulating the oxidation states of the sulfoxide and the amide functional groups, halogenating the phenyl rings, and/or functionalizing the terminal nitrogen with substituted piperazines, resulting in several novel leads such as 11b, which demonstrated high DAT affinity (Ki = 2.5 nM) and selectivity without producing concomitant locomotor stimulation in mice, as compared to cocaine.

The unique pharmacological features of 9j were a high affinity for D2, D3, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A receptors, together with a 20-fold selectivity for the D3 versus D2 subtype, and a low affinity for muscarinic M1 (reducing the risk of anticholinergic side effects), and for hERG channels (reducing incidence of QT interval prolongation). In animal behavioral models, 9j inhibited the locomotor-stimulating effects of phencyclidine, blocked conditioned avoidance response, and improved the cognitive deficit in the novel object recognition tests in rats. 9j exhibited a low potential for catalepsy, consistent with results with risperidone.

In order to study the effects of simplifying the structures of these compounds, a scaffold hopping strategy was used to design several novel sets of substituted isoindolines, tetrahydroisoquinolines and tetrahydro-2-benzazepines. The binding affinities of these new compounds for the sigma 1 (σ1R) and sigma 2 (σ2R) receptors were determined, and some analogs were identified that exhibit high affinity (Ki ≤ 25 nM) and significant selectivity (>10-fold) for σ1R or σ2R. The preferred binding modes of selected compounds for the σ1R are predicted by modeling studies, and the nature of substituents on the aromatic ring and the nitrogen atom of the bicyclic skeleton appears to affect the preferred binding orientation of σ1R-preferring ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4153411,20200618,132060720|132060733|132060734|132060743|132060746|132060752|132060763|132060770|132060776|132060812|132075278,404653221|404656024|404656499|404656632|404658729|404660063|404662671|404665338|404665926|404684558|404686633,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29656199,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The combination of structural elements (heterocyclic nucleus, alkyl chain and 4-substituted piperazine), known to play critical roles in affinity for serotoninergic receptors, and the proper selection of substituents led to compounds with high specificity and affinity towards serotoninergic receptors. In binding studies, several molecules showed high affinity in nanomolar and subnanomolar range at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and moderate or no affinity for other relevant receptors (D1, D2, α1 and α2). N-(2-(4-(pyrimidin-2-yl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)picolinamide (3o) with Ki=0.046nM, was the most affine and selective derivative for the 5-HT1A receptor compared to other serotoninergic dopaminergic and adrenergic receptors. N-(2-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)picolinamide (3b), instead, showed a subnanomolar affinity towards 5-HT2A with Ki=0.0224nM, whereas N-(2-(4-(bis(4-fluorophenyl)methyl)piperazin-1-yl)ethyl)picolinamide (3s) presented an attractive 5-HT2C affinity with Ki=0.8nM. Moreover, the compounds having better affinity and selectivity binding profiles towards 5-HT2A were selected and tested on rat ileum, to determine their effect on 5HT induced contractions.

Preclinical data link the 5-HT7R to a variety of central nervous system processes including the regulation of circadian rhythms, mood, cognition, pain processing, and mechanisms of addiction. 5-HT7R blockade has antidepressant effects and may ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. 5-HT7R has been recently shown to modulate neuronal morphology, excitability, and plasticity, thus contributing to shape brain networks during development and to remodel neuronal wiring in the mature brain. Therefore, the activation of 5-HT7R has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal neuronal connectivity. This Perspective celebrates the silver jubilee of the discovery of 5-HT7R by providing a survey of recent studies on the medicinal chemistry of 5-HT7R ligands and on the neuropharmacology of 5-HT7R.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4199279,20200618,132525569|132525570,404676945|404695019,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767995,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In particular, incorporation of a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine heterocyclic appendage led to a series of high-affinity dopamine receptor partial agonists. Comprehensive pharmacological characterization involving BRET biosensors, binding studies, electrophysiology, and complementation-based assays revealed compounds favoring activation of G proteins (preferably Go) over β-arrestin recruitment at dopamine D2 receptors. The feasibility to design G protein-biased partial agonists as putative novel therapeutics was demonstrated for the representative 2-methoxyphenylpiperazine 16c, which unequivocally displayed antipsychotic activity in vivo. Moreover, combination of the pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine appendage with a 5-hydroxy-N-propyl-2-aminotetraline unit led to balanced or G protein-biased dopaminergic ligands depending on the stereochemistry of the headgroup, illustrating the complex structure-functional selectivity relationships at dopamine D2 receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4010163,20200620,60795|137633705|137636351|137636460|137640391|137642380|137643951|137644966|137655735,103307946|381839991|381843977|381844146|381850019|381852964|381855275|381856760|381872727,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28248104,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,1,1,1,1,0,0

However, since the discovery of its therapeutic potential, no ligand has been successfully developed enough to be tested in the clinic. In the present paper, we report for the first time the medicinal chemistry efforts conducted around the pharmacological tool (-)-PHCCC. This work led to the identification of compound 40, a potent and selective mGluR4 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) with good water solubility and demonstrating consistent activity across validated preclinical rodent models of PD motor symptoms after intraperitoneal administration: haloperidol-induced catalepsy in mouse and the rat 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesion model. Moreover, we also describe the identification of compound 60 a close analogue of compound 40 with improved pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration.

In contrast, literature examples of arylpiperazines 4 and 5 were reported to be pan opioid receptor antagonists, while 6 was a MOR agonist. Two compounds (13l and 11b) showed analgesic response in tail flick test which was blocked by pretreatment with norbinaltorphimine (norBNI).

Considering their modest effectiveness in dementia patients, the increased risk of adverse events and cognitive decline, there is an unmet need for well-tolerated and effective therapy of BPSD. We designed and synthesized multifunctional ligands characterized in vitro as high-affinity partial agonists of D2R, antagonists of 5-HT6R, and blockers of SERT. Moreover, the molecules activated 5-HT1AR and blocked 5-HT7R while having no relevant affinity for off-target M1R and hERG channel. Compound 16 (N-{2-[4-(5-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl)-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridin-1-yl]ethyl}-3-methylbenzene-1-sulfonamide) exhibited a broad antipsychotic-, antidepressant-, and anxiolytic-like activity, not eliciting motor impairments in mice.

Biased allosteric modulators can be designed with high subtype selectivity and defined receptor signaling endpoints, however, selecting the most meaningful parameters for optimization can be perplexing. Historically, 'potency hunting' at the expense of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic optimization has led to numerous tool compounds with excellent pharmacological properties but no path to drug development. Conversely, extensive physicochemical and pharmacokinetic screening with only post hoc bias and allosteric characterization has led to inefficacious compounds or compounds with on-target toxicities.

The intent of this digest is to summarize current understanding and debates within the field.

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite. Herein we describe the discovery of second-generation HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 with increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile achieved by reduction of phase 2 metabolism. Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, the clinical pharmacokinetics for PT2977 supports the hypothesis that attenuating the rate of glucuronidation would improve exposure and reduce variability in patients.

To discover new and potential D1/D2 ligands, 17 derivatives of tetrahydroprotoberberine (THPB) with various substituents were prepared by chemical synthesis or microbial transformation using Streptomyces griseus ATCC 13273. Their functional activities on D1 and D2 receptors were determined by cAMP assay and calcium flux assay. Seven compounds showed high activity on D1/D2 receptor with low IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 1 µM. Especially, top compound 5 showed strong antagonistic activity on both D1 and D2 receptor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.391 and 0.0757 µM, respectively. Five compounds displayed selective antagonistic activity on D1 and D2 receptor. The SAR studies revealed that (1) the hydroxyl group at C-9 position plays an important role in keeping a good activity and small or fewer substituents on ring D of THPBs may also stimulate their effects, (2) the absence of substituents at C-9 position tends to be more selective for D2 receptor, and (3) hydroxyl substitution at C-2 position and the substitution at C-9 position may facilitate the conversion of D1 receptor from antagonist to agonist. Molecular docking simulations found that Asp 103/Asp 114, Ser 107/Cys 118, and Trp 285/ Trp 386 of D1/ D2 receptors are the key residues, which have strong interactions with the active D1/D2 compounds and may influence their functional profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4339971,20210302,72301|453215|3036864|9549058|12269810|14021682|15061351|24837531|71508866|71716758|71717958|90899701|155510939|155522744|155538443|155552483|155555298|155561845|155567118,103168087|103579214|164130981|164136605|164136606|164136608|164142204|164145007|440110427|440114126|440128481|440152426|440162127|440163997|440167013|440186842|440194038|440210465|440223814,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30981605,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Misuse of prescription and illegal opioids (e.g., morphine, heroin) has led to major problems with addiction and overdose. We used vincamine, an indole alkaloid, as a synthetic starting point for dramatic structural alterations of its complex, fused ring system to synthesize 80 diverse compounds with intricate molecular architectures. A select series of vincamine-derived compounds were screened for both agonistic and antagonistic activities against a panel of 168 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug targets. Although vincamine was without an effect, the novel compound 4 (V2a) demonstrated antagonistic activities against hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2. When advanced to animal studies, 4 (V2a) significantly prevented acute morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and stress-induced reinstatement of extinguished morphine-CPP in mouse models of opioid reward and relapse. These results demonstrate that the ring distortion of vincamine offers a promising way to explore new chemical space of relevance to opioid addiction.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4344218,20210302,8969|15376|153284501|153284511|153284538|153284543|155541143|155544367|155557362,103177857|103763450|440127932|440158554|440166524|440167986|440188842|440199078|440229557,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31913038,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Starting from 1a, a high-throughput screening hit, the spiroindoline derivative 40c (RK-287107) was discovered as a potent TNKS/TNKS2 inhibitor with >7000-fold selectivity against the PARP1 enzyme, which inhibits WNT-responsive TCF reporter activity and proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell line COLO-320DM. RK-287107 also demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a mouse xenograft model. These observations suggest that RK-287107 is a promising lead compound for the development of novel tankyrase inhibitors as anticancer agents.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4388187,20210302,137701512,440124627,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30883102,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the most common CNS disease is depression. Considering that in the treatment and the genesis of depression, the most important are the serotonin receptors from 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 groups, and dopamine D2R this article describes searching for group of new ligands for mentioned receptors. In the searching for potentially useful compound, we decided to start from the structure of well-known Fananserin. We tried to developed new derivatives, with changed profile of activity compared to Fananserin. Literature analysis and virtual screening emerged group of halogenated long-chain arylpiperazines derivatives of 1,8 naphthosultam/lactam with hexyl carbon chain to synthesis. The compounds obtaining method was developed with a microwave assisted synthesis. Reactions were carried out in acetonitrile, water or in solvent-free conditions. The obtained compounds were tested for their affinity for the serotonin receptors mentioned above. The work managed to obtain compounds acting on selected serotonin receptors, including multifunctional 5-HT1A/5-HT7/D2 ligand 5k, dual 5-HT1A/D2 ligand 5j and selective 5-HT1A ligands 5r and 5c. The SAR analysis showed a visible dependence of affinity for the 5-HT6 receptors from structure of ligands. This relationship was discussed using molecular docking methods. A conformal analysis was also performed for selected ligands and the Fukui indexes were calculated using the DFT (B3LYP/6-311+G (d,p) level of theory) methods. The conducted research and analysis using molecular docking methods allows for selecting further pathways of structural modifications in the design of new ligands for serotonin receptors belonging to the group mentioned.

The H3R is considered as a drug target for the treatment of several central nervous system disorders. We have synthesized and identified a novel series of 4-aryl-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolinamines that act as selective H3R antagonists. Among all the synthesized compounds, in vitro and docking studies suggested that the 4-methoxy-phenyl-substituted tetrahydroquinazolinamine compound 4c has potent and selective H3R antagonist activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 0.04 μM). Compound 4c did not exhibit any activity on the hERG ion channel and pan-assay interference compounds liability. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 4c crosses the blood brain barrier, and in vivo studies demonstrated that 4c induces anorexia and weight loss in obese, but not in lean mice. These data reveal the therapeutic potential of 4c as an anti-obesity candidate drug via antagonizing the H3R.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4394811,20210302,155522219,440127640,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30998358,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396164,20210302,155565189,440218835,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Compared to piperazine congener 31, which retains a high-affinity orthosteric fragment (5d, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 23.9 nM), 1 was found to be more selective for the D<sub>3</sub>R among D<sub>1</sub>- and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors and exhibited negligible off-target interactions at serotoninergic and adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), common off-target sites for piperazine-containing D<sub>3</sub>R scaffolds. This study provides a unique rationale for implementing weakly potent orthosteric fragments into D<sub>3</sub>R ligand systems to minimize drug promiscuity at other aminergic GPCR sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4397425,20210302,137646281,381858709,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31021617,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The 76 crystallographic hits were sorted into similar groups, with the 3-cyano-quinoline 1a (FP IC<sub>50</sub> = 220,000 nM, LE = 0.43) being a potent member of the 6,6-fused heterocyclic cluster. Employing SAR insights gained from structural comparisons of other H-PGDS fragment binding mode clusters, the initial hit 1a was converted into the 70-fold more potent quinoline 1d (IC<sub>50</sub> = 3,100 nM, LE = 0.49). A systematic substitution of the amine moiety of 1d, utilizing structural information and array chemistry, with modifications to improve inhibitor stability, resulted in the identification of the 300-fold more active H-PGDS inhibitor tool compound 1bv (IC<sub>50</sub> = 9.9 nM, LE = 0.42). This selective inhibitor exhibited good murine pharmacokinetics, dose-dependently attenuated PGD<sub>2</sub> production in a mast cell degranulation assay and should be suitable to further explore H-PGDS biology.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4402263,20210302,129247606,440148932,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30858025,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In this frame, following our interest in the development of molecules able to modulate either the endocannabinoid or the dopaminergic system, and given the multiple and reciprocal interconnections between them, we decided to merge the pharmacophoric elements of some of our early leads for identifying new molecules as tools able to modulate both systems. We herein describe the synthesis and biological characterization of compounds 5a-j inspired by the structure of our potent and selective fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors (3a-c) and ligands of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes (4a,b). Notably, the majority of the new molecules showed a nanomolar potency of interaction with the targets of interest. The drug-likeliness of the developed compounds (5a-j) was investigated in silico while hERG affinity, selectivity profile (for some proteins of the endocannabinoid system), cytotoxicity profiles (on fibroblast and astrocytes), and mutagenicity (Ames test) were experimentally determined. Metabolic studies also served to complement the preliminary drug-likeliness profiling for compounds 3a and 5c. Interestingly, after assessing the lack of toxicity for the neuroblastoma cell line (IMR 32), we demonstrated a potential anti-inflammatory profile for 3a and 5c in the same cell line.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4409079,20210302,1383884|155518672|155520675|155535169|155536374|155540919|155541938|155542534|155550192|155555589|155560181,103455066|440122063|440125288|440147407|440149276|440158009|440160477|440161941|440181107|440194824|440206255,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31518969,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Both drugs are dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonists, with contrasting kinetic profiles. Haloperidol displays fast association/slow dissociation at the D2R, whereas clozapine exhibits relatively slow association/fast dissociation. Recently, we have provided evidence that slow dissociation from the D2R predicts hyperprolactinemia, whereas fast association predicts EPS. Unfortunately, clozapine can cause severe side effects independent of its D2R action. Our results suggest an optimal kinetic profile for D2R antagonist APDs that avoids EPS. To begin exploring this hypothesis, we conducted a structure-kinetic relationship study of haloperidol and revealed that subtle structural modifications dramatically change binding kinetic rate constants, affording compounds with a clozapine-like kinetic profile. Thus, optimization of these kinetic parameters may allow development of novel APDs based on the haloperidol scaffold with improved side-effect profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4416278,20210302,3559|4249|18367|119265|171187|173712|4466165|9977907|11382826|11486446|11696150|13277350|13869644|13932579|14151052|18427972|21390740|21527771|21533446|21559989|23424166|23731422|44395741|45006130|46228604|57403525|68568959|71315272|91379597|154395193|155511820|155514868|155523337|155529543|155531162|155534225|155535732|155535761|155536040|155536713|155537861|155540715|155541844|155544891|155545179|155548481|155554001|155560484|155562484|155566238|155567742,103167216|103238905|103244131|103278445|103306130|103392257|103401724|103454099|103472286|103623877|136922797|136932519|136945472|160697965|312467746|440111722|440112083|440116324|440120131|440122223|440126347|440127145|440129416|440131013|440137969|440138892|440141316|440144484|440145922|440148299|440148355|440148767|440149822|440151531|440151915|440154614|440157572|440160279|440167847|440168597|440176892|440181131|440188160|440190740|440198301|440206962|440212151|440219098|440221572|440225440|440234138,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31580666,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

A preponderance of preclinical data and clinical observations established p38αMAPK as a brain drug discovery target involved in neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction in multiple degenerative and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. We summarize the discovery of highly selective, brain-penetrant, small molecule p38αMAPK inhibitors that are efficacious in diverse animal models of neurologic disorders. A crystallography and pharmacoinformatic approach to fragment expansion enabled the discovery of an efficacious hit. The addition of secondary pharmacology screens to refinement delivered lead compounds with improved selectivity, appropriate pharmacodynamics, and efficacy. Safety considerations and additional secondary pharmacology screens drove optimization that delivered the drug candidate MW01-18-150SRM (MW150), currently in early stage clinical trials.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4602883,20210802,86270361,404668180,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30978288,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, some patients lack an initial response to therapy (i.e., are refractory), and although the mean survival of MM patients has more than doubled in recent years, most patients will eventually relapse. To address this need, we explored the potential of novel cereblon E3 ligase modulators (CELMoDs) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We found that optimization beyond potency of degradation, including degradation efficiency and kinetics, could provide efficacy in a lenalidomide-resistant setting. Guided by both phenotypic and protein degradation data, we describe a series of CELMoDs for the treatment of RRMM, culminating in the discovery of CC-92480, a novel protein degrader and the first CELMoD to enter clinical development that was specifically designed for efficient and rapid protein degradation kinetics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4628562,20210802,53353229|53353320|53353322|53353412|53353508|58389169|67332604|67334013|67334108|137379028|156012104|156013689|156014087|156015744|156016966|156017979|156018963|156021644,442049986|442049991|442052214|442052769|442054644|442055243|442055898|442056854|442056993|442057201|442058413|442058688|442059797|442060157|442060438|442060839|442061937|442063646,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32130004,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

2079,485344,Screening,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Primary Screen for Antagonists,"NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831-01_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley_||_Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

2082,485359,Summary,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Antagonists Summary,"NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831-01_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley_||_Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present project is looking for compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line, which act through an allosteric site.",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2302,20101005,,,1813,,NP_000786,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

2087,624461,Other,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Hit Validation in Radioligand Assay,"Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

2088,624463,Other,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Antagonists,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR). This assay seeks to identify antagonists against the D2 DAR._||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network [MLPCN]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_Grant: NS0676421_||_PI Name: David

2091,624469,Summary,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Antagonist Summary,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR). This assay seeks to identify antagonists against the D2 DAR._||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network [MLPCN]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_Grant: NS0676421_||_PI Name: David Sibley, National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),D2BAAn000,20120808,,,1813,,NP_000786,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1
2094,624494,Other,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: SAR in D2 Binding Assay,"Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line. This assay measures activity of the leads in the D2 radioligand binding assay._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS0676421_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2703,20120817,57377246,136882616,1813,,NP_000786,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

The present project is looking for compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line, which act through an allosteric site._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2700,20120817,133633|16007752|16007814|16007816|16007818|16007820|16007841|17171662|20861039|20861041|57377245|57377246|57377247|57377248|57377249|57383397|57383398|57383399|57383400|57383401|57383402|57383403|57383404|57383405|57383406|57383407|57383408|57383409|57383410|57383411|57383412|57383413|57383414|57383415|57383416|57383417|57383418|57383419|57383420|57383421|57383422|57383423|57383424|57383425|57383426|57383427|57383428|57383429|57383430|57383431|57383432|57383434|57383435|57383436|57383437,124880521|136882616|136882617|136882618|136882619|136882620|136889446|136889447|136889448|136889449|136889450|136889451|136889452|136889453|136889454|136889455|136889456|136889458|136889459|136889460|136889461|136889462|136889463|136889464|136889465|136889466|136889467|136889468|136889469|136889470|136889471|136889472|136889473|136889474|136889475|136889476|136889477|136889478|136889479|136889480|136889481|136889482|136889483|136889484|136889485|136889486|136889487|136889488|136889489|136889491|136889492|136889493|136889494|136889495|136889496,1813,,NP_000786,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,1,1
