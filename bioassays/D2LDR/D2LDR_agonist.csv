Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives._||_Abstract: The conformationally restricted linear tricyclic analogs of 5- and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralins were investigated for their serotonergic and dopaminergic properties. These cis and trans analogs of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole (3), where a five-membered ring is fused between the nitrogen and C-3 carbon of 2-aminotetralin, were synthesized from 5-methoxy- and 8-methoxytetralones. The enantiomers of trans-5-methoxy-N-n-propyl and -N-allyl analogs were obtained via fractional recrystallization of their di-p-toluoyl-L (or D) tartaric acid salts. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests. In the 5-substituted series (R1 in 3), the trans isomers were found to possess higher levels of pharmacological activity then the corresponding cis isomers. The trans-5-methoxy analogs showed selective 5-HT1A receptor activity in vitro but displayed mixed 5-HT1A and D2 agonist properties in vivo. The corresponding trans-5-hydroxy analogs were found to be potent D2 agonists with full intrinsic activity. An examination of nitrogen substitution (R2 in 3) revealed that analogs with either an allyl or an n-propyl group displayed equipotent activities. Substitution with a cyclopropylmethyl or benzyl group resulted in reduced activity. Among the resolved analogs tested, the activity was found to reside exclusively in the (3aS)-(-)-enantiomers. In the 8-substituted series (R1 in 3), only 8-methoxy-N-allyl analogs were synthesized and evaluated. In this case, both cis and trans isomers showed equally weak in vitro 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity devoid of dopaminergic effects. The presence of an additional methyl group at the C-2 position (R3 in 3) of the cis-(+/-)-8-methoxy-N-n-propyl analog resulted in enhancement of in vitro 5-HT1A receptor binding affinity, with the (2 beta,3a alpha,9a alpha)-(+/-)-isomer displaying potency 35 times greater than the (2 alpha,3a alpha,9a alpha)-(+/-)-isomer.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL659149,20181014,10014057|10036887|10105311|10355219|10377224|10398936|10444473|11776081,103171762|103171763|103171823|103171824|103171858|103171864|103171983|103171989,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097538,0,,P14416,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Study of the physicochemical influence of the pharmacophore on 5-HT(1a)/alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor affinity: synthesis of a new derivative with mixed 5-HT(1a)/d(2) antagonist properties._||_Abstract: In this paper we have designed and synthesized a test series of 32 amide arylpiperazine derivatives VI in order to gain insight into the physicochemical influence of the pharmacophores of 5-HT(1A) and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. The training set was designed applying a fractional factorial design using six physicochemical descriptors. The amide moiety is a bicyclohydantoin or a diketopiperazine (X = -(CH(2))(3)-, -(CH(2))(4)-; m = 0, 1), the spacer length is 3 or 4 methylene units, which are the optimum values for both receptors, and the aromatic substituent R occupies the ortho- or meta-position and has been selected from a database of 387 substituents using the EDISFAR program. The 5-HT(1A) and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor binding affinities of synthesized compounds VI (1-32) have been determined. This data set has been used to derive classical quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and neural networks models for both receptors (following paper). A comparison of these models gives information for the design of the new ligand EF-7412 (46) (5-HT(1A): K(i) = 27 nM; alpha(1): K(i) > 1000 nM). This derivative displays affinity for the dopamine D(2) receptor (K(i) = 22 nM) and is selective versus all other receptors examined (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(4) and Bz; K(i) > 1000 nM). EF-7412 (46) acts as an antagonist in vivo in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor sites and as an antagonist in the dopamine D(2) receptor. Thus, EF-7412 (46) is a derivative with mixed 5-HT(1A)/D(2) antagonist properties and this derivative could be useful as a pharmacological tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL664619,20181017,52941718,104236689,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11170628,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The addition of various nucleophiles to (R)-lambda1,11-carbonylaporphine [(R)-11] or to the 1,11-hydroxymethyleneaporphine epimers gave separable mixtures of epimers. The epimeric ratios obtained in most reactions seem to be a result of steric factors directing the nucleophilic attack. The structure of the epimers was determined by a combination of X-ray crystallography (5 derivatives), NMR spectroscopy, and chemical correlation. Interesting and diverse pharmacological profiles of the derivatives were revealed through binding studies at serotonin 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(1A) receptors as well as at dopamine D(2A) receptors. Two derivatives appeared to be selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists. It is evident from our results that the novel ring system [(R)-4] provides a useful complement to other scaffolds available to medicinal chemists involved in studies of GPC receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL664743,20181017,6005|122187|6603866|10421583|10562462|10610641|10706553|10825325,103167211|103190155|103194823|103196284|103197777|103198084|103198227|103198294,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10753471,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Structural modifications of N- and C-linked (principally hydantoin) analogues at the 5-position were synthesized and their pharmacological activities were utilized to deduce significant steric and electrostatic requirements of the 5-HT1D and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes. Conformations of the active molecules were computed which, when overlaid, suggested a pharmacophore hypothesis which was consistent with the affinity and selectivity measured at 5-HT1D and 5-HT2A receptors. This pharmacophore is composed of a protonated amine site, an aromatic site, a hydrophobic pocket, and two hydrogen-bonding sites. A 'selectivity site' was also identified which, if occupied, induced sensitivity for 5-HT1D over 5-HT2A in this series of molecules. The development and use of the pharmacophore models in compound design is described. In addition, the physicochemical constraints of molecular size and hydrophobicity required for efficient oral absorption are discussed. Utilizing the pharmacophore model in conjunction with the physicochemical constraints of molecular size and log DpH7.4 led to the discovery of 311C90 (6), a new selective 5-HT1D agonist with good oral absorption and potential use in the treatment of migraine.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL669948,20200703,60857,103346351,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7658443,0,,P14416,9986.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model. The present study contributes to the SAR of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines, and the 2-TfO analogues of 11-piperazinyldibenzazepines are promising candidates as clozapine-like atypical antipsychotics with low propensity to induce EPS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL884444,20181016,3964|10596380,103218455|103270080,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10377229,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

61474,Literature-derived,Percent of Dopamine receptor D2 in low affinity state for the compound in presence of Gpp(NH)p (pretreatment with 100 nM of compound).,"Title: Design, synthesis, and dopamine receptor modulating activity of spiro bicyclic peptidomimetics of L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide._||_Abstract: In the present study, the synthesis of the 5.5.6. and 5.6.5. spiro bicyclic lactam PLG peptidomimetics, compounds 3 and 4, respectively, was undertaken. These peptidomimetics were designed to examine the following: (1) the effect that changing the size of the thiazolidine and lactam ring systems would have on the ability of these systems to mimic the type-II beta-turn and (2) the effect that these structural perturbations would have on the ability of the peptidomimetics to modulate dopamine receptors. Through the use of the [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) dopamine D2 receptor competitive binding assay, 3 and 4, at a concentration of 100 nM, decreased the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor for the agonist. These effects were observed when either Gpp(NH)p was absent or present and they were comparable to those produced by PLG at a concentration of 1 microM. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 also increased the percentage of D2 receptors that existed in the high-affinity state. Even with Gpp(NH)p present, 3 and 4 were able to return the RH/RL ratios to values observed in the respective controls where Gpp(NH)p was absent. Furthermore, both peptidomimetics were able to attenuate the Gpp(NH)p-induced shift to the low-affinity state to a greater extent than PLG. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 were evaluated in vivo as modulators of apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of hemiparkinsonism, and each affected the rotational behavior in a bell-shaped dose-response relationship producing increases of 95 +/- 31% (0.01 mg/kg, ip) and 88 +/- 14% (0.001 mg/kg, ip), respectively.

Optimization of in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo activity in rodent models of psychosis has led to compound 24, which showed good affinities for human D(2), D(3), and 5-HT(1A) receptors but significantly less affinity for human alpha(1) adrenoceptors and rat H(1) and muscarinic receptors. In rodents, 24 showed functional D(2)-like antagonism and 5-HT(1A) partial agonism. After oral dosing, 24 showed good activity in rodent antipsychotic tests and very little potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), as measured by its ability to induce catalepsy in rats only at very high doses.

Compound 15 (DuP 734) is a combined antagonist of sigma-1 and serotonin 5HT2 receptors, which has been entered into phase I clinical trials as a potential antipsychotic drug. Tetralins 1 and 2 were prepared to determine whether restriction of the conformation of 15 and its analogs may lead to differences in binding selectivity or in vivo profile. The syntheses and the structure-activity relationships of these compounds are reported herein. A reduced derivative, 14, had high affinity for sigma-1 and serotonin 5HT2 receptors as well as excellent oral activity in some animal antipsychotic models.

The structure-activity relationships surrounding this compound were studied by synthesis of analogues and evaluation of their dopaminergic activity. The cyclohexene substitution pattern was varied along with the length of the chain connecting the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine to the cyclohexene. Compound 14, having the 1,3-substitution pattern and a single methylene chain, was the most potent. The 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine could be replaced by other aryl-cyclic amines with a slight loss in activity. The phenyl group on the cyclohexene ring could be para substituted; electron-donating groups were better tolerated than electron-withdrawing groups. Finally, the enantiomers of 14 were resolved via the 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate salts. Although both isomers were partial DA agonists, the (+)-enantiomer had higher intrinsic activity than the (-)-enantiomer. Syntheses were developed that allowed rapid preparation of analogues. An X-ray crystal structure determination of an intermediate identified the (+)-isomer of 14 as having R configuration. This compound, designated CI-1007 (PD 143188), was found to have antipsychotic-like activity in behavioral tests; in particular, it was orally active in the conditioned avoidance test in squirrel monkeys with an ED50 of 0.6 mg/kg.

The four rigid analogs where compared for their ability to bind to the DA D2 receptor and to inhibit forskolin-stimulated cAMP formation, a measure of DA agonist activity. Of the four rigid analogs of compound 11, only compound 12b had significant activity in both assays. Molecular modeling studies of 12a-d showed each had a single conformation with regard to the distance between the benzamide aryl-centroid and the 4-nitrogen atom of the pyridylpiperazine. Compound 12b was shown to have a greater distance between these functionalities (11.8 A) as compared to the other isomers (9.8-10.4 A). The distance between these two functionalities in 12b was similar to that of a conformer of 11 which has an extended conformation.

Target compounds were studied for their ability to bind to the DA D2 receptor in vitro and to inhibit dopamine synthesis and spontaneous locomotor activity in rats. Effects of tether length and relative stereochemistry were assessed for a series of 2-pyridylpiperazines. The cyclohexylethyl spacer was found to be the most active in the series. Further studies explored effects of changes in the arylpiperazine and indole portions of the molecule. From these studies trans-2-[[4-(1H-3-indolyl)cyclohexyl]ethyl]-4- (2-pyridinyl)piperazine (30a) was selected for further evaluation. It was characterized as a partial agonist of DA D2 receptors in vitro and caused decreases in dopamine synthesis and release as well as dopamine neuronal firing. Compound 30a was shown to be devoid of behavioral effects associated with postsynaptic DA D2 receptor activation. Furthermore, compound 30a was shown both to decrease DA synthesis and to inhibit Sidman avoidance responding in squirrel monkeys.

By investigation of the optimal position for the basic nitrogen in a series of 2-phenyl-3-piperidylindoles, it was found that with the basic nitrogen at the 3-position of the piperidine it was not necessary to further substitute the piperidine in order to obtain good binding at h5-HT(2A) receptors. This meant the compounds no longer had high affinity at the IKr potassium channel, an issue with previous series of 2-aryl-3-(4-piperidyl)indoles. Improvements could be made to oral bioavailability in this series by reduction of the pK(a) of the basic nitrogen, by adding a fluorine atom to the piperidine ring, leading to 3-(4-fluoropiperidin-3-yl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole (17). Metabolic studies with this compound identified oxidation at the 6-position of the indole as a major route in vitro and in vivo in rats.

Optimization studies were carried out on 8 with the aim of achieving 1000-fold selectivity for hD(4) over all other receptors while retaining the good pharmacokinetic properties of the lead. After initial preparation of 8 as a minor component in a low-yielding reaction, a novel and regioselective 'four-step/one-pot' procedure was developed which proved to be applicable to rapid investigation of the SAR of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one ring. Various changes to substituents attached to the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one core of 8 did not significantly improve selectivity for hD(4) over hD(2) and hD(3). Greater selectivity (>1000-fold) was ultimately achieved by meta substitution of the benzyl group of 8 with various substituents.

In a mitogenesis functional assay, the effect of the test compounds on cellular uptake of [3H]thymidine in D4-transfected CHO 10,001 cells was measured and compared to the response of the full dopamine agonist quinpirole. The activity of the compounds varied from full antagonist to weak partial agonist activity (intrinsic activity of 0-19% in comparison to quinpirole).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671378,20181015,3559|9948461|9948965|10315310|10447709|10450892|10494394|10498972|10518406|10542345|10548105|10588194|10589218|10590285|10615787|10636896|10638052|10660814|10684706|10708280|10732925|10733406|10734727|10758004|10780510|10780942|10782049|10805355|135398737,103165765|103167216|103189602|103363609|103363611|103363638|103363808|103363828|103363829|103363830|103363891|103363893|103363899|103363918|103363921|103363922|103363949|103364010|103364038|103364039|103364100|103364101|103364142|103364237|103364476|103364506|103364507|103364550|103364591,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9406594,0,,P14416,,198.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Additionally, it was discovered that a group such as 3-(3-methoxybenzyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl in the 2-position of the indole ring (43) can replace the arylsulfonyl substituent in the 1-position with no loss of affinity. This suggested that the binding conformation of the aminoethyl side chain at this receptor was toward the 4-position of the indole ring and was supported by the fact that the 4-(aminoethyl)indoles (45) also displayed high affinity, as did the conformationally rigid 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[c,d]indole (49). Molecular modeling showed that 19, 43, and 45 all had low-energy conformers that overlaid well onto 49. Both 19 and 49 had good selectivity over other serotonin receptors tested, with 49 also showing excellent selectivity over all dopamine receptors. In a functional adenylate cyclase stimulation assay, 19 and 49 had no agonist activity, whereas 45 behaved as a partial agonist. Finally, it was shown that 19 had good activity in the 5-HT(2A) centrally mediated mescaline-induced head twitch assay, which implies that it is brain-penetrant.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671380,20181017,6918542|6918601|9796627|9817810|9862256|9867475|9927441|11747350,103272941|103307795|103307845|103308762|103359034|103359133|103359157|103359196,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11689074,0,,P14416,,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation.

However, definitive behavioral investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly selective D3 agonists and antagonists. In an attempt to design a novel class of D3 ligands with which to study this receptor system, a series of chemically divergent compounds that possessed various structural features that exist within several classes of reputed D3 agents was screened and compared to the recently reported NGB 2904 (58b). On the basis of these results, a novel series of compounds was designed that included functional moieties that were required for high-affinity and selective binding to D3 receptors. All the compounds in this series included an aryl-substituted piperazine ring, a varying alkyl chain linker (C3-C5), and a terminal aryl amide. The compounds were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for binding in CHO cells transfected with human D2, D3, or D4 receptor cDNAs. D3 binding affinities ranged from K(i) = 1.4 to 1460 nM. The most potent analogue in this series, 51, demonstrated a D3/D2 selectivity of 64 and a D3/D4 selectivity of 1300. Structure-activity relationships for this class of ligands at D3 receptors will provide new leads toward the development of highly selective and potent molecular probes that will prove useful in the elucidation of the role D3 receptors play in the psychomotor stimulant and reinforcing properties of cocaine.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671385,20181017,1687|10073022|10436285|10885524|10927750|10972865|10983150|11005852|11026289|11133385|11431895|11762743|11812065|11812838|12066264|12066265|12071089|12997412|12997413|21460314|24810004|44337675|44337709|44337725|44338149|44338248,103172853|103172953|103173061|103252206|103264934|103264935|103265436|103265479|103265481|103265519|103265733|103265758|103270704|103301311|103328497|103328573|103328577|103328604|103328884|103328913|103329001|103329383|103329511|103329593|103329698|194179160,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11543687,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Targetting high affinity and D(3) versus D(2) receptor-preferring ligands, the partial agonist BP 897 was taken as a lead structure. Variations in the spacer and the aryl moiety led to N-alkylated 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)piperazines with markedly improved affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the structural development. Pharmacophore models for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor ligands were developed from their potentially bioactive conformation and were compared in order to get insight into molecular properties of importance for D(2)/D(3) receptor selectivity. For the 72 compounds presented here, an extended and more linear conformation in the aliphatic or aryl spacers turned out to be crucial for dopamine D(3) receptor selectivity. Structural diversity in the aryl moiety (benzamides, heteroarylamides, arylimides) had a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D(3) receptor affinity, which was optimized with more rigid aryl acrylamide derivatives.

Other structure-dependent efficacy studies in the dopamine D(4) field have suggested a critical interaction of the heteroarylmethyl moiety with specific protein microdomains in controlling intrinsic activity. Our studies indicate that for some binding orientations, the phenylpiperazine moiety also plays a key role in determining efficacy. These data also implicate a kinetic or efficiency term, contained within measured functional affinities for agonists, which support a sequential binding and conformational stabilization model for receptor activation. The structural similarity between partial agonist and antagonist, within this subset of ligands, and lack of bioisosterism for this substituent effect are key phenomena for these hypotheses.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672347,20181018,2099556|5311200|9945233|10064981|10336538|44315403,103165750|103276945|103277054|103277104|103277219|103277288,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15084133,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

They have been evaluated pharmacologically to explore the importance of these substituents for the interaction with central dopamine (DA) receptors. On the basis of biochemical and behavioral data in rats, several of these compounds are characterized as centrally acting DA autoreceptor antagonists. (S)-Phenylpiperidines having an aromatic substituent with a high group dipole moment in the 3-position, i.e., meta with respect to the piperidine ring, and being N-substituted with a propyl group were found to be highly active in vivo on the synthesis and turnover of dopamine. However, they do not induce strong hypoactivity or catalepsy. Interestingly, the most active compounds in vivo were found to display only low affinity for DA D2 and D3 receptors in vitro. In addition, 7-triflate-substituted octahydrobenzo[f]quinolines and 6-triflate-substituted hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indoles have been prepared and pharmacologically evaluated. The trans isomers of these rigid structures were found to display a pharmacological profile similar to that of the flexible phenylpiperidines.

In addition, the intrinsic efficacy was measured as the reduction of forskolin-stimulated cAMP in cells transfected with 5-HT1D alpha and 5-HT1D beta receptors in vitro. The 5-substituted indolyethylamines investigated displayed agonist activity at the 5-HT1D receptors with varying degrees of preference for the 5-HT1D alpha vs the 5-HT1D beta receptors. The primary amine and N,N-dimethyl substitution seemed to be optimal for 5-HT1D alpha affinity.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels. These agents should be of therapeutic value in treating disorders resulting from hypo- and hyperdopaminergic activity, without the side effects associated with complete D2 agonism or antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672799,20181015,44356252,103371645,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9435894,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

63218,Confirmatory,In vitro binding affinity towards Dopamine receptor D2 in human using [3H]-spiperone as radioligand,"Title: Pyrrolo[1,3]benzothiazepine-based serotonin and dopamine receptor antagonists. Molecular modeling, further structure-activity relationship studies, and identification of novel atypical antipsychotic agents._||_Abstract: Recently we reported the pharmacological characterization of the 9,10-dihydropyrrolo[1,3]benzothiazepine derivative (S)-(+)-8 as a novel atypical antipsychotic agent. This compound had an optimum pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratio of 1.21 (pK(i) 5-HT(2A) = 8.83; pK(i) D(2) = 7.79). The lower D(2) receptor affinity of (S)-(+)-8 compared to its enantiomer was explained by the difficulty in reaching the conformation required to optimally fulfill the D(2) pharmacophore. With the aim of finding novel atypical antipsychotics we further investigated the core structure of (S)-(+)-8, synthesizing analogues with specific substituents; the structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was also expanded with the design and synthesis of other analogues characterized by a pyrrolo[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazepine skeleton, substituted on the benzo-fused ring or on the pyrrole system. On the 9,10-dihydro analogues the substituents introduced on the pyrrole ring were detrimental to affinity for dopamine and for 5-HT(2A) receptors, but the introduction of a double bond at C-9/10 on the structure of (S)-(+)-8 led to a potent D(2)/5-HT(2A) receptor ligand with a typical binding profile (9f, pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratio of 1.01, log Y = 8.43). Then, to reduce D(2) receptor affinity and restore atypicality on unsaturated analogues, we exploited the effect of specific substitutions on the tricyclic system of 9f. Through a molecular modeling approach we generated a novel series of potential atypical antipsychotic agents, with optimized 5HT(2A)/D(2) receptor affinity ratios and that were easier to synthesize and purify than the reference compound (S)-(+)-8. A number of SAR trends were identified, and among the analogues synthesized and tested in binding assays, 9d and 9m were identified as the most interesting, giving atypical log Y scores respectively 4.98 and 3.18 (pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratios of 1.20 and 1.30, respectively). They had a multireceptor affinity profile and could be promising atypical agents. Compound 9d, whose synthesis is easier and whose binding profile is atypical (log Y score similar to that of olanzapine, 3.89), was selected for further biological investigation. Pharmacological and biochemical studies confirmed an atypical antipsychotic profile in vivo. The compound was active on conditioned avoidance response at 1.1 mg/kg, a dose 100-times lower than that required to cause catalepsy (ED(50) >90 mg/kg), it induced a negligible increase of prolactin serum levels after single and multiple doses, and antagonized the cognitive impairment induced by phencyclidine. In conclusion, the pharmacological profile of 9d proved better than clozapine and olanzapine, making this compound a potential clinical candidate.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672100,20180908,3559|9796255|135398737,103165765|103167216|103436077,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14695828,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

63226,Confirmatory,Ability to displace [3H]spiperone from human dopamine receptor D2 stably expressed in CHO cells.,"Title: 4-Heterocyclylpiperidines as selective high-affinity ligands at the human dopamine D4 receptor._||_Abstract: 5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-3-(1-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl)pyrazole (3) was identified from screening of the Merck sample collection as a human dopamine D4 (hD4) receptor ligand with moderate affinity (61 nM) and 4-fold selectivity over human D2 (hD2) receptors. Four separate parts of the molecule have been examined systematically to explore structure-activity relationships with respect to hD4 affinity and selectivity over other dopamine receptors. It was found that the 4-chlorophenyl group attached to the pyrazole is optimal, as is the 4-substituted piperidine. The lipophilic group on the basic nitrogen is more amenable to change, with the optimal group found to be a phenethyl. The aromatic heterocyle can be altered to a number of different groups, with isoxazoles and pyrimidines showing improved affinities. This heterocycle can also be advantageously alkylated, improving the selectivity of the compounds over D2 receptors. It is hypothesized that the conformation around the bond joining the aromatic heterocycle to the piperidine is important for D4 affinity, based on crystal structures of isoxazoles (29 and 30) and on a conformationally constrained compound (28). Putting all the favorable changes together led to the discovery that 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)iso xazole (36) is a nanomolar antagonist at human dopamine D4 receptors with > 500-fold selectivity over hD2 and > 200-fold selectivity over hD3.

63227,Confirmatory,Affinity towards Dopamine receptor D2,"Title: CoMFA-based prediction of agonist affinities at recombinant D1 vs D2 dopamine receptors._||_Abstract: We have previously shown that using agonist affinity at recombinant receptors selectively expressed in clonal cells as the dependent variable in three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship studies (3D-QSAR) presents a unique opportunity for accuracy and precision in measurement. Thus, a comparison of affinity's structural determinants for a set of compounds at two different recombinant dopamine receptors represents an attainable goal for 3D-QSAR. A molecular database of bound conformations of 16 structurally diverse agonists was established by alignment with a high-affinity template compound for the D1 receptor, 3-allyl-6-bromo-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepin. A second molecular database of the bound conformations of the same compounds was established against a second template for the D2 receptor, bromocriptine. These aligned structures suggested three-point pharmacophore maps (one cationic nitrogen and two electronegative centers) for the two dopamine receptors, which differed primarily in the height of the nitrogen above the plane of the catechol ring and in the nature of the hydrogen-bonding region. The ln(1/KL) values for the low-affinity agonist binding conformation at recombinant D1 and D2 dopamine receptors stably expressed in C6 glioma cells were used as the target property for the CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) of the 16 aligned structures. The resulting CoMFA models yielded cross-validated R2 (q2) values (standard error of prediction) of 0. 879 (1.471, with five principal components) and 0.834 (1.652, with five principal components) for D1 and D2 affinity, respectively. The simple R2 values (standard error of the estimate) were 0.994 (0.323) and 0.999 (0.116), respectively, for D1 and D2 receptor. F values were 341 and 2465 for D1 and D2 models, respectively, with 5 and 10 df. The predictive utility of the CoMFA model was evaluated at both receptors using the dopamine agonists, apomorphine and 7-OH-DPAT. Predictions of KL were accurate at both receptors. Flexible 3D searches of several chemical databases (NCI, MDDR, CMC, ACD, and Maybridge) were done using basic pharmacophore models at each receptor to determine the similarity of hit lists between the two models. The D1 and D2 models yielded different lists of lead compounds. Several of the lead compounds closely resembled high-affinity training set compounds. Finally, homology modeling of agonist binding to the D2 receptor revealed some consistencies and inconsistencies with the CoMFA-derived D2 model and provided a possible rationale for features of the D2 CoMFA contour map. Together these results suggest that CoMFA-homology based models may provide useful insights concerning differential agonist-receptor interactions at related receptors. The results also suggest that comparisons of CoMFA models for two structurally related receptors may be a fruitful approach for differential QSAR.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672210,20181016,681|3341|5610|11492|28864|47811|54562|122132|167715|6603820|6603954|6852376|10452020|12668019|44331310|44358192,103167911|103172070|103175300|103181504|103194192|103197419|103209873|103316191|103387788|103408740|103512529|103543557|103734524|103734547|103734609|103760873,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9784114,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The affinities of the compounds for [3H]raclopride-labeled cloned human dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors as well as [3H]-8-OH-DPAT-labeled rat hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors were determined. In order to selectively determine affinities for the high-affinity agonist binding site at DA D2 receptors, the agonist [3H]quinpirole was used. The intrinsic activities of the compounds at DA D2 and D3 receptors were evaluated in a [35S]GTP gamma S binding assay. The novel compounds were characterized as dopaminergic antagonists or inverse agonists. The antagonist (R)-2-(butylpropylamino)-5-fluorotetralin (16) bound with high affinity (Ki = 4.4 nM) to the DA D3 receptor and was the most D3-selective compound (10-fold). (R)-2-[[4-(8-Aza-7, 9-dioxospiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)butyl]propylamino]-5-fluorote tralin (18) bound with very high affinity to both DA D3 and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.2 nM) and was also characterized as a dopaminergic antagonist. (R)-2-(Benzylpropylamino)-5-fluorotetralin (10) behaved as an inverse agonist at both DA D2 and D3 receptors.

However, a major disadvantage of many current medications are the observed extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), postulated to arise from D(2) receptor antagonism. Consequently, a selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist could offer an attractive antipsychotic therapy, devoid of the unwanted EPS. Using SAR information gained in two previously reported series of potent and selective D(3) receptor antagonists, as exemplified by the 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine 10 and the 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindoline 11, a range of 7-sulfonyloxy- and 7-sulfonylbenzazepines has been prepared. Compounds of this type combined a high level of D(3) affinity and selectivity vs D(2) with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in the rat. Subsequent optimization of this series to improve selectivity over a range of receptors and reduce cytochrome P450 inhibitory potential gave trans-3-(2-(4-((3-(3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxidiazolyl))phenyl)carboxamido)cyclohexyl)ethyl)-7-methylsulfonyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (58, SB-414796). This compound is a potent and selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist with high oral bioavailability and is CNS penetrant in the rat. Subsequent evaluation in the rat has shown that 58 preferentially reduces firing of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (A10) compared to the substantia nigra (A9), an observation consistent with a prediction for atypical antipsychotic efficacy. In a separate study, 58 has been shown to block expression of the conditioned place preference (CPP) response to cocaine in male rats, suggesting that it may also have a role in the treatment of cue-induced relapse in drug-free cocaine addicts.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL674348,20181017,45262323|45262339|45262343|45262345|45262347|45262348|45262349|45262363|45262369|45262381|45262384|45262385|45262402|45262403|45262404|45262410|45262412|45262415|45262416|45262417|45264008|45265219|45265240|45265244|45265257|45265266|45265305|45265589|45265590|45265597|45265605|45265612|45265633,163312675|163316033|163319496|163329760|163336742|174484820|174484821|174489875|174500115|174500117|174505298|174515586|174515587|174515589|174520684|174520685|174520686|194137837|194137838|194151548|194151549|194151552|194158572|194158575|194158576|194165503|194165506|194165508|194172363|194172365|194172370|194186050|194186053,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14584946,0,,P14416,,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors (previously known as 5-HT1Dbeta and 5-HT1Dalpha, respectively), although encoded by two distinct genes, are structurally very similar. Pharmacologically, these two receptors have been differentiated using nonselective chemical tools such as ketanserin and ritanserin, but the absence of truly selective agents has meant that the precise function of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors has not been defined. In this paper we describe how, using computational chemistry models as a guide, the nonselective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor antagonist 4 was structurally modified to produce the selective 5-HT1B receptor inverse agonist 5, 1'-methyl-5-[[2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]carbonyl]-2,3,6, 7-tetrahydrospiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4'-piperidine] (SB-224289).

Fluorescein and/or NBD (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) derivatives of PPHT (D-2 agonist), spiperone (D-2 antagonist), SKF 38393 (D-1 agonist), and SKF 83566 (D-1 antagonist) were synthesized via their amino-functionalized analogues and all ligands were pharmacologically evaluated by measuring their ability to displace [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiperone from D-1 and D-2 receptor sites in caudate putamen of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). The fluorescein derivatives of PPHT and SKF 83566 and the NBD derivatives of spiperone and SKF 83566 retained the high affinity and selectivity of the parent ligands. The NBD derivatives of PPHT showed higher D-2 receptor affinity and selectivity than their parent ligands. The enantiomers of the fluorescent derivatives of PPHT were also synthesized and were found to exhibit stereoselectivity in binding to the D-2 receptor, with the S enantiomers having a considerably higher affinity than their R analogues. In contrast to these results, the fluorescein derivative of SKF 38393 showed only a low affinity for the D-1 receptor. These fluorescein- and NBD-coupled D-1 and D-2 receptor ligands have considerable significance as potential probes in the study of distribution of the receptors at the cellular/subcellular level and of their mobility in membranes in normal/diseased states by use of fluorescence microscopic and fluorescence photobleaching recovery techniques, respectively.

The affinities of these compounds for the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor classes and for their effects on adenylate cyclase activity were assessed in rat striatal membranes. In addition to producing only minimal increases in adenylate cyclase activity (< or = 15%), these phenolic derivatives generally had significantly lower affinities for D1 and D2 receptors (D1 IC50 > or = 102 nM, D2 IC50 > or = 210 nM) than did their catechol analogues. Further, compounds bearing a cis B/C-ring fusion displayed lower affinities than those bearing a trans configuration, paralleling the activity differences between the catechol analogues.

When incubated with mouse or monkey liver S9 microsomes, (R)-3 is metabolized by N-demethylation and oxidation to (R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(methylamino)-4H-imidazo[4,5,1-ij]quinolin-2(1H) -one [(R)-6], intermediate metabolites, where N-demethylation to the imidazoquinoline (R)-4 and where oxidation to the imidazoquinolinone (R)-5 has taken place, are also observed in these incubates. A cross-species study on the metabolism of (R)-3 in vitro has shown large variations in the extent of metabolism from species to species.

These compounds are conformationally restricted, angular tricyclic analogs of 2-aminotetralin. The synthesis was achieved in several steps from the corresponding 2-tetralones. The enantiomers of the cis analogs were obtained from either fractional recrystallizations of the diastereomeric salts of di-p-toluoyl-L-(or D)-tartaric acid or an asymmetric synthesis using chiral (R)-alpha-methylbenzylamine. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests.

In this case, the trans analogs possessed equal or higher in vitro 5-HT1A affinity than the corresponding cis analogs.

These cis and trans analogs of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole (3), where a five-membered ring is fused between the nitrogen and C-3 carbon of 2-aminotetralin, were synthesized from 5-methoxy- and 8-methoxytetralones. The enantiomers of trans-5-methoxy-N-n-propyl and -N-allyl analogs were obtained via fractional recrystallization of their di-p-toluoyl-L (or D) tartaric acid salts. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests. In the 5-substituted series (R1 in 3), the trans isomers were found to possess higher levels of pharmacological activity then the corresponding cis isomers. The trans-5-methoxy analogs showed selective 5-HT1A receptor activity in vitro but displayed mixed 5-HT1A and D2 agonist properties in vivo. The corresponding trans-5-hydroxy analogs were found to be potent D2 agonists with full intrinsic activity. An examination of nitrogen substitution (R2 in 3) revealed that analogs with either an allyl or an n-propyl group displayed equipotent activities. Substitution with a cyclopropylmethyl or benzyl group resulted in reduced activity. Among the resolved analogs tested, the activity was found to reside exclusively in the (3aS)-(-)-enantiomers. In the 8-substituted series (R1 in 3), only 8-methoxy-N-allyl analogs were synthesized and evaluated. In this case, both cis and trans isomers showed equally weak in vitro 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity devoid of dopaminergic effects.

These peptidomimetics were designed to examine the following: (1) the effect that changing the size of the thiazolidine and lactam ring systems would have on the ability of these systems to mimic the type-II beta-turn and (2) the effect that these structural perturbations would have on the ability of the peptidomimetics to modulate dopamine receptors. Through the use of the [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) dopamine D2 receptor competitive binding assay, 3 and 4, at a concentration of 100 nM, decreased the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor for the agonist. These effects were observed when either Gpp(NH)p was absent or present and they were comparable to those produced by PLG at a concentration of 1 microM. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 also increased the percentage of D2 receptors that existed in the high-affinity state. Even with Gpp(NH)p present, 3 and 4 were able to return the RH/RL ratios to values observed in the respective controls where Gpp(NH)p was absent. Furthermore, both peptidomimetics were able to attenuate the Gpp(NH)p-induced shift to the low-affinity state to a greater extent than PLG. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 were evaluated in vivo as modulators of apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of hemiparkinsonism, and each affected the rotational behavior in a bell-shaped dose-response relationship producing increases of 95 +/- 31% (0.01 mg/kg, ip) and 88 +/- 14% (0.001 mg/kg, ip), respectively.

These compounds are important for defining the pharmacophore for D-2 antagonist activity due to their limited conformational freedom. Possible foldings of the multicyclic structure were energy minimized and the barriers for inversion and for rotation of the ammonium group were computed. The conformational properties of 1 and 2 are consistent with a pharmacophore recently proposed by Liljefors and Bøgesø. The greater affinity of (S)-octoclothepin for D-2 receptors as compared with its enantiomer was attributed to the latter having an incorrect orientation of the ammonium hydrogen despite the correct folding of the tricyclic structure. Other D-2 antagonists with limited conformational freedom such as butaclamol, isobutaclamol, loxapine, clozapine, and resolved cyproheptadine analogues were also found to be consistent with the pharmacophore. In addition, 1, 2, and their enantiomers were tested on radioligand binding assays for dopamine D-1, dopamine D-2, noradrenergic alpha-1, serotonergic 5-HT2, muscarinic, and sigma receptors. 1 and 2 have greater affinities than their enantiomers in the D-1, D-2, alpha-1, and 5-HT2 assays though there was little difference between 2 and its enantiomer in the latter two assays. In the muscarinic assays, 2 and its enantiomer, which were approximately equipotent, had greater affinity than 1 and its enantiomer. None of the compounds had substantial affinity for sigma receptors.

The synthesis and biological testing of compounds 2-7 has been previously reported. The test compounds were compared both quantitatively and graphically to compound 1. Calculations on both the free-base and protonated forms of each compound were carried out. To insure that conformation space was adequately sampled, the test compounds were energy minimized from different starting geometries; ring inversion of the heterocycle was employed, as were dihedral driver calculations on the phenyl or benzyl rings. For N-methyl-6-chloro-7-hydroxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (2), it was determined that the torsion angle tau(C8a-C1-C12-C17) had energy minima at approximately 60 degrees and 240 degrees. This finding was corroborated by NMR studies that indicated a dramatic upfield chemical shift of ArH8 after ring cyclization. The nitrogen lone pair or hydrogen vector was approximately orthogonal to the plane of the substituted aromatic ring in the tetrahydroisoquinolines; this explained the upfield chemical shift of the vicinal chiral proton (H1).

Distance comparisons of the proposed pharmacophoric atoms (Cl, N, O, centroid of the phenyl or benzyl ring) showed that the phenyl or benzyl centroid to ammonium H distance, Cl to N distance, and distance of the nitrogen above or below the plane of the isoquinoline aromatic ring are the distances most highly correlated with biological activity (r = 0.82, 0.75, 0.81, respectively). Resolution and single-crystal X-ray analysis of compound 2 showed the most active enantiomer to possess the S absolute configuration, in contrast to the benzazepine (R)-1. Least-squares fitting of the energy-minimized structures with SYBYL molecular modeling software showed (S)-(+)-2, rather than (R)-(-)-2, gave a better fit to (R)-1. Volume determinations derived from SYBYL multifit analyses aided in receptor mapping to qualitatively describe areas of 'active' pharmacophore space as well as areas of 'inactive' substituent space.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670683,20181012,3036864|10107367|14198585|14198587|14198590|14198597|14198601,103168087|103255004|103255152|103255153|103255154|103255210|103255211,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2527994,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The compounds were synthesized by substituting the chlorine atom of benzonaphthyridines and azepinoquinolines with various N-alkyl-4-piperidinylmethanolates. They were evaluated in binding assays with [(3)H]GR 113808 as the 5-HT(4) receptor radioligand. The affinity values (K(i) or inhibition percentages) depended upon the substituent on the aromatic ring on one hand and the substituent on the lateral piperidine chain on the other hand. A chlorine atom produced a marked drop in activity while a N-propyl or N-butyl group gave compounds with nanomolar affinities (1 < K(i) < 10 nM). Among the most potent ligands (3a, 4a, 5a), 4a was selected on the basis of its high affinity and selectivity for pharmacological screening and was evaluated in vivo in specific tests. This compound reveals itself as an antagonist/low partial agonist in the COS-7 cells stably expressing the 5-HT(4(a)) receptor.

Most of these compounds showed potent antipsychotic-like activity in an apomorphine-induced climbing mouse paradigm, with many also showing preferential mesolimbic activity, as indicated by their weaker effects in an apomorphine-induced stereotypy model. In receptor binding assays, many displayed a moderate affinity for the D2 receptor coupled with a significantly greater affinity for the 5-HT2 receptor: a property that has been suggested as necessary for atypicality. From this series, compound 45, 1-[4-[3-[4-(6-fluoro-1,2-benzisoxazol-3-yl)-1- piperidinyl]propoxy]-3-methoxyphenyl]ethanone (iloperidone, HP 873), was further evaluated in a battery of in vivo and in vitro assays. This compound showed a 300-fold greater potency in inhibition of climbing than in inhibition of stereotypy or induction of catalepsy, and when evaluated chronically in an electrophysiological model, 45 caused a depolarization blockade of dopamine neurons in the A10 area of the rat brain but not in the A9 area. Additionally, it showed positive activity in a social interaction paradigm, suggesting potential efficacy against asociality, a component of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In chronic ex vivo studies, 45, similar to clozapine, caused a down regulation of 5-HT2 receptors but had no effect on the number of D2 receptors.

This drug also possesses potent activity at several other brain receptors (most notably alpha 1 adrenergic receptors). We have prepared the enantiomers and diastereomers of ifenprodil along with a series of partial structures in order to explore the basic structure activity relations within this class of compounds. From this study, it is clear that alpha 1 adrenergic and NMDA receptor activities may be separated by selection of the threo relative stereochemistry. Examination of the optical isomers of threo-ifenprodil (2) reveals that no further improvement in receptor selectivity is gained from either antipode. Individual removal of most of the structural fragments from the ifenprodil molecule generally results in less active compounds although fluorinated derivative 9 with threo relative stereochemistry is somewhat more potent and substantially more selective for the NMDA receptor. Finally a minimum structure for activity in this series (14) has been identified. This stripped-down version of ifenprodil possesses nearly equivalent affinity for the NMDA receptor with no selectivity over alpha 1 adrenergic receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671344,20181013,3689,124960908,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1681106,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

64134,Literature-derived,Intrinsic activity was Determined,"Title: Comparison of 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 pharmacophores. X-ray structures and affinities of conformationally constrained ligands._||_Abstract: Conformational and molecular mechanics studies of a new series of tricyclic ligands with affinity for either the dopamine D2 receptor or the 5-HT1A receptor, or both, has enabled us to elaborate considerably on previous pharmacophore models for these receptors. The new tricyclic ligands are either angular, 2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indole derivatives, or linear, 2,3,3a,4,5,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives; they have either cis or trans ring junctions, and many of the ligands are resolved. In order to have X-ray crystal coordinates for every structural type, two additional crystal structures were determined: 14a, the trans-(+-)-6-hydroxy-3-(n-propyl) angular derivative as the hydrochloride, and (+-)-1,2,2a,3,4,8b-hexahydro-8-methoxy-2-(2-propenyl)-naphth[2,1- b]azetidine hydrochloride (16d). Several recently reported imidazoquinolinones with dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were also used in developing the models as were other known ligands which are conformationally constrained. A new method for determining intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor made consistent and reliable estimates of dopamine agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities available. The models explain these activities in terms of the 3-dimensional structural features of the ligands and their probable orientations at the D2 receptor site. They also explain why allyl and propyl analogs of some structures have very different affinities while affinities are quite similar for allyl and propyl analogs of other structures; at both receptors a particular orientation of the amine substituent in the binding site correlates with preference for allyl over propyl derivatives. Suggestions are made for enhancing selectivity at the 5-HT1A receptor or at the dopamine D2 receptor. An angular, cis, (3aR,9bS), 2-propyl, 9-hydroxy, 3-(n-propyl) analog should be selective for the 5-HT1A receptor.

In addition to its full D1 agonist properties, 2 also is a good ligand for D2-like dopamine receptors. The profound anti-Parkinsonian actions of this compound make determination of its enantioselectivity at both D1 and D2 receptors of particular importance. To accomplish this, the enantiomers were resolved by preparation of diastereomeric (R)-O-methylmandelic acid amides of racemic trans-10,11-dimethoxy-5,6,6a,7,8,12b- hexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridine 4 that were then separated by centrifugal chromatography. An X-ray analysis of the (-)-N-(R)-O-methylmandel diastereoamide revealed the absolute configuration to be 6aS,12bR. Removal of the chiral auxiliary and O,O-deprotection afforded enantiomeric amines that were then tested for biological activity. In striatal membranes, the (6aR,12bS)-(+)-enantiomer 2 had about twice the affinity of the racemate and 25-fold greater affinity than the (-)-enantiomer at the D1 receptor labeled by [3H]SCH23390 (K0.5s of 5.6, 11.6, and 149 nM, respectively). Similarly, the (+)-enantiomer 2 had about twice the affinity of the racemate for human D1 receptors expressed in transfected Ltk- cells. Functionally, the (+)-enantiomer of 2 was a full agonist, with an EC50 of 51 nM in activating striatal dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase versus 2.15 microM for the (-)-enantiomer. With respect to D2-like receptors, (+)-2 had a K0.5 of 87.7 nM in competing with [3H]spiperone at D2 binding sites in rat striatal membranes versus about 1 microM for the (-)-enantiomer. Together, these data demonstrate that both the D1 and D2 activities of dihydrexidine reside principally in the (6aR,12bS)-(+)-enantiomer. The results are discussed in the context of structure-activity relationships and conceptual models of the D1 receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670779,20181014,6603820,103197419,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7914538,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0
64136,Confirmatory,Low-affinity agonist dissociation constant against striatal Dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Comparative molecular field analysis-based prediction of drug affinities at recombinant D1A dopamine receptors._||_Abstract: Determination of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for affinity at particular dopamine (DA) receptors has become an even greater priority with the cloning of five DA receptor subtypes. The use of agonist affinity at recombinant receptors selectively expressed in clonal cells as the dependent variable in QSAR presents a unique opportunity for accuracy and precision in measurement of biological values. Bound conformations of 11 agonists (for which both affinity data at the recombinant D1A DA receptor and stereochemical configurations were available) were determined by alignment with a template compound, SKF38393, which shows high affinity and selectivity for D1A receptors and is fairly rigid in structure. These aligned structures suggested a 3-point pharmacophore map (one cationic nitrogen and two electronegative centers) of the D1A DA receptor. This map shows both similarities and differences when compared with a previously reported D2 DA receptor pharmacophore map based on biological data from rat brain and with a recently published map of the native D1 DA receptor using several semirigid compounds. Log(1/K(d)) values at recombinant D1A DA receptors were used as the target property for a CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) of the 11 aligned structures. The resulting CoMFA model yielded a cross-validated r(2)(q(2)) value of 0.829 and a simple r(2) = 0.96. In contrast, when a CoMFA model was developed for 10 of these compounds using striatal D1 K(d) values, the q(2) value was reduced to 0.178. These results are consistent with the idea that drug affinity data obtained from clonal cells expressing recombinant receptors may be superior to that obtained using heterogeneous mixtures of native receptors prepared from brain membranes. The predictive utility of the CoMFA model was evaluated using several high-affinity dopamine agonists and m- and p-tyramine, two compounds with a single hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring. Predictions were fairly accurate for all compounds but the two tyramines.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670780,20181015,6005,103167211,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8632409,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

The binding profile showed a 13-fold preference for r5-HT1B (Ki = 47 +/- 5 nM; n = 3) vs bovine 5-HT1B (Ki = 630 nM; n = 1) receptors. The compound had very low affinity for other monoaminergic receptors examined. The r5-HT1B receptor antagonism was demonstrated by the potentiation of the K+-stimulated release of [3H]-5-HT from superfused rat brain slices in vitro, an effect that was antagonized by addition of 5-HT to the superfusion fluid. (R)-25 at 20 mg/kg sc enhanced the 5-HT turnover in four rat brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and frontal cortex) with about 40% measured as the 5-HTP accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine. At 3 mg/kg sc (R)-25 produced a significant increase in the number of wet dog shakes in rats, a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C response that was abolished by depletion of 5-HT after pretreatment with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine. These observations show that (R)-25, by inhibiting terminal r5-HT1B autoreceptors, increases the 5-HT turnover and the synaptic concentration of 5-HT.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670785,20181015,9955014|49860422,104235277|131281414,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9599242,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Consequently, the 8-OTf-substituted compound R-(+)-6 was found to be a potent and selective 5-HT1A (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor agonist inducing a full-blown 5-HT syndrome in normal rats, while the corresponding 5-OTf-substituted compound S-(-)-12 was found to be a preferential dopamine (DA) autoreceptor agonist. A partial 5-HT syndrome was also observed for S-(-)-12, while the corresponding R-(+)-12 was found to be inactive at the DA and 5-HT receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Compounds 6 and 12 were found to be major urinary metabolites following oral administration of their dipropyl analogs (2 and 13, respectively). Thus 6 was proposed to be the metabolite responsible for the full-blown 5-HT syndrome seen after oral (but not subcutaneous) administration of 2.

64159,Confirmatory,Tested for binding affinity against dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Antagonism of 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane stimulus with a newly identified 5-HT2- versus 5-HT1C-selective antagonist._||_Abstract: DOM [i.e., 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenyl)-2-aminopropane] is a 5-HT1C/2 serotonin agonist that exerts stimulus control of behavior in animals. In order to determine if the discriminative stimulus effect of DOM is 5-HT1C- or 5-HT2-mediated, it would be informative to conduct tests of stimulus antagonism with a 5-HT1C- or 5-HT2-selective antagonist. To date, no such agents exist. Although the neuroleptic agent spiperone binds at D2 dopamine receptors and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors, (a) it displays about a 1000-fold selectivity for 5-HT2 versus 5-HT1C sites and (b) it has been used as a '5-HT2-selective' antagonist. Because spiperone is a behaviorally disruptive agent, it is not suitable for use in drug-discrimination studies. Using the spiperone molecule as a starting point, a limited structure-affinity investigation was conducted in order to identify a suitable antagonist with high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT2 receptors, and yet an antagonist that might lack the disruptive actions of spiperone. Various modifications of the spiperone molecule were examined, but most resulted in decreased 5-HT2 affinity or in loss of selectivity. One compound, 8-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-1-phenyl-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]de can-4-on e (26), was shown to bind at 5-HT2 sites with high affinity (Ki = 2 nM) and > 2,000-fold selectivity versus 5-HT1C sites. In tests of stimulus antagonism using rats trained to discriminate 1 mg/kg of DOM from saline vehicle, 26 behaved as a potent antagonist (ED50 = 0.003 mg/kg) and lacked the disruptive effects associated with spiperone. As such, (a) it would appear that the DOM stimulus is primarily a 5-HT2-mediated, and not 5-HT1C-mediated, phenomenon, and (b) compound 26 may find application in other pharmacologic investigations where spiperone may not be a suitable antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673098,20181013,5265|68186,103167959|103283755,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8355253,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The structure-activity relationships surrounding this compound were studied by synthesis of analogues and evaluation of their dopaminergic activity. The cyclohexene substitution pattern was varied along with the length of the chain connecting the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine to the cyclohexene. Compound 14, having the 1,3-substitution pattern and a single methylene chain, was the most potent. The 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine could be replaced by other aryl-cyclic amines with a slight loss in activity. The phenyl group on the cyclohexene ring could be para substituted; electron-donating groups were better tolerated than electron-withdrawing groups. Finally, the enantiomers of 14 were resolved via the 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate salts. Although both isomers were partial DA agonists, the (+)-enantiomer had higher intrinsic activity than the (-)-enantiomer. Syntheses were developed that allowed rapid preparation of analogues. An X-ray crystal structure determination of an intermediate identified the (+)-isomer of 14 as having R configuration. This compound, designated CI-1007 (PD 143188), was found to have antipsychotic-like activity in behavioral tests; in particular, it was orally active in the conditioned avoidance test in squirrel monkeys with an ED50 of 0.6 mg/kg.

The differences in pharmacological profiles were rationalized by modeling of ligand-receptor interactions using homology-based receptor models of the 5-HT1A and D2A receptor binding site. The selective and pronounced serotonergic effects of 3 appear to be due to the C10-methyl group, which is accommodated by a lipophilic pocket in the 5-HT1A receptor.

The absolute configuration of the respective (R)- and (S)-enantiomers was deduced from X-ray crystallography of (R)-3-(N-isopropylamino)-5-methoxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran, (R)-9a. Various 5-substituents were introduced via palladium-catalyzed carbonylation of N-substituted 3-amino-5-trifluoromethanesulfonyloxy-3,4-dihydro-2H-1-benzopyran. The effect of N- and 5-substitution on affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor was evaluated in competition experiments using rat hippocampal membranes and [3H]8-OH-DPAT as radioligand. Selected compounds were also tested for their affinity to the D1 (rat striatum), D2 (rat striatum), D2A (human cloned), and 5-HT2A (rat cortex) receptors. The intrinsic activity of the compounds was evaluated by measuring their effect on VIP-stimulated cAMP production in GH4ZD10 cells stably transfected with the 5-HT1A receptor. High-affinity compounds with high selectivity for the 5-HT1A receptor were found among structures substituted with carboxylate esters, amides, and ketones in the 5-position.

In addition, the enantiomers of the N-isopropyl-N-n-propylamino derivative of 3 were prepared. The new derivatives were tested in vivo by use of behavioral and biochemical tests in rats. In addition, the affinity of the compounds was studied by competition experiments with [3H]-8-OH-DPAT in rat brain tissue. The only new derivative which behaved like a selective 5-HT1A-receptor agonist was the C8-carboxamide derivative (1S,2R)-13.

64315,Confirmatory,Equilibrium dissociation constant against recombinant Dopamine receptor D2A expressed in COS7 cells,"Title: Comparative molecular field analysis-based prediction of drug affinities at recombinant D1A dopamine receptors._||_Abstract: Determination of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for affinity at particular dopamine (DA) receptors has become an even greater priority with the cloning of five DA receptor subtypes. The use of agonist affinity at recombinant receptors selectively expressed in clonal cells as the dependent variable in QSAR presents a unique opportunity for accuracy and precision in measurement of biological values. Bound conformations of 11 agonists (for which both affinity data at the recombinant D1A DA receptor and stereochemical configurations were available) were determined by alignment with a template compound, SKF38393, which shows high affinity and selectivity for D1A receptors and is fairly rigid in structure. These aligned structures suggested a 3-point pharmacophore map (one cationic nitrogen and two electronegative centers) of the D1A DA receptor. This map shows both similarities and differences when compared with a previously reported D2 DA receptor pharmacophore map based on biological data from rat brain and with a recently published map of the native D1 DA receptor using several semirigid compounds. Log(1/K(d)) values at recombinant D1A DA receptors were used as the target property for a CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) of the 11 aligned structures. The resulting CoMFA model yielded a cross-validated r(2)(q(2)) value of 0.829 and a simple r(2) = 0.96. In contrast, when a CoMFA model was developed for 10 of these compounds using striatal D1 K(d) values, the q(2) value was reduced to 0.178. These results are consistent with the idea that drug affinity data obtained from clonal cells expressing recombinant receptors may be superior to that obtained using heterogeneous mixtures of native receptors prepared from brain membranes. The predictive utility of the CoMFA model was evaluated using several high-affinity dopamine agonists and m- and p-tyramine, two compounds with a single hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring. Predictions were fairly accurate for all compounds but the two tyramines.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671443,20181015,6005|167715|6852376,103167211|103194192|103512529,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8632409,0,,P14416,,207.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The molecular masses of three major metabolites suggested that they were mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives of 1. We synthesized compounds 2 and 3, the two possible mono-p-hydroxyphenyl derivatives of 1, along with the bis-p-hydroxyphenyl derivative 4. These compounds coeluted by HPLC with the three hydroxylated metabolites of 1. Compounds 2-4 all had high affinities for DA D2 and D3 receptors and moderate affinities for D4 receptors. Like 1, compound 2 decreased DA synthesis and neuronal firing in rat brain, indicative of DA autoreceptor activation. Compound 2 inhibited exploratory locomotor activity in rodents and was active in the Sidman avoidance test in squirrel monkeys, predictive of antipsychotic activity in humans. Compounds 3 and 4 showed weak activity in all these tests. After squirrel monkeys were dosed with 1 orally at the ED100 dose of the Sidman avoidance test, the plasma concentration of 2 was below the limit of quantitation.

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672520,20181016,54562,103543557,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR.

In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1.

In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

A QSAR model highlighted the importance of lipophilicity and ionization in controlling beta(2) duration. It was found that design rules logD(7.4) > 2, secondary amine pK(a) > 8.0, yielded ultra-long duration compounds. This model was used successfully to guide the design of long- and ultra-long-acting compounds. The QSAR model is discussed in terms of the exosite model, and the plasmalemma diffusion microkinetic hypothesis, for the control of beta(2) duration. Data presented strongly suggests that beta(2) duration is primarily controlled by the membrane affinity of these compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL684365,20181017,9956101|10319630|10320619|11677323|19082152|44339032|44339091,103330805|103330974|103331009|103331335|103331475|103331548|103331684,1813,In vivo,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12852752,0,,P14416,10141.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

These peptidomimetics were designed to examine the following: (1) the effect that changing the size of the thiazolidine and lactam ring systems would have on the ability of these systems to mimic the type-II beta-turn and (2) the effect that these structural perturbations would have on the ability of the peptidomimetics to modulate dopamine receptors. Through the use of the [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) dopamine D2 receptor competitive binding assay, 3 and 4, at a concentration of 100 nM, decreased the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor for the agonist. These effects were observed when either Gpp(NH)p was absent or present and they were comparable to those produced by PLG at a concentration of 1 microM. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 also increased the percentage of D2 receptors that existed in the high-affinity state. Even with Gpp(NH)p present, 3 and 4 were able to return the RH/RL ratios to values observed in the respective controls where Gpp(NH)p was absent. Furthermore, both peptidomimetics were able to attenuate the Gpp(NH)p-induced shift to the low-affinity state to a greater extent than PLG. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 were evaluated in vivo as modulators of apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of hemiparkinsonism, and each affected the rotational behavior in a bell-shaped dose-response relationship producing increases of 95 +/- 31% (0.01 mg/kg, ip) and 88 +/- 14% (0.001 mg/kg, ip), respectively.

227608,Literature-derived,Intrinsic activity against dopamine D 2 receptor,"Title: Comparison of 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 pharmacophores. X-ray structures and affinities of conformationally constrained ligands._||_Abstract: Conformational and molecular mechanics studies of a new series of tricyclic ligands with affinity for either the dopamine D2 receptor or the 5-HT1A receptor, or both, has enabled us to elaborate considerably on previous pharmacophore models for these receptors. The new tricyclic ligands are either angular, 2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indole derivatives, or linear, 2,3,3a,4,5,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives; they have either cis or trans ring junctions, and many of the ligands are resolved. In order to have X-ray crystal coordinates for every structural type, two additional crystal structures were determined: 14a, the trans-(+-)-6-hydroxy-3-(n-propyl) angular derivative as the hydrochloride, and (+-)-1,2,2a,3,4,8b-hexahydro-8-methoxy-2-(2-propenyl)-naphth[2,1- b]azetidine hydrochloride (16d). Several recently reported imidazoquinolinones with dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were also used in developing the models as were other known ligands which are conformationally constrained. A new method for determining intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor made consistent and reliable estimates of dopamine agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities available. The models explain these activities in terms of the 3-dimensional structural features of the ligands and their probable orientations at the D2 receptor site. They also explain why allyl and propyl analogs of some structures have very different affinities while affinities are quite similar for allyl and propyl analogs of other structures; at both receptors a particular orientation of the amine substituent in the binding site correlates with preference for allyl over propyl derivatives. Suggestions are made for enhancing selectivity at the 5-HT1A receptor or at the dopamine D2 receptor. An angular, cis, (3aR,9bS), 2-propyl, 9-hydroxy, 3-(n-propyl) analog should be selective for the 5-HT1A receptor. A linear, trans, (3aR,9aS), 7-hydroxy, 1-(2-propenyl) analog should be selective for the dopamine D2 receptor, and would be predicted to be an antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872123,20181013,47811|122334|6604756|9882257|10014056|10014057|10105311|10105844|10332127|10355219|10377224|10466962|14944887|18988817|18988835|22849991|22849992|44266612|44266623|44266636|44266651|44266689|44274687|44274739|44275015|44275135|44275155|44275362|44275604|44275615|44275616|44275766,103170221|103170246|103170275|103170310|103170342|103170445|103171763|103171824|103171864|103171983|103175300|103193583|103193697|103193716|103193719|103193873|103194077|103194161|103194373|103194409|103194492|103194647|103194729|103194863|103195296|103195323|103195324|103195613|103195643|103244512|103700484|163333467,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496900,0,,P14416,10029.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity.

This molecule was designed to conserve the essential elements contained in our D1 agonist pharmacophore model (i.e., position and orientation of the nitrogen, hydroxyls, and phenyl rings). It involved taking the backbone of dihydrexidine [3; (+/-)-trans-10, 11-dihydroxy-5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydrobenzo[a] phenanthridine], the first high-affinity full D1 agonist, and tethering the two phenyl rings of dihydrexidine through a methylene bridge and removing the C(7)-C(8) ethano bridge. Preliminary molecular modeling studies demonstrated that these modifications conserved the essential elements of the hypothesized pharmacopore. Dinapsoline 4 had almost identical affinity (KI = 5.9 nM) to 3 at rat striatal D1 receptors and had a shallow competition curve (nH = 0.66) that suggested agonist properties. Consistent with this, in both rat striatum and C-6-mD1 cells, dinapsoline 4 was a full agonist with an EC50 of ca. 30 nM in stimulating synthesis of cAMP via D1 receptors. The design and synthesis of dinapsoline 4 provide a powerful test of the model of the D1 pharmacophore we have developed and provide another chemical series that can be useful probes for the study of D1 receptors. An interesting property of 3 is that it also has relatively high D2 affinity (K0.5 = 50 nM) despite having an accessory phenyl ring usually though to convey D1 selectivity. Dinapsoline 4 was found to have even higher affinity for the D2 receptor (K0.5 = 31 nM) than 3. Because of the high affinity of 4 for D2 receptors, it and its analogs can be powerful tools for exploring the mechanisms of 'functional selectivity' (i.e., that 3 is an agonist at some D2 receptors, but an antagonist at others). Together, these data suggest that 4 and its derivatives may be powerful tools in the study of dopamine receptor function and also have potential clinical utility in Parkinson's disease and other conditions where perturbation of dopamine receptors is useful.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844901,20200704,2726|6603820|9816455,103169389|103197419|103350746,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8558526,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand.

In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1.

238699,Confirmatory,Binding affinity for human dopamine receptor D2 long,"Title: Modeling the similarity and divergence of dopamine D2-like receptors and identification of validated ligand-receptor complexes._||_Abstract: Focusing on the similarity and divergence of GPCR subtypes and their ligand interactions, we generated dopamine D2, D3, and D4 receptor models based on the rhodopsin crystal structure and refined these with an extensive MM/MD protocol. After validation by diagnostic experimental data, subtype-specific relative positions of TM1, 2, 6, and 7 and bending angles of TM7 were found.

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1. In summary, chemical modification of 1 has resulted in compounds with high affinity and selectivity for D3 receptors. The most promising candidate, compound 29, is currently being evaluated in animal models of cocaine abuse and will provide an important tool with which to elucidate the role of D3 receptors in drug reinforcement in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL838013,20181018,9891901|9980998|10001256|10276451|11223885|11224283|11307083|11316847|11351639|11375068|11408148|11477180,103252237|103252954|103265882|103381942|103440227|103440257|103440298|103440349|103440417|103463820|103463979|103464153,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15689168,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Contraction of the 10-membered central ring decreases them significantly.

Various structural modifications were performed and the inhibitory activities at human cloned D(1), D(2L), and D(5) receptors were measured by using a simple fluorescence microplate reader based calcium assay. Subsequently, the affinities of active compounds were estimated by radioligand binding experiments. Deleting one of the aromatic rings as well as replacing it by a phenyl moiety abolishes the inhibitory activities almost completely. Contraction of the 10-membered central ring decreases them significantly.

Centrally administered ghrelin has been shown to cause hunger and increase food intake in rodents. Inhibition of ghrelin actions with ghrelin antibody, peptidyl GHS-R antagonists, and antisense oligonucleosides resulted in weight loss and food intake decrease in rodents. Here we report the effects of GHS-R antagonists, some of which were potent, selective, and orally bioavailable.

The most potent compounds exhibited K(i) values toward the D(3) receptor in the nano- to subnanomolar range and high selectivity versus the related D(2) dopamine receptor. Thus, 1H-pyridin-2-one 7b displays oral bioavailability (F=37%) as well as brain penetration (brain plasma ratio 3.7) in rat. Within the urea series, an excellent D(3) versus D(2) selectivity (>100-fold) could be achieved by removal of one NH group (compound 6), although bioavailability (rat) was suboptimal (F<10%).

The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process. We believe that this is one of the first examples for a Phase III drug candidate that was discovered and optimized, from start to finish, using in silico model-based methods as the primary tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL859039,20200703,9851104|11430856,103488450|103570372,1812|1813|1814|1815|1816,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16722631,0,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The present paper describes the development of this lead to a novel series of non-basic piperidine sulfonamides and amides that have high affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor, whilst maintaining excellent selectivity over off target activities such as the IKr channel.

Chemical optimization of the series led to the identification of a novel and potent alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist 23.

This new compound is an oxygen bioisostere of the potent dopamine D1-selective full agonist dihydrexidine. The initial synthetic approach involved, as a key step, a Suzuki coupling between a chromene triflate and a boronate ester, followed by isoquinoline formation and reduction of the resulting isoquinoline. Subsequently, a more efficient route was developed that involved conjugate addition of an aryl Grignard reagent to a 2-nitrochromene.

This new compound is an oxygen bioisostere of the potent dopamine D1-selective full agonist dihydrexidine. The initial synthetic approach involved, as a key step, a Suzuki coupling between a chromene triflate and a boronate ester, followed by isoquinoline formation and reduction of the resulting isoquinoline. Subsequently, a more efficient route was developed that involved conjugate addition of an aryl Grignard reagent to a 2-nitrochromene.

We describe the structure-activity relationship that lead us to the promising derivative: N-[(2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-7-yloxy)ethyl]-3-(cyclopent-1-enyl)-benzylamine 16. The latter has high affinity for D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, whereas it possesses only a weak affinity for 5-HT2A sites. In cellular models of signal transduction, 16 behaves as a silent antagonist at rD2 receptors while activating h5-HT1A receptors with an efficacy at least equivalent to that of the prototypical 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT. These dual actions confer a unique pharmacological profile to the product. In a behavioral model predictive of positive symptoms, 16 has an activity comparable to that of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, while it is devoid of cataleptogenic effects. Although it produces behaviors characteristic of 5-HT1A receptor activation in rats, these occur at doses 100 times higher than those with (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT. We believe that the relative balance of D2 and 5-HT1A actions in 16 is appropriate, possibly optimal, to ensure superior efficacy and tolerability over existing antipychotic drugs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL910200,20181021,3559|9887537|10248159|16109486,103167216|103506232|103506281|103506323,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17300168,0,,P14416,9606.0,129148.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The different substituents in the 2-, 3-, and 4-positions of the pyridine ring were introduced via an aromatic nucleophilic substitution reaction, a 'halogen-dancing' reaction, and a Grignard coupling of a Boc-protected amino aldehyde, respectively. The synthetic route involves eight steps and provides the mimetic in 20% overall yield. The pyridine based PLG-mimetic was evaluated for its ability to enhance the maximum response of the dopamine agonist N-propylapomorphine (NPA) at human D2 receptors using a cell based assay (the R-SAT assay). The dose-response curve of the mimetic was found to exhibit a down-turn phase, similar to that of PLG. In addition, the mimetic was more potent than PLG to enhance the NPA response; the maximum response was found to be 146% at 10 nM concentration, as compared to 115% for PLG at the same concentration. Interestingly, conformational analysis by molecular modeling showed that the pyridine mimetic cannot adopt a type II beta-turn conformation that previously has been suggested to be the bioactive conformation of PLG.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL919589,20181021,92910|11258646,103312297|103512528,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15588094,0,,P14416,9606.0,566.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

To overcome this limitation, it was hypothesized that an alpha(1a/1d) subtype-selective antagonist would be efficacious while keeping side effects to a minimum. To discover alpha(1a/1d)-selective antagonists and improve metabolic stability of our previously reported compounds, we have designed and synthesized a series of (phenylpiperazinyl)- or (phenylpiperidinyl)-cyclohexylsulfonamides. By incorporating the information obtained from metabolism studies, we were able to discover several compounds that are both alpha(1a/1d) adrenoceptor subtype selective and show increased stability toward human liver microsomal metabolism. The selectivity profile of these compounds provides great improvement over the commercial drug tamsulosin, hence may pave the way to the development of new and efficacious therapeutic agents with reduced side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL900500,20181022,11505007|11519153|11857638|11857709|11857861|11857862|44431560|44433348,103523547|103523549|103523554|103523555|103523562|103523563|103523577|103523578|103523579|103523580|103534102|103534104|103536667|103536668|103536669|103536670,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17904840,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Recent evidence suggests that drugs targeting serotoninergic and muscarinic receptors, and in particular 5-HT(7) antagonists and M(4) agonists, exert beneficial effects in this model of schizophrenia. Compounds that display this combined pattern of activity we refer to as serominic compounds.

Unfortunately, currently marketed alpha(1) blockers produce CV-related side effects that are caused by the subtype non-selective nature of the drugs. To overcome this problem, it was postulated that an alpha(1a/1d) subtype-selective antagonist would bring more benefit for the treatment of BPH/LUTS. As a continuation of our effort to develop selective alpha(1a/1d) ligands, a series of (phenylpiperazinyl)cyclohexylureas was synthesized and evaluated for the ability to bind to three cloned human alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Several trans isomers were shown to have equal affinity for both alpha(1a), and alpha(1d) subtypes, with 14- to 47-fold selectivity versus the alpha(1b) subtype and >15-fold selectivity versus dopamine D(2).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL948052,20181023,16040907|16041090|16041091|16041092|16041263|16041264|16041265|16041449|16041451|16041628|16041629|16041630,103574537|103574538|103574577|103574579|103574621|103574661|103574662|103574702|103574746|103574748|103574794|103574841,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18055202,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

As one of our efforts to discover a new type of 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists, we here report on the synthesis and binding affinities to the 5-HT(7) receptor of the quinazolinone library 1, which was designed with various substituents (X, Y, R(1), and R(2)) on the aromatic rings and different carbon chain length. Total 85 compounds of the quinazolinone library 1 were synthesized and the binding affinities of all the synthesized compounds were obtained by radioligand binding assay for the 5-HT(7) receptor. Among the 85 compounds, 24 compounds show very good binding affinities with IC(50) values below 100 nM. Mainly the compounds with IC(50) values below 100 nM have o-OMe or o-OEt as R(2) substituent.

High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico 'drug repurposing' procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL932736,20181023,1821509,103565497,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606915,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
327994,Confirmatory,Inhibition of dopamine D2 receptor,"Title: (Phenylpiperazinyl-butyl)oxindoles as selective 5-HT7 receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: A series of potent 5-hydroxytryptamine 7 (5-HT 7) ligands has been synthesized that contain a 1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one (oxindole) skeleton. The binding of these compounds to the 5-HT 7 and 5-HT 1A receptors was measured. Despite the structural similarity of these two serotonin receptor subtypes, several derivatives exhibited a high selectivity to the 5-HT 7 receptor. According to the structure-activity relationship observations, compounds unsubstituted at the oxindole nitrogen atom and containing a tetramethylene spacer between the oxindole skeleton and the basic nitrogen atom are the most potent ligands. Concerning the basic group, besides the moieties of the 4-phenylpiperazine type, halophenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines also proved to be 5-HT 7 receptor-ligands. Because of halogen substitution on the aromatic rings, good metabolic stability could be achieved. A representative of the family, 3-{4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-3-ethyl-6-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one ( 9e') exhibited selective 5-HT 7 antagonist activity ( K i = 0.79 nM).

In general, all of the compounds exhibited high binding selectivity at CB1 vs CB2 and the general SAR revealed a lead compound 11-(4-chlorophenyl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine-8-carboxylic acid butylamide (12e) which showed excellent in vivo activity in pharmacodynamic models related to CB1 receptor activity. The low solubility that hampered the development of 12e was solved leading to a potential preclinical candidate 11-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine-8-carboxylic acid butylamide (12h).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1000167,20180910,16049170|42596959|42617993,103652268|103652335|103652395,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19338356,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

We initiated a program to discover orally bioavailable small molecule equivalents of these peptides. A traditional high-throughput screening approach using cAMP activation of the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PPR) as a readout failed to provide any lead compounds. Accordingly, we designed a new screen for this receptor that used a modified N-terminal fragment of PTH as a probe for small molecule binding to the transmembrane region of the PPR, driven by the assumption that the pharmacological properties (agonist/antagonist) of compounds that bound to this putative signaling domain of the PPR could be altered by chemical modification. We developed DPC-AJ1951, a 14 amino acid peptide that acts as a potent agonist of the PPR, and characterized its activity in ex vivo and in vivo assays of bone resorption. In addition, we studied its ability to initiate gene transcription by using microarray technology. Together, these experiments indicated that the highly modified 14 amino acid peptide induces qualitatively similar biological responses to those produced by PTH-(1-34), albeit with lower potency relative to the parent peptide. Encouraged by these data, we performed a screen of a small compound collection by using DPC-AJ1951 as the ligand. These studies led to the identification of the benzoxazepinone SW106, a previously unrecognized small molecule antagonist for the PPR. The binding of SW106 to the PPR was rationalized by using a homology receptor model.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL945447,20181025,16220269,103639246,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17428923,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The results were interpreted within the context of 5-HT 2A receptor models that suggest that members of the DOB-like series can bind to the receptor in two distinct modes that correlate with the compounds' functional activity. Automated ligand docking and molecular dynamics suggest that all of the AMDA derivatives, the parent of which is a 5-HT 2A antagonist, bind in a fashion analogous to that for the sterically demanding antagonist DOB-like compounds. The failure of the F340 (6.52)L mutation to adversely affect the affinity of AMDA and the 3-bromo derivative is consistent with the proposed modes of orientation. Evaluation of ligand-receptor complex models suggest that a valine/threonine exchange between the 5-HT 2A and D 2 receptors may be the origin of selectivity for AMDA and two substituted derivatives.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL994219,20181026,10398175|25139014|25140466,103225569|103292612|103292642,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18847250,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Further exploration of both N-substituted and aryl ring-substituted analogues resulted in the discovery of several high affinity D2R/D3R ligands with 3-benzofurylmethyl-substituents (e.g., 45, K(i)(D2R/D3R) = 1.7:0.34 nM) that induced high affinity not achieved in similarly N-substituted piperidine analogues and significantly (470-fold) improved D3R binding affinity compared to the parent ligand 1.

Initial optimization of high-throughput screening leads afforded a 1,4-substituted piperidine amide 6 with good potency and limited selectivity over hERG and L-type channels and other off-target activities. Further SAR on reducing the basicity of the piperidine and introducing polarity led to the discovery of 3-axial fluoropiperidine 30 with a significantly improved selectivity profile. Compound 30 showed good oral bioavailability and brain penetration across species. In a rat genetic model of absence epilepsy, compound 30 demonstrated a robust reduction in the number and duration of seizures at 33 nM plasma concentration, with no cardiovascular effects at up to 5.6 microM. Compound 30 also showed good efficacy in rodent models of essential tremor and Parkinson's disease. Compound 30 thus demonstrates a wide margin between CNS and peripheral effects and is a useful tool for probing the effects of T-type calcium channel inhibition.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1033936,20181026,16005860,103604318,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18817368,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The affinities for 5-HT 7, 5-HT 1A, and D 2 receptors of compounds 8-31 were assessed, and several compounds displayed 5-HT 7 receptor affinities in the nanomolar range. Among these, N-(4-cyanophenylmethyl)-4-(2-diphenyl)-1-piperazinehexanamide (25) showed high 5-HT 7 receptor affinity (Ki = 0.58 nM), high selectivity over 5-HT 1A and D 2 receptors (324- and 245-fold, respectively), and agonist properties (maximal effect = 82%, EC 50 = 0.60 microM). After intraperitoneal injection in mice, 25 rapidly reached the systemic circulation and entered the brain.

This approach was applied to LY-334370, a selective agonist of 5-HT 1F receptor, to generate structurally well-defined divalent molecules. Radioligand binding assays to three cloned 5-HT 1 receptor subtypes (5-HT 1B, 5-HT 1D, 5-HT 1F) demonstrated that the affinity of a series of homologous dimers varied significantly upon exploration of three structural variables (linker length, attachment position, functionality). In particular, the series of C 3-to-C 3 linked dimers derived from a monomer ( 3) showed high binding affinity to 5-HT 1D (for example, K i approximately 0.3 nM for dimer 8) but did not bind to 5-HT 1F ( K i > 0.01 mM), providing >10000-fold subtype selectivity.

The enantiomers of the most potent racemic compound 10e exhibited differential activity with (-)-10e (K(i); D2=47.5 nM, D3=0.57 nM) displaying higher affinity at both D2 and D3 receptors compared to its enantiomer (+)-10e (K(i); D2=113 nM, D3=3.73 nM). Additionally, compound (-)-10e was more potent and selective for the D3 receptor compared to either 7-OH-DPAT or 5-OH-DPAT. Among the bioisosteric derivatives, the indazole derivative 10g and benzo[b]thiophene derivative 10i exhibited the highest affinity for D2 and D3 receptors.

Historically, many of these drugs have multiple mechanisms of action including calcium and sodium channel blockade as well as GABAergic activity and thus a number of associated side effects. Modulation of the M-current through opening of KCNQ channels has been proposed as a way to attenuate neuroexcitability and have a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of seizure disorders. Therefore, as part of our program to identify new treatments for epilepsy, we set out to identify agonists of KCNQ channels. High throughput screening of our corporate collection led to the identification of 1, adamantane-1-carboxylic acid (3-methyl-3H-benzothiazol-2-ylidine) hydrazide, a potent KCNQ2/Q3 agonist.

The secondary amine 10 represents the central building block for the synthesis of more than 25 tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-1-ols. Generally 7-hydroxy derivatives display higher NR2B receptor affinities than the corresponding 7-benzyloxy compounds. A distance of four atoms (five bond lengths) between the basic amino group and the terminal aryl moiety led to highest NR2B affinity. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (WMS-1410, 25) represents the most promising NR2B antagonist of this series showing a K(i)-value of 14nM. Compound 25 reveals excellent selectivity over more than 100 further relevant target proteins, antagonizes glutamate induced excitotoxicity (IC(50)=18.4nM) and is metabolically more stable than ifenprodil.

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640621,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

It has been proposed that the liability to exhibit side effects such as extra pyramidal symptoms may be the result of a slow rate of dissociation. Compounds with a faster rate of dissociation, while still blocking efficiently the D(2) receptors, will subsequently respond better to physiological surges in dopamine transmission. Therefore, work in our laboratories has focussed on identifying fast dissociating and selective D(2) antagonists. Biological screening was performed to measure the affinity and extent of dissociation for a large dataset of over 1800 D(2) antagonists. Subsequent univariate and multivariate statistical analysis revealed the molecular properties which differentiate fast and slow dissociating compounds.

In this series, we discovered some of the most D3R selective compounds reported to date (e.g., 8d and 8j, >1000-fold D3R-selective over D2R). In addition, chimeric receptor studies further identified the second extracellular (E2) loop as an important contributor to D3R binding selectivity. Further, compounds lacking the carbonyl group in the amide linker were synthesized, and while these amine-linked analogues bound with similar affinities to the amides at D2R, this modification dramatically reduced binding affinities at D3R by >100-fold (e.g., D3R K(i) for 15b = 393 vs for 8j = 2.6 nM), resulting in compounds with significantly reduced D3R selectivity.

A highly attractive approach to investigate and control GPCR dimerization may be provided by the exploration and characterization of bivalent ligands, which can act as molecular probes simultaneously binding two adjacent binding sites of a dimer. The synthesis of bivalent dopamine D(2) receptor ligands of type 1 is presented, incorporating the privileged structure of 1,4-disubstituted aromatic piperidines/piperazines (1,4-DAPs) and triazolyl-linked spacer elements. Radioligand binding studies provided diagnostic insights when Hill slopes close to two for bivalent ligands with particular spacer lengths and a comparative analysis with respective monovalent control ligands and unsymmetrically substituted analogues indicated a bivalent binding mode with a simultaneous occupancy of two neighboring binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1803215,20180919,53361301|53361302,134444160|134455731,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21599022,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

The human 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor has been implicated in several neurological conditions, and potent selective 5-HT(2A/2C) ligands may have therapeutic potential for treatment of CNS diseases such as depression. An imidazole moiety usually provides good pharmacokinetic properties as a drug substance, and thus considerable efforts have been devoted to develop imidazole derivatives into drug candidates. The imidazole series of compounds was evaluated against 5-HT(2A/2C) and serotonin reuptake inhibition.

We set out to discover novel, neutral 5-HT(6)R antagonists to improve off-target selectivity compared to basic amine-containing scaffolds dominating the field. High-throughput screening identified the N'-(sulfonyl)pyrazoline-1-carboxamidine scaffold as a promising neutral core for starting hit-to-lead. Medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, small molecule NMR and X-ray crystallography were subsequently applied to optimize the leads into antagonists (compounds 1-49) displaying high 5-HT(6)R affinity with optimal off-target selectivity. Unique structural features include a pseudoaromatic system and an internal hydrogen bond freezing the bioactive conformation. While physicochemical properties and CNS availability were generally favorable, significant efforts had to be made to improve metabolic stability. The optimized structure 42 is an extremely selective, hERG-free, high-affinity 5-HT(6)R antagonist showing good human in vitro metabolic stability.

The molecule conformational flexibility in the series is restricted by formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between 3-sulfo and 2-methylamino groups, which renders high potency and high selectivity to block serotonin-induced responses in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human 5-HT(6)R. In this work, we tested the hypothesis if addition of a positively ionizable group (PI) to the pyrimidine ring of the scaffold members in positions 5, 6, or 7 could further increase their 5HT(6)R blocking potency. We show that the presence of the PI group with small substituents does not substantially affect either potency or selectivity of the ligands while causing substantial changes in their cLogP values. This provides a possibility for designing of the 5HT(6)R ligands with modified ADME characteristics without grossly affecting efficiency of their interaction with the receptor. In respect to the structure-activity relationship (SAR), among other physiochemical parameters, only the molecule size and shape (described by gyration radii) showed a clear tendency for more compact molecules to be more potent antagonists of this receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1925005,20180920,56655504,136939345,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22029285,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Current drugs primarily target dopamine D2 receptors and are only effective in the treatment of the positive symptoms of this indication. The tetrahydroprotoberberine natural product (±)-govadine has shown unique promise for the treatment of both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as it targets both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors. However, further clinical research has been hindered by the lack of availability of significant quantities of enantioenriched material. A new, enantioselective synthetic route has been developed that affords (-)-govadine in 39% overall yield over 5-steps from commercially available dopamine and homovanillic acid derivatives. Using only minor modifications in the synthetic route, (+)-govadine can be synthesized in comparable yields and enantioselectivities. The route is readily scalable as every intermediate was purified by crystallization and no flash column chromatography was necessary.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1954434,20200626,56968583|57401392,136922064|136941593,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22284818,0,,P14416,,,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects. These novel chemical entities could potentially be advanced to the clinic as new drug candidates for treating depression.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026364,20200626,45254040|56951368|56951495,160678244|160688954|160705128,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22171543,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Additionally, the targeted library members were tested for 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(6), and D(2) receptors. Selected compounds of particular interest were examined for their intrinsic activity at 5-HT(7)R in vitro employing a cAMP assay. The study allowed us to identify compound 68 (4-fluoro-N-(1-{2-[(propan-2-yl)phenoxy]ethyl}piperidin-4-yl) benzenesulfonamide) as a potent 5-HT(7)R ligand (K(i) = 0.3 nM) with strong antagonistic properties (K(b) = 1 nM) and a 1450-fold selectivity over 5-HT(1A)Rs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2162846,20200625,55479093|71449641|71449642|71449643|71449644|71449645|71451454|71451455|71451456|71451457|71451458|71451459|71451460|71453278|71453279|71453280|71453281|71453282|71454997|71454998|71454999|71455000|71455001|71455002|71456780|71456781|71456782|71456783|71456784|71458647|71458648|71458649|71458650|71458651|71458652|71460468|71462178|71462179|135398737|135398745,103165765|103195217|163313576|163313577|163313578|163313579|163313580|163317000|163317001|163317002|163317003|163317004|163317005|163317006|163320474|163320475|163320476|163320477|163320478|163323866|163323867|163323868|163323869|163323870|163323871|163327315|163327316|163327317|163327318|163327319|163327320|163330808|163330809|163330810|163330811|163330812|163330813|163334316|163337733|163337734,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22926225,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We developed a facile method that utilizes Suzuki coupling for easy incorporations of various substituted pendant rings into the scaffold. A small focused library of octahydrobenzo[f]quinolines 5 was synthesized, and these compounds demonstrated at least 14-fold D(2)-like selectivity over D(1) in native porcine striatal tissue. Furthermore, n-propyl analog 5f was found to be a high affinity (K(i)=1.1 nM) D(3) dopamine full agonist with 145-fold selectivity over the D(2) receptor and about 840-fold selectivity over the D(1) receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2162509,20200625,2726|11957566|46869265|71451380|71454926|71462089,103169389|104245311|123094695|163316883|163323767|163337621,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23018094,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Functional potency of 11d and 14b indicated a 24- and 94-fold increase in potency at the D2 receptor compared to 5-OH-DPAT (EC50; 1.7 and 0.44 vs. 41 nM for 11d and 14b vs. 5-OH-DPAT, respectively). These are the most potent bivalent agonists for D2 receptor known to date.

Starting from 2-benzyl-imidazoline screening hits, a series of structurally related 2-benzyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazoles was investigated first, but it proved highly challenging to obtain compounds having sufficient selectivity against the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor. This issue could be successfully addressed by modification of the linker region and SAR exploration led to the discovery of highly selective isopropyl-substituted 4-aminomethyl-imidazole compounds. The work culminated in the identification of the selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5073012 (4-chlorophenyl)-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-isopropyl-amine, 24), which has a good pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration in rodents.

Thirty-one THPB derivatives with diverse substituents on A and D ring were synthesized, and their binding affinity to dopamine D(1), D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were determined. Compounds 18k and 18m were identified as partial agonists at the D(1) receptor with K(i) values of 50 and 6.3nM, while both compounds act as D(2) receptor antagonists (K(i)=305 and 145nM, respectively) and 5-HT(1A) receptor full agonists (K(i)=149 and 908nM, respectively). These two THPBs compounds exerted antipsychotic actions in animal models.

Thirty-one THPB derivatives with diverse substituents on A and D ring were synthesized, and their binding affinity to dopamine D(1), D(2) and serotonin 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A) receptors were determined. Compounds 18k and 18m were identified as partial agonists at the D(1) receptor with K(i) values of 50 and 6.3nM, while both compounds act as D(2) receptor antagonists (K(i)=305 and 145nM, respectively) and 5-HT(1A) receptor full agonists (K(i)=149 and 908nM, respectively). These two THPBs compounds exerted antipsychotic actions in animal models.

Part 1._||_Abstract: A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated. The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and ESI-HRMS spectra data. All tested compounds proved to be potent 5-HT1A receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) ligands. Among them, compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for 5-HT1A and SERT. Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15, 31 and 32 to models of 5-HT1A receptor and SERT confirm the results of biological tests. Due to high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and moderate affinity for SERT, compounds 31, 32, 35, and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors. In vivo tests, in turn, resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 to the 5-HT1A receptor.

The major drawback of C-11 tracers is the lack of cyclotron facility in many health care centers thereby limiting widespread clinical or research use. We identified the fluoroethyl derivative, 2-(4-(4-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione (FECUMI-101) (Ki=0.1nM; Emax=77%; EC50=0.65nM) as a partial agonist 5-HT1AR ligand of the parent ligand CUMI-101. FECUMI-101 is radiolabeled with F-18 by O-fluoroethylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue (1) with [(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate in DMSO in the presence of 1.6equiv of K2CO3 in 45±5% yield (EOS). PET shows [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binds specifically to 5-HT1AR enriched brain regions of baboon. The specificity of [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binding to 5-HT1AR was confirmed by challenge studies with the known 5-HT1AR ligand WAY100635. These findings indicate that [(18)F]FECUMI-101 can be a viable agonist ligand for the in vivo quantification of high affinity 5-HT1AR with PET.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2416736,20200629,21830793|73346042,174487458|174487459,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23816046,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Recently, clinical proof-of-concept was achieved for the treatment of primary insomnia using dual (OX1R/OX2R) orexin receptor antagonists. However, elucidation of the pharmacology associated with selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists (2-SORAs) has been hampered by the lack of orally bioavailable, highly selective small molecule probes. Herein, the discovery and optimization of a novel series of 2,5-diarylnicotinamides as potent and orally bioavailable orexin-2 receptor selective antagonists is described.

The replacement of the H-7 in the tetrahydronaphthalene system by an amino group resulted in privileged 5-HT(2A) affinity of the 6-fluorobenzo[d]isoxazol derivative 36 and the alcohol 25 both showing a pK(i) value for 5-HT(2A) higher than 8.3 and good binding affinities for D₂ receptor leading to a Meltzer's ratio characteristic of an atypical antipsychotic profile. Additionally, a small collection of 3-aminomethyltetralone derivatives was prepared and examined here for their affinities and selectivities as 5-HT(2A)/D₂ dual ligands. Compound 11 shows the best profile with good pKi values for 5-HT(2A) and D₂ receptors leading to a Meltzer's ratio characteristic of a typical antipsychotic behaviour.

For many decades, natural product research has been a very active field of research in Mexico, and there also are some ongoing ethnopharmacological research efforts. This review provides an overview and critical appraisal on some key developments in these fields and examples of medicinal plants used by indigenous communities that have become of great local importance in Mexican popular medicine. In this review, the focus is on plants with effects on the CNS, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory processes, and gastrointestinal disorders. While some of the major food plants consumed worldwide originate from southern North America, only very few medicinal plants have become of major global importance. Opuntia species are now used increasingly to manage diabetes and metabolic syndrome and represent an example of a novel medicinal product/supplement. Undoubtedly, narcotic and mind-altering drugs both have received the widest scientific interest and have attracted considerable popular attention. The history of use of the indigenous Mexican Materia Medica in the context of research on local and popular resources specifically with regard to the diverse challenges in the context of studying the world's biodiversity and the development of comparative and semiquantitative ethnobotanical research methods is discussed herein. Natural product and ethnopharmacological research in Mexico seems to have been influenced by the political and societal developments originating from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and subsequent conventions, which have not yet had the desired effect of giving value to these local resources, as they might deserve. Their equitable and sustainable implementation remains a challenge. Natural product research and ethnopharmacology will play a key role in developing an adequate evidence base for such products derived from local and traditional knowledge in Mexico.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3131489,20180929,91588,194154860,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24559070,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

Many scaffold modifications were largely tolerated, resulting in nanomolar-potent compounds in the H3R functional assay. Exemplar compound 6s demonstrated a selective profile against a panel of 144 secondary pharmacological receptors, with activity at only σ2 (62% at 10 μM).

At three doses tested in the mouse novel object recognition model (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg s.c.), 6s demonstrated a statistically significant response compared with the control group.

However, clinically approved drugs targeting D2 DAR display poor selectivity between the D2 and other receptors, especially the D3 DAR. This lack of selectivity may lead to undesirable side effects. Here we describe the chemical and pharmacological characterization of a novel D2 DAR antagonist series with excellent D2 versus D1, D3, D4, and D5 receptor selectivity. The final probe 65 was obtained through a quantitative high-throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, to yield a selective molecule with good in vitro physical properties, metabolic stability, and in vivo pharmacokinetics. The optimized molecule may be a useful in vivo probe for studying D2 DAR signal modulation and could also serve as a lead compound for the development of D2 DAR-selective druglike molecules for the treatment of multiple neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3239709,20181002,3559|133633|16007814|16058752|46912547|57377246|57383397|57383401|57383405|57383408|57383414|57383430|57383431|57383434|57383436,103167216|103247487|242111085|242303585|242621003|242621291|242621305|242621306|242621307|242621308|242621310|242621311|242621312|242621313|242621314,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24666157,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Although recent evidence indicates that the σ2 receptor binding site is localized within the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), most information regarding this protein has been obtained using either radiolabeled or fluorescent receptor-based probes and from biochemical analysis of the effect of σ2 selective ligands on cells grown in culture.

EBI2 is highly expressed in immune cells ( J. Biol. Chem. 2006 , 281 , 13199 ), and its activation has been shown to be critical for the adaptive immune response and has been genetically linked to autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes ( Nature 2010 , 467 , 460 ). Here we describe the isolation of a potent small molecule antagonist for the EBI2 receptor. First, we identified a small molecule agonist NIBR51 (1), which enabled identification of inhibitors of receptor activation. One antagonist called NIBR127 (2) was used as a starting point for a medicinal chemistry campaign, which yielded NIBR189 (4m). This compound was extensively characterized in binding and various functional signaling assays. Furthermore, we have used 4m to block migration of a monocyte cell line called U937, suggesting a functional role of the oxysterol/EBI2 pathway in these immune cells.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3266168,20181003,36295259,242636124,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24678947,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Although they were affected by conjugation, the binding affinities were found to be still in the nanomolar range (between 1.5 and 64.2 nM). In addition, homology modeling of the receptor and docking studies for the most potent compounds were performed, elucidating the binding modes of the fusion molecules and the structure elements contributing to the observed high receptor binding. Furthermore, no interaction between the hybrid compounds and P-gp, the main excretory transporter of the BBB, was found.

Heterocyclic dopamine surrogates comprising a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine moiety were synthesized and investigated for their binding properties when low- to subnanomolar K(i) values were determined for D(2L), D(2S), and D3 receptors. Measurement of [(35)S]GTPγS incorporation at D(2S) coexpressed with G-protein subunits indicated significant bias for promotion of Gα(o1) over Gα(i2) coupling for several test compounds.

( R )-BAK2-66 showed higher D3R affinity and selectivity than its (S)-enantiomer; however, it had lower D3R affinity and enantioselectivity than ( R )-PG648. Further, importance of the 4-atom linker length between the aryl amide and 4-phenylpiperazine was demonstrated with the 4-fluorobutyl-product (8).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3291797,20181004,25141534|42626240|42626318|53248209|90644928|90644929|90644930,124961101|124966353|124969027|131282861|242646060|242646061|242646062,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24944737,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Upon screening several compounds, N-(diaminomethylene)-4',5'-dihydro-3'H-spiro[fluorene-9,2'-furan]-2-carboxamide (17) exhibited potent affinity for both 5-HT(2B) (Ki = 5.1 nM) and 5-HT(7) (K(i) = 1.7 nM) receptors with high selectivity over 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2C), α(1), D(2) and M(1) receptors.

The potential atypical antipsychotic 5bb was selected for further pharmacological investigation. The distribution of c-fos positive cells in the ventral striatum confirmed the atypical antipsychotic profile of 5bb in agreement with behavioral rodent studies. 5bb administered orally demonstrated a biphasic effect on the MK801-induced hyperactivity at dose levels not able to induce sedation, catalepsy, or learning impairment in passive avoidance.

Radioligand binding studies provided diagnostic insights when Hill slopes close to two for the bivalent ligand 13 incorporating 22 spacer atoms and a comparative analysis with monovalent control ligands indicated a bivalent binding mode with a simultaneous occupancy of two neighboring binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3369122,20181006,3559|52919|13869641|21559988|23364995|118709159|118709160|118709161|118709162|118709163|118709164|118709165|118709166|118709167|118709168|118709169|118709170|118709171|118709172|118709173|118709174|118709175|118709176|118709177|118709178|118709179,103167216|103770969|312350859|312350860|312350861|312350862|312350863|312350864|312350865|312350866|312350867|312350868|312350869|312350870|312350871|312350872|312350873|312350874|312350875|312350876|312350877|312350878|312350879|312350880|312350881|312350882,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25047579,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Analogues were selected for synthesis using a lipophilicity based hypothesis to achieve the targeted rapid onset of action in combination with a long duration of action. The profiling of the two series led to identification of the α-substituted cyclopentyl analogue 2 as the optimal compound with a comparable profile to the inhaled once-daily long-acting β2-adrenoceptor agonist indacaterol.

These molecules are potentially able to interact at two orthosteric binding sites of a heterodimer simultaneously, possibly resulting in enhanced subtype selectivity, higher affinity, enhanced or modified physiological response, and reduced reliance on multiple drug administration regimens.

These molecules are potentially able to interact at two orthosteric binding sites of a heterodimer simultaneously, possibly resulting in enhanced subtype selectivity, higher affinity, enhanced or modified physiological response, and reduced reliance on multiple drug administration regimens. In this study, we have successfully synthesized a series of classical heterobivalent ligands as well as a series of more integrated and 'drug-like' dual acting molecules, incorporating ropinirole as a dopamine D2 receptor agonist and ZM 241385 as an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist.

A common molecular template used in the development of D3R-selective antagonists and partial agonists incorporates a butylamide linker between two pharmacophores, a phenylpiperazine moiety and an extended aryl ring system. The series of compounds described herein incorporates a change to that chemical template, replacing the amide functional group in the linker chain with a 1,2,3-triazole group. Although the amide linker in the 4-phenylpiperazine class of D3R ligands has been previously deemed critical for high D3R affinity and selectivity, the 1,2,3-triazole moiety serves as a suitable bioisosteric replacement and maintains desired D3R-binding functionality of the compounds. Additionally, using mouse liver microsomes to evaluate CYP450-mediated phase I metabolism, we determined that novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing compounds modestly improves metabolic stability compared to amide-containing analogues. The 1,2,3-triazole moiety allows for the modular attachment of chemical subunit libraries using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry, increasing the range of chemical entities that can be designed, synthesized, and developed toward D3R-selective therapeutic agents.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3591124,20181008,25141534|72190766|118719792|122180568|122180569|122180570|122180571|122180572|122180573|122180574|122180575|122180576|122180610|122180611|122180612|122180613|122180614|122180615|122180616|122180617|122180618|122180619|122180620|122180621|122180622|122180623|122180624|122180625|122180626|122180627|122181005|122181006|122181007,124966353|174493497|312367617|318375884|318375885|318375886|318375887|318375888|318375889|318375890|318375891|318375892|318375953|318375954|318375955|318375956|318375957|318375958|318375959|318375960|318375961|318375962|318375963|318375964|318375965|318375966|318375967|318375968|318375969|318375970|318376629|318376630|318376631,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25650314,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

This highly potent molecular scaffold was developed from an inactive diarylpyridine-2-amine derivative 3b by extensive and systematic analogue synthesis and SAR analysis. Further optimization of the scaffold resulted in identification of pyridin-2(1H)-one 18b as a lead compound with good potency (IC50 = 1.6 nM) and selectivity (>6000-fold) over other related PDEs but with a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Careful metabolite profiling of 18b revealed that poor systemic exposure in rats (Cmax = 44 ng/mL; AUC0-t = 359 ng · h/mL) at 10 mg/kg was due to the formation of O-glucuronide conjugate by phase 2 metabolism. The structure of the glucuronide metabolite was confirmed by retention time and LC-MS/MS fragmentation matching with the synthetic glucuronide 26. The problem of low exposure of 18b was effectively addressed by its conversion to an acetate prodrug 25b, which upon oral dosing resulted in an improved pharmacokinetic profile (Cmax = 359 ng.h/mL; AUC0-t = 2436 ng.h/mL) and a desirable brain to plasma ratio of 1.2. The prodrug 25b showed good efficacy in selected rodent models of psychosis.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3637051,20200702,122196341,318397836,1812|1813|1814|1815|1816,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26421921,0,,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Molecular modeling, synthesis and biological evaluation._||_Abstract: A series of novel arylpiperazine 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-methylhydantoins with 2-hydroxypropyl linker (2-15) was synthesized and evaluated on their affinity towards serotonin 5-HT7 receptor (5-HT7R) in comparison to other closely related GPCRs: serotonin 5-HT1A, and dopamine D2 receptors. The functional activity studied through the measurement of 5-HT7R-mediated cyclic AMP production in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK293) stably expressing human 5-HT7 proved their antagonistic properties. The lead structure was also examined in the preliminary metabolic stability study using human liver microsomes (HMLs). The process of selection of candidates for synthesis was supported by a special molecular modeling workflow including combinatorial library generation, docking, and machine learning-based assessment. Additionally, in silico predictions of selectivity over 5-HT1AR and D2R, as well as functional activity were carried out. The newly synthesized compounds were proved to possess a potent affinity for 5-HT7R, similar to that of the lead structure of 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(3-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-hydroxypropyl)-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (1).

The atypical DAT inhibitors have received attention due to their promising pharmacological profiles in animal models of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse. Herein, we report a series of modafinil analogues that have an atypical DAT inhibitor profile. We extended SAR by chemically manipulating the oxidation states of the sulfoxide and the amide functional groups, halogenating the phenyl rings, and/or functionalizing the terminal nitrogen with substituted piperazines, resulting in several novel leads such as 11b, which demonstrated high DAT affinity (Ki = 2.5 nM) and selectivity without producing concomitant locomotor stimulation in mice, as compared to cocaine. These results are consistent with an atypical DAT inhibitor profile and suggest that 11b may be a potential lead for development as a psychostimulant abuse medication.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3863997,20180907,57267|9690109|10430935|16759249|90389439|90389592|118643968,103168004|103172864|103771175|194181802|374294006|374298297|374309215,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27933960,0,,P14416,9606.0,54.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

In vitro evaluation allowed to identify compound 17 (2-ethyl-3-(3-fluorobenzyl)-7-(piperazin-1-yl)-3H-imidazo[4,5-b]pyridine) as potent 5-HT6 receptor partial inverse agonist in Gs signaling (Ki = 6 nM, IC50 = 17.6 nM). Compound 17 displayed high metabolic stability, favorable cytochrome P450 isoenzyme (2D6, 3A4) profile, did not affect PgP-protein binding, without evoking mutagenic effects. It was orally bioavailable and brain penetrant. In contrast to intepirdine (SB-742457), which prevented 5-HT6R-elicited neurite growth and behaved as an inverse agonist of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), compound 17 has no influence on neuronal differentiation. Compound 17 exerted significant pro-cognitive properties in novel object recognition (NOR) task in rats reversing both phencyclidine- and scopolamine-induced memory deficits (MED = 1 and 0.3 mg/kg, p.o, respectively). These effects were similar to those produced by intepirdine. Additionally, combination of inactive doses of compound 17 (0.1 mg/kg) and donepezil (0.3 mg/kg) produced synergistic effect to reverse scopolamine-induced memory deficits. Accordingly, investigating putative divergence between inverse agonists and neutral antagonists as cognitive enhancers in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders is certainly of utmost interest.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4146376,20200618,11256720|126720394|126720403|126720425|126720440,103756096|404659390|404665410|404665916|404688337,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29291439,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

We have explored the structure-activity relationship of a 3-(4-phenyl-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5-(aryl)benzoic acid antagonist scaffold, assisted by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a P2Y14R homology model. A computational pipeline using the High Throughput MD Python environment guided the analogue design. Selection of candidates was based upon ligand-protein shape and complementarity and the persistence of ligand-protein interactions over time. Predictions of a favorable substitution of a 5-phenyl group with thiophene and an insertion of a three-methylene spacer between the 5-aromatic and alkyl amino moieties were largely consistent with empirical results. The substitution of a key carboxylate group on the core phenyl ring with tetrazole or truncation of the 5-aryl group reduced affinity. The most potent antagonists, using a fluorescent assay, were a primary 3-aminopropyl congener 20 (MRS4458) and phenyl p-carboxamide 30 (MRS4478).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4189962,20200618,126720252,404686172,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767967,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

All known D1-selective agonists are catecholamines that bring about receptor desensitization and undergo rapid metabolism, thus limiting their utility as a therapeutic for chronic illness such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our high-throughput screening efforts on D1 yielded a single non-catecholamine hit PF-4211 (6) that was developed into a series of potent D1 receptor agonist leads with high oral bioavailability and CNS penetration. An important structural feature of this series is the locked biaryl ring system resulting in atropisomerism. Disclosed herein is a summary of our hit-to-lead efforts on this series of D1 activators culminating in the discovery of atropisomer 31 (PF-06256142), a potent and selective orthosteric agonist of the D1 receptor that has reduced receptor desensitization relative to dopamine and other catechol-containing agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4260966,20200619,75201901,404702213,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30431269,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

Compound 33 was selected for PK studies because it displayed balanced affinities for the main targets and clear selectivity over the two off-targets. 33 has good stability and oral bioavailability and can cross the blood-brain barrier.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4008741,20200620,85469680|85470564|90466425|90466573|90466574|90466717|90466867|90467020|90467021|90467024|90467322|90467323|90467453|137652174|137658100|137661635,381836682|381837994|381846551|381847377|381849031|381849140|381856892|381860357|381867413|381869329|381871755|381873307|381879388|381881340|381883801|381886892,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28182408,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

The ability to bind two distinct receptor binding sites simultaneously can allow the selective activation of specific G-protein dependent or β-arrestin-mediated cascade pathways.

To rationalize the experimental observations and derive information about receptor-ligand interactions of the reported ligands, docking studies, using 5-HT1A and α1d-AR models generated by homology techniques, and a retrospective computational study were performed. The results highlighted that proper substituents in position 2 of the phenoxy moiety of 3 selectively address the ligands toward 5-HT1A receptor with respect to α1-ARs and D2-like receptor subtypes. Methoxymethylenoxy derivative 9 showed the best 5-HT1A selectivity profile and the highest potency at 5-HT1A receptor, behaving as a partial agonist. Finally, 9, tested in light/dark exploration test in mice, significantly reduced anxiety-linked behaviors. Therefore, it may be considered a lead for the design of partial agonists potentially useful in the treatment of disorders in which 5-HT1A receptor is involved.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041731,20200621,25131876|137639125|137646245,164136250|381848133|381858648,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27662034,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models. The compounds did not inhibit the structurally related fungal enzyme sterol Δ8,7-isomerase, but showed inhibition of diverse enzymes in late cholesterol biosynthesis at high concentrations. In a screening against more than 50 target proteins, (2S)-1-benzyl-4-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,4-diazepane ((S)-28b, Ki(σ1)=0.86nM) showed a clean receptor profile. The dose dependent potentiation of electrically stimulated contractions of guinea pig vas deferens indicates σ1 agonistic activity of (S)-28b. Even at a dose of 100mg/kg (S)-28b did not induce severe toxic or behavioral effects in the Irwin screen.

To better understand the structural features required for the selective interaction with the D4R and to obtain compounds unable to activate mAChRs, the aliphatic butyl chain and the piperidine nucleus of 1 were modified, affording compounds 2-14. The 4-benzylpiperidine 9 and the 4-phenylpiperazine 12 showed high D4R affinity and selectivity not only over the other D2-like subtypes, but also over M1-M5 mAChRs. Derivative 12 was also highly selective over some selected off-targets. This compound showed biased behavior, potently and partially activating Gi protein and inhibiting β-arrestin2 recruitment in functional studies. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that it was characterized by a relevant brain penetration. Therefore, 12 might be a useful tool to better clarify the role played by D4R in disorders in which this subtype is involved.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4048883,20200622,5311200|10236758|14925759|118719925|118719926|118719927|137635734|137636308|137640201|137640511|137642607|137644962|137645938|137655636|137661377,103165750|312367788|312367795|312367796|312367797|381843094|381843916|381849708|381850208|381853300|381856133|381856754|381858210|381872580|381886515,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29589445,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
1483562,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]-N-methylspiperone from human dopamine D2 receptor expressed in HEK293 cells after 1 hr by MicroBeta microplate counting method,"Title: Toward Understanding the Structural Basis of Partial Agonism at the Dopamine D3 Receptor._||_Abstract: Both dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) partial agonists and antagonists have been implicated as potential medications for substance use disorders. In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations.

Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation._||_Abstract: A series of 1- and 2-naphthyloxy derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for histamine H3 receptor affinity. Most compounds showed high affinities with Ki values below 100 nM. The most potent ligand, 1-(5-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)pentyl)azepane (11) displayed high affinity for the histamine H3 receptor with a Ki value of 21.9 nM. The antagonist behaviour of 11 was confirmed both in vitro in the cAMP assay (IC50 = 312 nM) and in vivo in the rat dipsogenia model (ED50 = 3.68 nM). Moreover, compound 11 showed positive effects on scopolamine induced-memory deficits in mice (at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg) and an analgesic effect in the formalin test in mice with ED50 = 30.6 mg/kg (early phase) and ED50 = 20.8 mg/kg (late phase). Another interesting compound, 1-(5-(Naphthalen-1-yloxy)pentyl)piperidine (13; H3R Ki = 53.9 nM), was accepted for Anticonvulsant Screening Program at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institute of Health (Rockville, USA). The screening was performed in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) and the 6-Hz psychomotor animal models of epilepsy. Neurologic deficit was evaluated by the rotarod test. Compound 13 inhibited convulsions induced by the MES with ED50 of 19.2 mg/kg (mice, i.p.), 17.8 (rats, i.p.), and 78.1 (rats, p.o.). Moreover, 13 displayed protection against the 6-Hz psychomotor seizures (32 mA) in mice (i.p.) with ED50 of 33.1 mg/kg and (44 mA) ED50 of 57.2 mg/kg. Furthermore, compounds 11 and 13 showed in vitro weak influence on viability of tested cell lines (normal HEK293, neuroblastoma IMR-32, hepatoma HEPG2), weak inhibition of CYP3A4 activity, and no mutagenicity.

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

Restoration of the diminished 5-HT2CR signaling through positive allosteric modulation presents a novel therapeutic approach. Several new molecules with the 4-alkylpiperidine-2-carboxamide scaffold were designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically evaluated, leading to the discovery of selective 5-HT2CR positive allosteric modulators (PAMs).

A topographically distinct allosteric site was identified based on the newly solved 5-HT2CR structure. Compound 16 modulated 5-HT2CR-mediated spontaneous ambulation, partially substituted for the training dose of the 5-HT2CR agonist WAY163909, synergized with a low dose of WAY163909 to substitute fully for the stimulus effects of WAY163909, and attenuated relapse vulnerability as assessed in a rodent self-administration model, indicating its therapeutic promise for CUD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4309152,20210302,71575525,440129674,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29620897,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Using synthetic peptides with amino acid sequences of transmembrane (TM) domains of D<sub>2</sub>R, we provide evidence that TM6 forms the interface of the homodimer. Notably, the disturber peptide TAT-TM6 decreased the binding of bivalent ligand 13 by 52-fold and had no effect on monovalent compound 15, confirming the D<sub>2</sub>R homodimer through TM6 ex vivo. In conclusion, by using a versatile multivalent chemical platform, we have developed a precise strategy to generate a true bivalent ligand that simultaneously targets both orthosteric sites of the D<sub>2</sub>R homodimer.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4310167,20210302,155539653|155549497,440155299|440179355,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30257092,0,,P14416,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

Thus, hLH-R represents a valid target for the treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers and diseases (polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, endometriosis) as well as contraception. Screening of the Bayer compound library led to the discovery of tetrahydrothienopyridine derivatives as novel, small-molecule (SMOL) hLH-R inhibitors and to the development of BAY-298, the first nanomolar hLH-R antagonist reducing sex hormone levels in vivo. Further optimization of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters led to the identification of BAY-899 with an improved in vitro profile and proven efficacy in vivo. BAY-298 and BAY-899 serve as valuable tool compounds to study hLH-R signaling in vitro and to interfere with the production of sex hormones in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4323845,20210302,139600336|139600337,440134679|440177903,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31670515,0,,P14416,9606.0,198.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,0

To address these issues, we identified LY3154207 (<b>3</b>) as a novel, potent, and subtype selective human D1 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) with minimal allosteric agonist activity. Conformational studies showed LY3154207 adopts an unusual boat conformation, and a binding pose with the human D1 receptor was proposed based on this observation. In contrast to orthosteric agonists, LY3154207 showed a distinct pharmacological profile without a bell-shaped dose-response relationship or tachyphylaxis in preclinical models. Identification of a crystalline form of free LY3154207 from the discovery lots was not successful. Instead, a novel cocrystal form with superior solubility was discovered and determined to be suitable for development. This cocrystal form was advanced to clinical development as a potential first-in-class D1 PAM and is now in phase 2 studies for Lewy body dementia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4337853,20210302,86290953,312390722,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31532644,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The dopamine precursor L-DOPA, the most commonly used therapeutic agent for Parkinson's disease, can restore normal movement yet cause side-effects such as dyskinesias upon prolonged administration. Dopamine D1 and D2 receptors activate G-protein- and arrestin-dependent signaling pathways that regulate various dopamine-dependent functions including locomotion.

This hypothesis has been tested using a benchmark series of 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonists obtained by coupling variously substituted 2-aminoimidazole moieties to the well established 1-benzenesulfonyl-1H-indoles, which served as the ligands cores. The crystallographic studies revealed that upon protonation, the 2-aminoimidazole fragment triggers a resonance driven conformational change leading to a form of higher affinity. This molecular switch may be responsible for the observed differences in 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R activity of the studied chemotypes with different amine-like fragments. Considering the multiple functionalization sites of the embedded guanidine fragment, diverse libraries were constructed, and the relationships between the structure and activity, metabolic stability, and solubility were established. Compounds from the N-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)acylamide chemotype (10a-z) exhibited high affinity for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R and very high selectivity over 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors (negligible binding), which was attributed to their very weak basicity. The lead compound in the series 4-methyl-5-[1-(naphthalene-1-sulfonyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-1H-imidazol-2-amine (9i) was shown to reverse the cognitive impairment caused by the administration of scopolamine in rats indicating procognitive potential.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4354013,20210302,60854|155510927|155514459|155514575|155515415|155515919|155518159|155521503|155522116|155522487|155522920|155523121|155524884|155526468|155528355|155530285|155531362|155531455|155532396|155532545|155532983|155533573|155533660|155534040|155534152|155534794|155535878|155537227|155538716|155538873|155540721|155540795|155541547|155541676|155542237|155542461|155545526|155548275|155549153|155552641|155555525|155556756|155557500|155560922|155560942|155561865|155562423|155563164|155563826|155566665|155566854|155568299|155569337,103194712|440110412|440115706|440115885|440117166|440117925|440121264|440126562|440127478|440128056|440128752|440129077|440131721|440134172|440137081|440140027|440141621|440141767|440143191|440143440|440144099|440144981|440145113|440145671|440145814|440146804|440148526|440150596|440152923|440153354|440157579|440157712|440159513|440159840|440161204|440161756|440169471|440176336|440178457|440187226|440194665|440197577|440199426|440208115|440208178|440210504|440212008|440213783|440215418|440222684|440223156|440226861|440229383,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31229883,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Previous work has exemplified the use of bitopic ligands as a powerful strategy in achieving subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists alike. Inspired by the potential for chemical modification of the D3 preferential agonists (+)-PD128,907 (1) and PF592,379 (2), we synthesized bitopic structures to further improve their D3R selectivity.

Previous work has exemplified the use of bitopic ligands as a powerful strategy in achieving subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists alike. Inspired by the potential for chemical modification of the D3 preferential agonists (+)-PD128,907 (1) and PF592,379 (2), we synthesized bitopic structures to further improve their D3R selectivity.

The studies are focused on design, synthesis, biological evaluation and docking-supported SAR analysis for novel 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R agents as derivatives of lead structure 4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-6-(phenoxymethyl)-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine (7). The lead modifications included an introduction of: (i) various small substituents at benzene ring, (ii) a branched ether linker or (iii) the ether oxygen replacement with other chalcogen (S, Se) or sulfonyl moiety. Hence, a series of new compounds (7-24) was synthesized and examined on their affinities for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R and selectivity, in respect to the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R and dopamine D<sub>2</sub> receptor, in the radioligand binding assays. For representative most active compounds functional bioassays and toxicity profile in vitro and antidepressant-like activity in vivo were examined. The 2-isopropyl-5-methylphenyl derivative (10) was found as the most active triazine 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonist (K<sub>i</sub> = 11 nM). SAR analysis indicated, that an exchange of oxygen to selenium (7 vs. 22), and especially, to sulfur (7 vs. 19) was beneficial to increase both affinity and antagonistic action for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R. Surprisingly, an introduction of SO<sub>2</sub> caused a drastic decrease of the 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R affinity, which was explained at a molecular level based on docking studies.

Biased ligands selective for either pathway are expected to regulate biological functions of GPCRs in a more precise way, therefore providing new drug molecules with superior efficacy and/or reduced side effects.

Sustained research has sought to identify selective ligands for receptor subtypes. In particular, activation of the D<sub>1</sub> receptor has attracted attention due to its promising role in neurological diseases. Initial attempts to identify agonists yielded catechol derivatives, mimicking dopamine, with suboptimal DMPK parameters and low selectivity over the D<sub>5</sub> subtype. However, more recent efforts to identify ligands capable of activating the D<sub>1</sub> receptor have made substantial progress with the identification of non-catechol agonists with suitable properties to progress to clinical studies. In addition, several research groups have identified positive allosteric modulators that offer new potential. Furthermore, structural studies have surprisingly uncovered two potential allosteric binding sites, the most characterized of which appears to be on intracellular loop 2 (ICL2). This review highlights the recent progress in the field, covering both orthosteric and allosteric modes of activation, discusses the elucidation of the allosteric binding sites, and summarizes the clinical development status of various compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4372473,20210302,155541775,440160090,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30525590,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,1,0,0

When activated by fatty acids, GPR40 elicits increased insulin secretion from islet β-cells only in the presence of elevated glucose levels. Towards this end, studies were undertaken towards discovering a novel GPR40 Agonist whose mode of action is via Positive Allosteric Modulation of the GPR40 receptor (AgoPAM). Efforts were made to identify a suitable GPR40 AgoPAM tool molecule to investigate mechanism of action and de-risk liver toxicity of GPR40 AgoPAMs due to reactive acyl-glucuronide (AG) metabolites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4388844,20210302,57706778,163320057,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31109791,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

Moreover, the flexible 2-ethanolamine linker of the most interesting compounds was replaced by the more conformationally constrained piperazine ring. In vitro functional studies performed on derivatives showing the highest affinities for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R highlighted that the shifting of the diphenyl moiety of derivatives 2 and 13 from position 6 to position 3 of the 1,4-dioxane nucleus, affording 11 and 16, respectively, modulated the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R functional profile from agonism to antagonism. Docking simulations, performed on the human 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R, further rationalized the biological results, delving into the features which modulate the shift between agonist and antagonist activity. Interestingly, compound 11, endowed with mixed 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R/α<sub>1d</sub>-AR antagonist profile, showed antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects on both PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines higher than those of the α<sub>1d</sub>-AR antagonist 2 and the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R antagonist 16.

GPCR ligands that differentially activate the downstream signaling pathways are termed functionally selective or biased ligands. A class of novel non-catechol G protein-biased agonists of the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) was recently disclosed. We conducted the first comprehensive structure-functional selectivity relationship study measuring G<sub>S</sub> and β-arrestin2 recruitment activities focused on four regions of this scaffold, resulting in over 50 analogs with diverse functional selectivity profiles. Some compounds became potent full agonists of β-arrestin2 recruitment, while others displayed enhanced G<sub>S</sub> bias compared to the starting compound. Pharmacokinetic testing of an analog with an altered functional selectivity profile demonstrated excellent blood-brain barrier penetration.

The insufficient quality of the available molecular probes prompted design of fluorinated 3-(1-alkyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-1H-indoles as a new generation of selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists. A potent and drug-like agonist, 3-(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-5-iodo-4-fluoro-1H-indole (AGH-192, 35, Ki 5-HT7R = 4 nM), was identified by optimizing the halogen bond formation with Ser5.42 as the supposed partner.

Recently, we discovered both G<sub>i/o</sub>-biased and β-arrestin2-biased D<sub>2</sub> receptor agonists based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug aripiprazole. In this work, based on another FDA-approved drug, cariprazine, we conducted a structure-functional selectivity relationship study and discovered compound 38 (MS1768) as a potent partial agonist that selectively activates the G<sub>i/o</sub> pathway over β-arrestin2. Unlike the dual D<sub>2</sub>R/D<sub>3</sub>R partial agonist cariprazine, compound 38 showed selective agonist activity for D<sub>2</sub>R over D<sub>3</sub>R. In fact, compound 38 exhibited potent antagonism of dopamine-stimulated β-arrestin2 recruitment. In our docking studies, compound 38 directly interacts with S193<sup>5.42</sup> on TM5 but has no interactions with extracellular loop 2, which appears to be in contrast to the binding poses of D<sub>2</sub>R β-arrestin2-biased ligands.

The H3R is considered as a drug target for the treatment of several central nervous system disorders. We have synthesized and identified a novel series of 4-aryl-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolinamines that act as selective H3R antagonists. Among all the synthesized compounds, in vitro and docking studies suggested that the 4-methoxy-phenyl-substituted tetrahydroquinazolinamine compound 4c has potent and selective H3R antagonist activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 0.04 μM). Compound 4c did not exhibit any activity on the hERG ion channel and pan-assay interference compounds liability. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 4c crosses the blood brain barrier, and in vivo studies demonstrated that 4c induces anorexia and weight loss in obese, but not in lean mice.

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity. Molecular modeling suggests that ML417 interacts with the D3R in a unique manner, possibly explaining its remarkable selectivity.

Recently, we reported a series of <i>N</i>-(3-hydroxy-4-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1<i>H</i>-indole-2-carboxamide analogues as high affinity and selective D<sub>3</sub>R lead molecules for the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUD). Further optimization led to a series of analogues that replaced the 3-OH with a 3-F in the linker between the primary pharmacophore (PP) and secondary pharmacophore (SP). Among the 3-F-compounds, <b>9b</b> demonstrated the highest D<sub>3</sub>R binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.756 nM) and was 327-fold selective for D<sub>3</sub>R over D<sub>2</sub>R. In addition, modification of the PP or SP with a 3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenyl group was also examined. Further, an enantioselective synthesis as well as chiral HPLC methods were developed to give enantiopure <i>R</i>- and <i>S</i>-enantiomers of the four lead compounds.

1616720,Literature-derived,Displacement of PPHT-red from SNAP-tagged human D2LR expressed in CHOK1 cell membranes assessed as association rate constant by TR-FRET assay,"Title: Structure-Kinetic Profiling of Haloperidol Analogues at the Human Dopamine D2 Receptor._||_Abstract: Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic drug (APD) associated with an increased risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPSs) and hyperprolactinemia relative to atypical APDs such as clozapine. Both drugs are dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonists, with contrasting kinetic profiles. Haloperidol displays fast association/slow dissociation at the D2R, whereas clozapine exhibits relatively slow association/fast dissociation. Recently, we have provided evidence that slow dissociation from the D2R predicts hyperprolactinemia, whereas fast association predicts EPS.

However, some patients lack an initial response to therapy (i.e., are refractory), and although the mean survival of MM patients has more than doubled in recent years, most patients will eventually relapse. To address this need, we explored the potential of novel cereblon E3 ligase modulators (CELMoDs) for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). We found that optimization beyond potency of degradation, including degradation efficiency and kinetics, could provide efficacy in a lenalidomide-resistant setting.

The D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are among the most important receptor targets in the treatment of schizophrenia, but antagonism at 5-HT<sub>6</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors may bring about additional improvement of cognitive functions. However, doubt exists regarding the importance of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R in the pharmacotherapy. In 2010, lurasidone (with high affinity for D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors) was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia. Due to the efficacy of the mentioned drug and doubts related to the role of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R, we decided to obtain compounds with an activity profile similar to that of lurasidone, but with the reduced affinity for 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R and increased affinity for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R. For this purpose, we chose aflexible hexyl derivative of lurasidone (2-(6-(4-(benzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-yl)hexyl)hexahydro-1H-4,7-methanoisoindole-1,3(2H)-dione 1a) as a hit structure. After molecular modeling, we modified it, in the area of the arylpiperazine and imide group, using the moieties found in other known CNS drugs.

A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent.

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

485358,Screening,HTS Assay for Allosteric Agonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Primary Screen for Agonists,"NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831-01_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley_||_Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

624464,Other,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Potentiators,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR).

624465,Other,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Agonists,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR).

624470,Summary,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Potentiator Summary,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR).
