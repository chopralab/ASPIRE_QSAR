Optimization of in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo activity in rodent models of psychosis has led to compound 24, which showed good affinities for human D(2), D(3), and 5-HT(1A) receptors but significantly less affinity for human alpha(1) adrenoceptors and rat H(1) and muscarinic receptors. In rodents, 24 showed functional D(2)-like antagonism and 5-HT(1A) partial agonism. After oral dosing, 24 showed good activity in rodent antipsychotic tests and very little potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), as measured by its ability to induce catalepsy in rats only at very high doses. In the light of this promising profile of activity, 24 has been selected for clinical investigation as a novel antipsychotic agent with a predicted low propensity to cause EPS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL669156,20181016,9865858,103337393,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10464021,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Target compounds were studied for their ability to bind to the DA D2 receptor in vitro and to inhibit dopamine synthesis and spontaneous locomotor activity in rats. Effects of tether length and relative stereochemistry were assessed for a series of 2-pyridylpiperazines. The cyclohexylethyl spacer was found to be the most active in the series. Further studies explored effects of changes in the arylpiperazine and indole portions of the molecule. From these studies trans-2-[[4-(1H-3-indolyl)cyclohexyl]ethyl]-4- (2-pyridinyl)piperazine (30a) was selected for further evaluation. It was characterized as a partial agonist of DA D2 receptors in vitro and caused decreases in dopamine synthesis and release as well as dopamine neuronal firing. Compound 30a was shown to be devoid of behavioral effects associated with postsynaptic DA D2 receptor activation. Furthermore, compound 30a was shown both to decrease DA synthesis and to inhibit Sidman avoidance responding in squirrel monkeys.

62919,Confirmatory,Binding affinity against dopamine receptor D2 using [3H]spiperone radioligand in CHO cells,"Title: N-Arylsulfonylindole derivatives as serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor ligands._||_Abstract: A series of N(1)-arylsulfonyltryptamines were found to be potent ligands of the human serotonin 5-HT(6) receptor with the 5-methoxy-1-benzenesulfonyl analogue (19) having the highest affinity. Additionally, it was discovered that a group such as 3-(3-methoxybenzyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl in the 2-position of the indole ring (43) can replace the arylsulfonyl substituent in the 1-position with no loss of affinity. This suggested that the binding conformation of the aminoethyl side chain at this receptor was toward the 4-position of the indole ring and was supported by the fact that the 4-(aminoethyl)indoles (45) also displayed high affinity, as did the conformationally rigid 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[c,d]indole (49). Molecular modeling showed that 19, 43, and 45 all had low-energy conformers that overlaid well onto 49.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels.

Targetting high affinity and D(3) versus D(2) receptor-preferring ligands, the partial agonist BP 897 was taken as a lead structure. Variations in the spacer and the aryl moiety led to N-alkylated 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)piperazines with markedly improved affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the structural development. Pharmacophore models for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor ligands were developed from their potentially bioactive conformation and were compared in order to get insight into molecular properties of importance for D(2)/D(3) receptor selectivity. For the 72 compounds presented here, an extended and more linear conformation in the aliphatic or aryl spacers turned out to be crucial for dopamine D(3) receptor selectivity. Structural diversity in the aryl moiety (benzamides, heteroarylamides, arylimides) had a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D(3) receptor affinity, which was optimized with more rigid aryl acrylamide derivatives. Compound 38 (ST 280, (E)-4-iodo-N-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide) displayed a most promising pharmacological profile (K(i) (hD(3)) = 0.5 nM; K(i) (hD(2L)) = 76.4 nM; selectivity ratio of 153), and above that, compound 38 offered the prospect of a novel radioligand as a pharmacological tool for various D(3) receptor-related in vitro and in vivo investigation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671730,20181017,3038495|9827991|10368423|10874342|10905430|10919602|10939008|10940279|10949917|10951185|10960767|10961112|10971923|10983103|10994916|11027407|11091160|11102188|11102301|11113582|11730189|11733372|11761374|11761412|11812299|11812905|11826347|11826673|21219157|44329321|44350586|44350625|44350653|44350660|44350674|44350675|44350679|44350685|44350714|44350728|44350752|44350754|44350759|44350773|44350774|44350782|44350788|44350795|44350796|44350798|44350799|44350806|44350824|44350826|44350835|44350839|44350841|44350842|44350843|44350845|44350849|44350852|44350861|44350867|44350871|44350874|44350875|44350888|44350889|44350908|44350909|44350919|44350920|44351005,103192597|103194907|103197235|103311769|103358646|103358762|103358789|103358854|103358867|103358870|103358895|103358896|103358898|103358944|103358948|103358949|103358956|103358966|103358967|103358971|103358988|103359060|103359061|103359092|103359193|103359199|103359208|103359239|103359240|103359265|103359266|103359272|103359281|103359298|103359310|103359311|103359313|103359314|103359332|103359336|103359337|103359338|103359342|103359345|103359378|103359402|103359405|103359420|103359431|103359434|103359435|103359437|103359440|103359452|103359465|103359467|103359487|103359489|103359497|103359505|103359507|103359516|103359527|103359530|103359567|103359568|103359569|103359570|103359571|103359614|103359615|103359649|103359650|103359793|103359830,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930150,0,,P14416,,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

X-ray structures and affinities of conformationally constrained ligands._||_Abstract: Conformational and molecular mechanics studies of a new series of tricyclic ligands with affinity for either the dopamine D2 receptor or the 5-HT1A receptor, or both, has enabled us to elaborate considerably on previous pharmacophore models for these receptors. The new tricyclic ligands are either angular, 2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indole derivatives, or linear, 2,3,3a,4,5,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives; they have either cis or trans ring junctions, and many of the ligands are resolved. In order to have X-ray crystal coordinates for every structural type, two additional crystal structures were determined: 14a, the trans-(+-)-6-hydroxy-3-(n-propyl) angular derivative as the hydrochloride, and (+-)-1,2,2a,3,4,8b-hexahydro-8-methoxy-2-(2-propenyl)-naphth[2,1- b]azetidine hydrochloride (16d). Several recently reported imidazoquinolinones with dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were also used in developing the models as were other known ligands which are conformationally constrained. A new method for determining intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor made consistent and reliable estimates of dopamine agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities available. The models explain these activities in terms of the 3-dimensional structural features of the ligands and their probable orientations at the D2 receptor site. They also explain why allyl and propyl analogs of some structures have very different affinities while affinities are quite similar for allyl and propyl analogs of other structures; at both receptors a particular orientation of the amine substituent in the binding site correlates with preference for allyl over propyl derivatives. Suggestions are made for enhancing selectivity at the 5-HT1A receptor or at the dopamine D2 receptor.

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors.

227608,Literature-derived,Intrinsic activity against dopamine D 2 receptor,"Title: Comparison of 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 pharmacophores. X-ray structures and affinities of conformationally constrained ligands._||_Abstract: Conformational and molecular mechanics studies of a new series of tricyclic ligands with affinity for either the dopamine D2 receptor or the 5-HT1A receptor, or both, has enabled us to elaborate considerably on previous pharmacophore models for these receptors. The new tricyclic ligands are either angular, 2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indole derivatives, or linear, 2,3,3a,4,5,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives; they have either cis or trans ring junctions, and many of the ligands are resolved. In order to have X-ray crystal coordinates for every structural type, two additional crystal structures were determined: 14a, the trans-(+-)-6-hydroxy-3-(n-propyl) angular derivative as the hydrochloride, and (+-)-1,2,2a,3,4,8b-hexahydro-8-methoxy-2-(2-propenyl)-naphth[2,1- b]azetidine hydrochloride (16d). Several recently reported imidazoquinolinones with dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were also used in developing the models as were other known ligands which are conformationally constrained. A new method for determining intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor made consistent and reliable estimates of dopamine agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities available. The models explain these activities in terms of the 3-dimensional structural features of the ligands and their probable orientations at the D2 receptor site. They also explain why allyl and propyl analogs of some structures have very different affinities while affinities are quite similar for allyl and propyl analogs of other structures; at both receptors a particular orientation of the amine substituent in the binding site correlates with preference for allyl over propyl derivatives. Suggestions are made for enhancing selectivity at the 5-HT1A receptor or at the dopamine D2 receptor. An angular, cis, (3aR,9bS), 2-propyl, 9-hydroxy, 3-(n-propyl) analog should be selective for the 5-HT1A receptor. A linear, trans, (3aR,9aS), 7-hydroxy, 1-(2-propenyl) analog should be selective for the dopamine D2 receptor, and would be predicted to be an antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872123,20181013,47811|122334|6604756|9882257|10014056|10014057|10105311|10105844|10332127|10355219|10377224|10466962|14944887|18988817|18988835|22849991|22849992|44266612|44266623|44266636|44266651|44266689|44274687|44274739|44275015|44275135|44275155|44275362|44275604|44275615|44275616|44275766,103170221|103170246|103170275|103170310|103170342|103170445|103171763|103171824|103171864|103171983|103175300|103193583|103193697|103193716|103193719|103193873|103194077|103194161|103194373|103194409|103194492|103194647|103194729|103194863|103195296|103195323|103195324|103195613|103195643|103244512|103700484|163333467,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496900,0,,P14416,10029.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels. These agents should be of therapeutic value in treating disorders resulting from hypo- and hyperdopaminergic activity, without the side effects associated with complete D2 agonism or antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850077,20200704,5374|148841|5311189|9927497|9949399|19432941|19432943|19432944|19432945|21479400|21479403|21479410|21479414|21479415|21479416|44355694|44355710|44355732|44355761|44355918|44355919|44355928|44355929|44355935|44355973|44355978|44355989|44355995|44356007|44356019|44356048|44356061|44356068|44356069|44356070|44356093|44356120|44356121|44356132|44356133|44356141|44356251|44356252|44356265|44356267|44356275|44356279|44356285|44356290|44356294|44356303|44356304|44356323|44356329|44356330|44356524|44356533|45262004|45262088|45265212,103166191|103185398|103370717|103370718|103370719|103370745|103370775|103370812|103371055|103371056|103371058|103371082|103371083|103371092|103371110|103371111|103371119|103371141|103371150|103371158|103371175|103371231|103371243|103371253|103371276|103371278|103371280|103371281|103371334|103371335|103371356|103371358|103371390|103371391|103371405|103371406|103371430|103371633|103371644|103371645|103371668|103371670|103371691|103371693|103371698|103371710|103371720|103371727|103371738|103371739|103371765|103371776|103371777|103371816|103372115|103372146|103372148|103673437|103673549|103678351,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9435894,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Herein, we describe our research of the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in a series of (S)-spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,5'-oxazolidin]-2'-ones bearing various bicyclic moieties to discover novel alpha7 receptor agonists. Through a number of SAR studies on the series, we have found out that inhibition of CYP 2D6 isozyme, which was a primary obstacle for the previously identified compound, was avoidable by the introduction of bicyclic moieties. Chemical optimization of the series led to the identification of a novel and potent alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist 23. This compound not only possessed high binding affinity (K(i) = 3 nmol/L) toward the alpha7 receptor but also showed agonistic activity even at a concentration of 0.1 micromol/L. In addition, compound 23 improved cognition in several rat models, which might suggest the potential of the alpha7 receptor partial agonist for the treatment of neurological disorders including cognitive dysfunction.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL869737,20181020,71450922,163316016,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16821797,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Compound 6 [PG01037, (N-(4-(4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)-trans-but-2-enyl)-4-pyridine-2-ylbenzamide)] and related analogues are currently being evaluated in animal models of drug addiction. In these studies, a discrepancy between in vitro binding affinity, in vivo occupancy, and behavioral potency has been observed. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) modifications of the 2-pyridylphenyl moiety of 6 and (2) hydroxyl, acetyl, and cyclopropyl substitutions on the butylamide linking chain systematically coupled with 2-fluorenylamide or 2-pyridylphenylamide and 2-methoxy- or 2,3-dichloro-substituted phenylpiperazines to measure the impact on binding affinity, D2/D3 selectivity, lipophilicity, and function. In general, these modifications were well tolerated at the human dopamine D3 (hD3) receptor (Ki = 1-5 nM) as measured in competition binding assays. Several analogues showed >100-fold selectivity for dopamine D3 over D2 and D4 receptors. In addition, while all the derivatives with an olefinic linker were antagonists, in quinpirole-stimulated mitogenesis at hD3 receptors, several of the hydroxybutyl-linked analogues (16, 17, 21) showed partial agonist activity. Finally, several structural modifications reduced lipophilicities while retaining the desired binding profile.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL895648,20181022,9826580|9891901|11477180|11676873|25141533|44309775|44427818|44427820|44427821|44427822|44427823|44427824|44427825|44427826|44427827|44427829|44427831|44427835|44427836|44427839|44427840|44427841|44427842,103252237|103265819|103265917|103440257|103472584|103526705|103526706|103526707|103526708|103526709|103526710|103526711|103526712|103526713|103526714|103526715|103526716|103526717|103526718|103526720|103526721|103526722|103526723,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17672446,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Standard treatment, targeting monoamine transporters selective for the neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline, is not able to help many patients that are poor responders. This study advances the development of sazetidine-A analogues that interact with α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as partial agonists and that possess favorable antidepressant profiles. The resulting compounds that are highly selective for the α4β2 subtype of nAChR over α3β4-nAChRs are partial agonists at the α4β2 subtype and have excellent antidepressant behavioral profiles as measured by the mouse forced swim test. Preliminary absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies for one promising ligand revealed an excellent plasma protein binding (PPB) profile, low CYP450-related metabolism, and low cardiovascular toxicity, suggesting it is a promising lead as well as a drug candidate to be advanced through the drug discovery pipeline.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1838255,20200629,56595309,134450722,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21905669,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects. These novel chemical entities could potentially be advanced to the clinic as new drug candidates for treating depression.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026364,20200626,45254040|56951368|56951495,160678244|160688954|160705128,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22171543,0,,P14416,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167814,20180923,851833|10454026|10456166|42626318,103356575|103402070|124969027|163329505,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,,P14416,9606.0,54.0,,,0,1,0,1,0,0

The major drawback of C-11 tracers is the lack of cyclotron facility in many health care centers thereby limiting widespread clinical or research use. We identified the fluoroethyl derivative, 2-(4-(4-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione (FECUMI-101) (Ki=0.1nM; Emax=77%; EC50=0.65nM) as a partial agonist 5-HT1AR ligand of the parent ligand CUMI-101. FECUMI-101 is radiolabeled with F-18 by O-fluoroethylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue (1) with [(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate in DMSO in the presence of 1.6equiv of K2CO3 in 45±5% yield (EOS). PET shows [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binds specifically to 5-HT1AR enriched brain regions of baboon. The specificity of [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binding to 5-HT1AR was confirmed by challenge studies with the known 5-HT1AR ligand WAY100635. These findings indicate that [(18)F]FECUMI-101 can be a viable agonist ligand for the in vivo quantification of high affinity 5-HT1AR with PET.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2416736,20200629,21830793|73346042,174487458|174487459,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23816046,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Exploitation of the original structure-activity relationships resulted in the identification of safe and effective antipsychotics devoid of extrapyramidal symptoms liability, sedation, and catalepsy. The potential atypical antipsychotic 5bb was selected for further pharmacological investigation. The distribution of c-fos positive cells in the ventral striatum confirmed the atypical antipsychotic profile of 5bb in agreement with behavioral rodent studies. 5bb administered orally demonstrated a biphasic effect on the MK801-induced hyperactivity at dose levels not able to induce sedation, catalepsy, or learning impairment in passive avoidance. In microdialysis studies, 5bb increased the dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, 5bb represents a valuable lead for the development of atypical antipsychotics endowed with a unique pharmacological profile for addressing negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3381713,20181005,5073|60795|11350623|11494093|11501253|11501537|11537385|11567578|11567928|11603119|11603486|11625642|11638640|11639248|11676638|11696813|24769156|34257212|51122451|57456630|57873490|57873491|57873492|57873499|57873504|57873508|57873513|57873515|57873518|57873520|57873522|57873525|57873527|57873531|60204111|60204112|118722639|118722912|118722913|118722914|118722915|135398737|135398745,103165765|103170825|103195217|103307946|103627886|312371860|312371861|312371862|312371863|312371864|312371865|312371866|312371867|312371868|312371869|312372258|312372259|312372260|312372261|312372262|312372263|312372264|312372265|312372266|312372267|312372268|312372269|312372270|312372271|312372272|312372273|312372274|312372275|312372276|312372277|312372278|312372279|312372280|312372281|312372282|312372283|312372284|312372285,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25343529,0,,P14416,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

A common molecular template used in the development of D3R-selective antagonists and partial agonists incorporates a butylamide linker between two pharmacophores, a phenylpiperazine moiety and an extended aryl ring system. The series of compounds described herein incorporates a change to that chemical template, replacing the amide functional group in the linker chain with a 1,2,3-triazole group. Although the amide linker in the 4-phenylpiperazine class of D3R ligands has been previously deemed critical for high D3R affinity and selectivity, the 1,2,3-triazole moiety serves as a suitable bioisosteric replacement and maintains desired D3R-binding functionality of the compounds. Additionally, using mouse liver microsomes to evaluate CYP450-mediated phase I metabolism, we determined that novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing compounds modestly improves metabolic stability compared to amide-containing analogues.

To rationalize the experimental observations and derive information about receptor-ligand interactions of the reported ligands, docking studies, using 5-HT1A and α1d-AR models generated by homology techniques, and a retrospective computational study were performed. The results highlighted that proper substituents in position 2 of the phenoxy moiety of 3 selectively address the ligands toward 5-HT1A receptor with respect to α1-ARs and D2-like receptor subtypes. Methoxymethylenoxy derivative 9 showed the best 5-HT1A selectivity profile and the highest potency at 5-HT1A receptor, behaving as a partial agonist.

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations. These receptor models bound with partial agonists may be useful for structure-based design of compounds with tailored efficacy profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4052936,20200622,10456166|42626240|42626318|58358826|122181006|137635743|137639330|137647150|137648255|137653517|137656298|137657276,103402070|124961101|124969027|163334704|318376630|381843105|381848416|381859990|381861617|381869422|381873560|381879252,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27983845,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

We identified several novel D4R-selective ( Ki ≤ 4.3 nM and >100-fold vs other D2-like receptors) compounds with diverse partial agonist and antagonist profiles, falling into three structural groups. These compounds highlight receptor-ligand interactions that control efficacy at D2-like receptors and may provide insights into targeted drug discovery, leading to a better understanding of the role of D4Rs in neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4392168,20210302,4797946|6466372|10425450|16094666|45361874|109030343|109030515|155530763|155536720|155562395|155563301,103503876|103503918|440117695|440118212|440123600|440130571|440140737|440149835|440211928|440214136|440224758,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30883109,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Recently, we reported a series of <i>N</i>-(3-hydroxy-4-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)butyl)-1<i>H</i>-indole-2-carboxamide analogues as high affinity and selective D<sub>3</sub>R lead molecules for the treatment of opioid use disorders (OUD). Further optimization led to a series of analogues that replaced the 3-OH with a 3-F in the linker between the primary pharmacophore (PP) and secondary pharmacophore (SP). Among the 3-F-compounds, <b>9b</b> demonstrated the highest D<sub>3</sub>R binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.756 nM) and was 327-fold selective for D<sub>3</sub>R over D<sub>2</sub>R. In addition, modification of the PP or SP with a 3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenyl group was also examined. Further, an enantioselective synthesis as well as chiral HPLC methods were developed to give enantiopure <i>R</i>- and <i>S</i>-enantiomers of the four lead compounds. Off-target binding affinities, functional efficacies, and metabolic profiles revealed critical structural components for D<sub>3</sub>R selectivity as well as drug-like features required for development as pharmacotherapeutics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4415924,20210302,130431288|130431289|130431291|130431294|130431295|130431296|130431306|130431314|130431315|130431316|130431318|130431319|130431328|130431329|146451658|146451661|146451664|146451691,440111877|440122026|440126918|440139378|440141145|440141550|440152147|440154984|440157158|440159640|440160522|440166730|440172590|440189513|440195867|440197499|440212978|440220383,1813,,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31526003,0,,P14416,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats.
