The trafficking and gating properties of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) can be amplified by transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins (TARPs), which are often expressed in localized brain regions. Herein, we describe the discovery, lead optimization, and preclinical characterization of 5-arylbenzimidazolone and oxindole-based negative modulators of AMPARs associated with TARP γ-8, the primary TARP found in hippocampus. High-throughput screen lead 4 was optimized for potency and brain penetration to provide benzimidazolone 3, JNJ-55511118.1 Replacement of the benzimidazolone core in 3 with an oxindole mitigated reactive metabolite formation and led to the identification of 18 (GluA1/γ-8 pIC50 = 9.7).

Allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors promote dimerization by binding to a dimer interface and reducing desensitization and deactivation. The pyrrolidine allosteric modulators, piracetam and aniracetam, were among the first of this class of drugs to be discovered. We have determined the structure of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA receptor subtypes GluA2 and GluA3 with piracetam and a corresponding structure of GluA3 with aniracetam. Both drugs bind to GluA2 and GluA3 in a very similar manner, suggesting little subunit specificity. However, the binding sites for piracetam and aniracetam differ considerably. Aniracetam binds to a symmetrical site at the center of the dimer interface. Piracetam binds to multiple sites along the dimer interface with low occupation, one of which is a unique binding site for potential allosteric modulators. This new site may be of importance in the design of new allosteric regulators.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1072470,20180912,4843,103213021,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20163115,0,,P42261,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

NMDA receptors have been implicated in a wide range of neurological diseases and thus represent an important therapeutic target. We herein describe a novel series of pyrrolidinones that selectively potentiate only NMDA receptors that contain the GluN2C subunit. The most active analogues tested were over 100-fold selective for recombinant GluN2C-containing receptors over GluN2A/B/D-containing NMDA receptors as well as AMPA and kainate receptors. This series represents the first class of allosteric potentiators that are selective for diheteromeric GluN2C-containing NMDA receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3241942,20181003,3157599,103631588,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24512267,0,,P42261,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0
