Polyamine toxins are extensively used for the characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. We have previously shown that an analogue of PhTX-433 with one of the amino groups replaced by a methylene group, philanthotoxin-83 (PhTX-83) is a selective and potent antagonist of AMPA receptors. We now describe the solid-phase synthesis of analogues of PhTX-83 and the electrophysiological characterization of these analogues on cloned AMPA and kainate receptors. The polyamine portion of PhTX-83 was modified systematically by changing the position of the secondary amino group along the polyamine chain. In another series of analogues, the acyl moiety of PhTX-83 was replaced by acids of different size and lipophilicity. Using electrophysiological techniques, PhTX-56 was shown to be a highly potent (K(i) = 3.3 +/- 0.78 nM) and voltage-dependent antagonist of homomeric GluR1 receptors and was more than 1000-fold less potent when tested on heteromeric GluR1+GluR2, as well as homomeric GluR5(Q) receptors, thus being selective for Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Variation of the acyl group of PhTX-83 had only minor effect on antagonist potency at homomeric GluR1 receptors but led to a significant decrease in the voltage-dependence. In conclusion, PhTX-56 is a novel, very potent, and selective antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and is a promising tool for structure/function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL680870,20181017,10598970|14608128|44368884|44368885|44368886|44368895|44368910|44369047|44369048|44369061|44369062|44369077|44369235|44369248|44369251|44369283|44369293|44369295|44369306|44369308,103242301|103395119|103401345|103401346|103401347|103401358|103401386|103401656|103401657|103401689|103401691|103401729|103402004|103402031|103402035|103402084|103402111|103402115|103402135|103402137,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477358,0,,P42261,,129148.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Synthesis and quantitative structure-activity relationships._||_Abstract: A number of 3-isoxazolol bioisosteres, 7a-i, of (S)-glutamic acid (Glu), in which the methyl group of (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA, 1) was replaced by different 5-membered heterocyclic rings, were synthesized. Comparative in vitro pharmacological studies on this series of AMPA analogues were performed using receptor binding assays (IC50 values) and the electrophysiological rat cortical slice model (EC50 values). None of these compounds showed detectable affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subtype of Glu receptors. Some of the compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H]kainic acid binding. The inhibitory effects on [3H]AMPA binding and agonist potencies at AMPA receptors of 7a-i were strictly dependent on the structure, electrostatic potential, and methyl substitution of the heterocyclic 5-substituent. Thus, while 7a (IC50 = 0.094 microM; EC50 = 2.3 microM) was approximately equipotent with AMPA (IC50 = 0.023 microM; EC50 = 5.4 microM), (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)isoxazol-4-yl]propio nic acid (7b) (IC50 = 48 microM; EC50 = 550 microM) was some 2 orders of magnitude weaker than AMPA, and (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-isoxazol-4 -yl] propionic acid (7c) (IC50 > 100 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive. Furthermore, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7i) (IC50 = 0.030 microM; EC50 = 0.92 microM) was more potent than AMPA, whereas its N-1 methyl isomer, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7h) (IC50 = 54 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive as an AMPA agonist. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed a positive correlation between receptor affinity, electrostatic potential near the nitrogen atom at the 'ortho' position of the heterocyclic 5-substituent, and the rotational energy barrier around the bond connecting the two rings. We envisage that a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group and an ortho-positioned heteroatom of the ring substituent at the 5-position stabilize receptor-active conformations of these AMPA analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL702521,20181015,1221|3481675|10562939|10610792|10658567|10729534|10752476|10800053|10823814|10824747,103174429|103289365|103309919|103309920|103310042|103310043|103310045|103310166|103310208|103310209,2890|2891|2892|2893,In vitro,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9288165,0,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

One of the compounds, 2-amino-3-[3-(carboxymethoxy)-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl]propionic acid (AMOA, 7), was synthesized via O-alkylation by ethyl chloroacetate of the amino acid protected AMPA derivative 4. The other compound, 2-amino-3-[2-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)-methyl-5-methyl-3-+ ++oxoisoxazolin -4-yl]propionic acid (AMNH, 14) was synthesized with use of 4-(chloromethyl)-3-methoxy-5-methylisoxazole (8) as the starting material. The intermediate 4-(chloromethyl)-2-(3-methoxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)methyl-5-me thylisoxazolin- 3-one (11) was converted into the acetamidomalonate (12), which was stepwise deprotected to give 14. Compounds 7 and 14 were stable in aqueous solution at pH values close to physiological pH. Neither 7 nor 14 showed detectable affinities for the receptor, ion channel, or modulatory sites of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex. Quantitative receptor autoradiographic and conventional binding techniques were used to study the affinities of 7 and 14 for non-NMDA receptor sites. Both compounds were inhibitors of the binding of [3H]AMPA (IC50 = 90 and 29 microM, respectively). Compounds 14 and 7 were both very weak inhibitors of the high-affinity binding of radioactive kainic acid [( 3H]KAIN).

In the rat cortical slice preparation, 7 was shown to antagonize excitation induced by 1 with some selectivity, whereas 14 proved to be a rather selective antagonist of KAIN-induced excitation.

Synthesis, modeling, and molecular pharmacology._||_Abstract: We have previously described (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (4-AHCP) as a highly effective agonist at non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate (Glu) receptors in vivo, which is more potent than (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) but inactive at NMDA receptors. However, 4-AHCP was found to be much weaker than AMPA as an inhibitor of [(3)H]AMPA binding and to have limited effect in a [(3)H]kainic acid binding assay using rat cortical membranes. To shed light on the mechanism(s) underlying this quite enigmatic pharmacological profile of 4-AHCP, we have now developed a synthesis of (S)-4-AHCP (6) and (R)-4-AHCP (7). At cloned metabotropic Glu receptors mGluR1alpha (group I), mGluR2 (group II), and mGluR4a (group III), neither 6 nor 7 showed significant agonist or antagonist effects. The stereoisomer 6, but not 7, activated cloned AMPA receptor subunits GluR1o, GluR3o, and GluR4o with EC(50) values in the range 4.5-15 microM and the coexpressed kainate-preferring subunits GluR6 + KA2 (EC(50) = 6.4 microM).

Compound 6 thus represents a new structural class of GluR5 agonists. Molecular modeling and docking to a crystal structure of the extracellular binding domain of the AMPA subunit GluR2 has enabled identification of the probable active conformation and binding mode of 6.

Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys.

The design was carried out on the basis of the molecular modeling of a number of potent adenosine receptor antagonists described in the literature. Three compounds (25b-d) showed an interesting affinity and selectivity for the A(2A) subtype.

The initially reported tryptamine analogues displayed either poor solution stability, potent central nervous system activity, or both of these undesirable characteristics and were unacceptable for clinical evaluation. A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect.

PET studies in anesthetized baboon demonstrate [(11)C]10 specific binding in brain regions rich in 5-HT(1A) receptors. Binding of [(11)C]10 was blocked by WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT. The regional brain volumes of distribution (V(T)) of [(11)C]10 in baboon correlate with [(11)C]WAY100635 V(T) in baboons.

Through a number of SAR studies on the series, we have found out that inhibition of CYP 2D6 isozyme, which was a primary obstacle for the previously identified compound, was avoidable by the introduction of bicyclic moieties. Chemical optimization of the series led to the identification of a novel and potent alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist 23. This compound not only possessed high binding affinity (K(i) = 3 nmol/L) toward the alpha7 receptor but also showed agonistic activity even at a concentration of 0.1 micromol/L.

Several members of this class inhibit NMDA receptor responses in the nanomolar range and are more than 50-fold selective over GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors, as well as AMPA, kainate, GABA, glycine, nicotinic, serotonin, and purinergic receptors. Analysis of the purified enantiomers of one of the more potent and selective compounds shows that the S-enantiomer is both more potent and more selective than the R-enantiomer.

Compound 6b showed unprecedented selectivity among ( S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subtypes, confirmed also by an unusual binding mode observed for the crystal structures in complex with the AMPA receptor GluA2 agonist-binding domain. Here, a methionine (Met729) was highly disordered compared to previous agonist-bound structures. This observation provides a possible explanation for the pharmacological profile. In the structure with 7a, an unusual organization of water molecules around the bioisostere arises compared to previous structures of ligands with other bioisosteres.

Polyamine toxins are extensively used for the characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. We have previously shown that an analogue of PhTX-433 with one of the amino groups replaced by a methylene group, philanthotoxin-83 (PhTX-83) is a selective and potent antagonist of AMPA receptors. We now describe the solid-phase synthesis of analogues of PhTX-83 and the electrophysiological characterization of these analogues on cloned AMPA and kainate receptors. The polyamine portion of PhTX-83 was modified systematically by changing the position of the secondary amino group along the polyamine chain. In another series of analogues, the acyl moiety of PhTX-83 was replaced by acids of different size and lipophilicity. Using electrophysiological techniques, PhTX-56 was shown to be a highly potent (K(i) = 3.3 +/- 0.78 nM) and voltage-dependent antagonist of homomeric GluR1 receptors and was more than 1000-fold less potent when tested on heteromeric GluR1+GluR2, as well as homomeric GluR5(Q) receptors, thus being selective for Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Variation of the acyl group of PhTX-83 had only minor effect on antagonist potency at homomeric GluR1 receptors but led to a significant decrease in the voltage-dependence. In conclusion, PhTX-56 is a novel, very potent, and selective antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and is a promising tool for structure/function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL680869,20181017,10598970|14608128|44368884|44368885|44368886|44368895|44368910|44369047|44369048|44369061|44369062|44369077|44369235|44369248|44369251|44369283|44369293|44369295|44369306|44369308,103242301|103395119|103401345|103401346|103401347|103401358|103401386|103401656|103401657|103401689|103401691|103401729|103402004|103402031|103402035|103402084|103402111|103402115|103402135|103402137,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477358,0,,P42261,,129148.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

One of the compounds, 2-amino-3-[3-(carboxymethoxy)-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl]propionic acid (AMOA, 7), was synthesized via O-alkylation by ethyl chloroacetate of the amino acid protected AMPA derivative 4.

The intermediate 4-(chloromethyl)-2-(3-methoxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)methyl-5-me thylisoxazolin- 3-one (11) was converted into the acetamidomalonate (12), which was stepwise deprotected to give 14. Compounds 7 and 14 were stable in aqueous solution at pH values close to physiological pH. Neither 7 nor 14 showed detectable affinities for the receptor, ion channel, or modulatory sites of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex. Quantitative receptor autoradiographic and conventional binding techniques were used to study the affinities of 7 and 14 for non-NMDA receptor sites. Both compounds were inhibitors of the binding of [3H]AMPA (IC50 = 90 and 29 microM, respectively). Compounds 14 and 7 were both very weak inhibitors of the high-affinity binding of radioactive kainic acid [( 3H]KAIN). Compound 14, but not 7, was, however, shown to be an inhibitor of low-affinity [3H]KAIN binding (IC50 = 40 microM) as determined in the presence of 100 mM calcium chloride. In the rat cortical slice preparation, 7 was shown to antagonize excitation induced by 1 with some selectivity, whereas 14 proved to be a rather selective antagonist of KAIN-induced excitation. Both antagonists showed very weak effects on the excitatory effects of NMDA. Compound 7 was a poor antagonist of excitation by quisqualic acid (2), whereas 14 did not affect excitation by this nonselective AMPA receptor agonist. On cat spinal neurones, both 7 and 14 reduced excitations by 1 and KAIN, but, again, the excitatory effects of 2 were much less sensitive. Compound 14 and, in particular, 7 effectively protected rat striatal neurones against the neurotoxic effects of KAIN, whereas the toxic effects of 1 were reduced only by 7. Neither antagonist showed protection against the cell damage caused by intrastriatal injection of the NMDA agonist quinolinic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL702522,20181013,1221|125406|125407,103174429|103223955|103759912,2890|2891|2892|2893,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1825114,0,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Both compounds were inhibitors of the binding of [3H]AMPA (IC50 = 90 and 29 microM, respectively). Compounds 14 and 7 were both very weak inhibitors of the high-affinity binding of radioactive kainic acid [( 3H]KAIN). Compound 14, but not 7, was, however, shown to be an inhibitor of low-affinity [3H]KAIN binding (IC50 = 40 microM) as determined in the presence of 100 mM calcium chloride. In the rat cortical slice preparation, 7 was shown to antagonize excitation induced by 1 with some selectivity, whereas 14 proved to be a rather selective antagonist of KAIN-induced excitation. Both antagonists showed very weak effects on the excitatory effects of NMDA. Compound 7 was a poor antagonist of excitation by quisqualic acid (2), whereas 14 did not affect excitation by this nonselective AMPA receptor agonist. On cat spinal neurones, both 7 and 14 reduced excitations by 1 and KAIN, but, again, the excitatory effects of 2 were much less sensitive. Compound 14 and, in particular, 7 effectively protected rat striatal neurones against the neurotoxic effects of KAIN, whereas the toxic effects of 1 were reduced only by 7. Neither antagonist showed protection against the cell damage caused by intrastriatal injection of the NMDA agonist quinolinic acid.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL700578,20181013,1221|125406|125407,103174429|103223955|103759912,2890|2891|2892|2893,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1825114,0,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

The compounds showed noncompetitive antagonistic activity at the kainate receptor subtype GluR5. The most potent compounds showed more than 50-fold selectivity for GluR5 compared to GluR6 and the AMPA receptor subtypes GluR1-4. The structure-activity relationships for the AUBAs showed distinct structural requirements for the substituents on the two aromatic ring systems. Only para-substituents were tolerated on the benzoic acid moiety (ring A), whereas ring B tolerated a variety of substituents, but with a preference for lipophilic substituents. The most potent compounds had a 4-chloro substituent on ring A and 3-chlorobenzene (6b), 2-naphthalene (8h), or 2-indole (8k) as ring B and had IC(50) values of 1.3, 1.2, and 1.2 microM, respectively, in a functional GluR5 assay. Compound 6c (IC(50) = 4.8 microM at GluR5) showed activity in the in vivo ATPA rigidity test, indicating that 6c has better pharmacokinetic properties than 8h, which was inactive in this test.

We report here the novel synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a range of willardiine (18-23) and 6-azawillardiine (24-28) analogs on cells individually expressing human homomeric hGluR1, hGluR2, hGluR4, or hGluR5 receptors. Reaction of the sodium salts of substituted uracils (7-12) or 6-azauracils (13-16) with (S)-3-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]oxetan-2-one (17) in dry DMF, subsequent deprotection in TFA, and purification by ion-exchange chromatography gave mainly the willardiine analog in which alkylation took place on N1 of the uracil ring. We have investigated the subtype selectivity of these compounds by examining their binding affinity for homomeric hGluR1, -2, -4, or -5 (and hGluR6 in the case of 5-iodowillardiine (22)). From this study we have demonstrated that 22 has high affinity for hGluR5 and, compared to kainate, displays excellent selectivity for this receptor over both the AMPA receptor subtypes and the homomeric kainate receptor, hGluR6. 5-Fluorowillardiine (19) has higher affinity than AMPA for both homomeric hGluR1 and hGluR2 and compared to AMPA displays greater selectivity for AMPA receptor subtypes over the kainate receptor, hGluR5. Some structural features required for optimal activity at homomeric AMPA or kainate receptor subtypes have also been identified. It would appear that quite large lipophilic substituents at the 5-position of the uracil ring not only are accommodated by hGluR5 receptors but also lead to enhanced affinity for these receptors. In contrast to this, for optimal binding affinity to hGluR1, -2, or -4, smaller, electron-withdrawing substituents are required. For optimal activity at hGluR4 receptors a 6-aza-substituted willardiine is favored. The subtype-selective compounds described here are likely to be useful tools to probe the distribution and the physiological roles of the various glutamate receptor subunits in the central nervous system.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL878883,20181015,10255|33032|126569|158397|167842|440053|447196|9795654|11096831|44152410|44346780|44346789|44346790|44346798,103174497|103177538|103348860|103348889|103348920|103349335|103349388|103349444|103349464|103349465|103349475|103349477|103349493|103699331,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9357531,0,,P42261,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The greatest selectivity and potency were achieved with the 3-(2-naphthyl)prop-2-enyl compound.

The sequencing of the human genome has identified more than 400 putative ion channels, but only a fraction of these have been cloned and functionally tested. The widespread tissue distribution of ion channels, coupled with the plethora of physiological consequences of their opening and closing, makes ion-channel-targeted drug discovery highly compelling. However, despite some important drugs in clinical use today, as a class, ion channels remain underexploited in drug discovery and many existing drugs are poorly selective with significant toxicities or suboptimal efficacy. This Perspective seeks to review the ion channel family, its structural and functional features, and the diseases that are known to be modulated by members of the family.

Compound 6b showed unprecedented selectivity among ( S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subtypes, confirmed also by an unusual binding mode observed for the crystal structures in complex with the AMPA receptor GluA2 agonist-binding domain. Here, a methionine (Met729) was highly disordered compared to previous agonist-bound structures. This observation provides a possible explanation for the pharmacological profile. In the structure with 7a, an unusual organization of water molecules around the bioisostere arises compared to previous structures of ligands with other bioisosteres. Aspartate analogue 8 with the hydroxy-1,2,3-triazole moiety directly attached to glycine was unexpectedly able to activate both the glutamate and glycine agonist-binding sites of the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor.
