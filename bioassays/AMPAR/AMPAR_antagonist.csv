Polyamine toxins are extensively used for the characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. We have previously shown that an analogue of PhTX-433 with one of the amino groups replaced by a methylene group, philanthotoxin-83 (PhTX-83) is a selective and potent antagonist of AMPA receptors. We now describe the solid-phase synthesis of analogues of PhTX-83 and the electrophysiological characterization of these analogues on cloned AMPA and kainate receptors. The polyamine portion of PhTX-83 was modified systematically by changing the position of the secondary amino group along the polyamine chain. In another series of analogues, the acyl moiety of PhTX-83 was replaced by acids of different size and lipophilicity. Using electrophysiological techniques, PhTX-56 was shown to be a highly potent (K(i) = 3.3 +/- 0.78 nM) and voltage-dependent antagonist of homomeric GluR1 receptors and was more than 1000-fold less potent when tested on heteromeric GluR1+GluR2, as well as homomeric GluR5(Q) receptors, thus being selective for Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Variation of the acyl group of PhTX-83 had only minor effect on antagonist potency at homomeric GluR1 receptors but led to a significant decrease in the voltage-dependence. In conclusion, PhTX-56 is a novel, very potent, and selective antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and is a promising tool for structure/function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL680870,20181017,10598970|14608128|44368884|44368885|44368886|44368895|44368910|44369047|44369048|44369061|44369062|44369077|44369235|44369248|44369251|44369283|44369293|44369295|44369306|44369308,103242301|103395119|103401345|103401346|103401347|103401358|103401386|103401656|103401657|103401689|103401691|103401729|103402004|103402031|103402035|103402084|103402111|103402115|103402135|103402137,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477358,0,,P42261,,129148.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Neither 7 nor 14 showed detectable affinities for the receptor, ion channel, or modulatory sites of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex. Quantitative receptor autoradiographic and conventional binding techniques were used to study the affinities of 7 and 14 for non-NMDA receptor sites. Both compounds were inhibitors of the binding of [3H]AMPA (IC50 = 90 and 29 microM, respectively).

Synthesis, modeling, and molecular pharmacology._||_Abstract: We have previously described (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (4-AHCP) as a highly effective agonist at non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate (Glu) receptors in vivo, which is more potent than (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) but inactive at NMDA receptors. However, 4-AHCP was found to be much weaker than AMPA as an inhibitor of [(3)H]AMPA binding and to have limited effect in a [(3)H]kainic acid binding assay using rat cortical membranes. To shed light on the mechanism(s) underlying this quite enigmatic pharmacological profile of 4-AHCP, we have now developed a synthesis of (S)-4-AHCP (6) and (R)-4-AHCP (7). At cloned metabotropic Glu receptors mGluR1alpha (group I), mGluR2 (group II), and mGluR4a (group III), neither 6 nor 7 showed significant agonist or antagonist effects. The stereoisomer 6, but not 7, activated cloned AMPA receptor subunits GluR1o, GluR3o, and GluR4o with EC(50) values in the range 4.5-15 microM and the coexpressed kainate-preferring subunits GluR6 + KA2 (EC(50) = 6.4 microM). Compound 6, but not 7, proved to be a very potent agonist (EC(50) = 0.13 microM) at the kainate-preferring GluR5 subunit, equipotent with (S)-2-amino-3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisothiazol-4-yl)propionic acid [(S)-Thio-ATPA, 4] and almost 4 times more potent than (S)-2-amino-3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid [(S)-ATPA, 3]. Compound 6 thus represents a new structural class of GluR5 agonists. Molecular modeling and docking to a crystal structure of the extracellular binding domain of the AMPA subunit GluR2 has enabled identification of the probable active conformation and binding mode of 6. We are able to rationalize the observed selectivities by comparing the docking of 4 and 6 to subtype constructs, i.e., a crystal structure of the extracellular binding domain of GluR2 and a homology model of GluR5.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL884410,20181017,447407|5288598|5289518,103199065|103199750|103199751,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12672235,0,,P42261,8355.0,129148.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys.

Several members of this class inhibit NMDA receptor responses in the nanomolar range and are more than 50-fold selective over GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors, as well as AMPA, kainate, GABA, glycine, nicotinic, serotonin, and purinergic receptors. Analysis of the purified enantiomers of one of the more potent and selective compounds shows that the S-enantiomer is both more potent and more selective than the R-enantiomer. The S-enantiomer had an IC50 of 0.17-0.22 μM at GluN2D- and GluN2C-containing receptors, respectively, and showed over 70-fold selectivity over other NMDA receptor subunits.

Polyamine toxins are extensively used for the characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. We have previously shown that an analogue of PhTX-433 with one of the amino groups replaced by a methylene group, philanthotoxin-83 (PhTX-83) is a selective and potent antagonist of AMPA receptors. We now describe the solid-phase synthesis of analogues of PhTX-83 and the electrophysiological characterization of these analogues on cloned AMPA and kainate receptors. The polyamine portion of PhTX-83 was modified systematically by changing the position of the secondary amino group along the polyamine chain. In another series of analogues, the acyl moiety of PhTX-83 was replaced by acids of different size and lipophilicity. Using electrophysiological techniques, PhTX-56 was shown to be a highly potent (K(i) = 3.3 +/- 0.78 nM) and voltage-dependent antagonist of homomeric GluR1 receptors and was more than 1000-fold less potent when tested on heteromeric GluR1+GluR2, as well as homomeric GluR5(Q) receptors, thus being selective for Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Variation of the acyl group of PhTX-83 had only minor effect on antagonist potency at homomeric GluR1 receptors but led to a significant decrease in the voltage-dependence. In conclusion, PhTX-56 is a novel, very potent, and selective antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and is a promising tool for structure/function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL680869,20181017,10598970|14608128|44368884|44368885|44368886|44368895|44368910|44369047|44369048|44369061|44369062|44369077|44369235|44369248|44369251|44369283|44369293|44369295|44369306|44369308,103242301|103395119|103401345|103401346|103401347|103401358|103401386|103401656|103401657|103401689|103401691|103401729|103402004|103402031|103402035|103402084|103402111|103402115|103402135|103402137,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477358,0,,P42261,,129148.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

1329851,Literature-derived,Activity at ionotropic glutamate receptor 1 (unknown origin),"Title: Novel bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane analogs as antagonists of metabotropic glutamate 2/3 receptors for the treatment of depression._||_Abstract: Negative modulators of metabotropic glutamate 2 & 3 receptors demonstrate antidepressant-like activity in animal models and hold promise as novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Herein we describe our efforts to prepare and optimize a series of conformationally constrained 3,4-disubstituted bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane glutamic acid analogs as orthosteric (glutamate site) mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists. This work led to the discovery of a highly potent and efficacious tool compound 18 (hmGlu2 IC50 46±14.2nM, hmGlu3 IC50=46.1±36.2nM). Compound 18 showed activity in the mouse forced swim test with a minimal effective dose (MED) of 1mg/kg ip. While in rat EEG studies it exhibited wake promoting effects at 3 and 10mg/kg ip without any significant effects on locomotor activity. Compound 18 thus represents a novel tool molecule for studying the impact of blocking mGlu2/3 receptors both in vitro and in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3869547,20200624,57338826,374326987,2890,,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27836401,0,,P42261,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
