267498,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to AMPA receptor,"Title: (R)-3'-(3-methylbenzo[b]thiophen-5-yl)spiro[1-azabicyclo[2,2,2]octane-3,5'-oxazolidin]-2'-one, a novel and potent alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist displays cognitive enhancing properties._||_Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play important roles in learning and memory. Herein, we describe our research of the structure-activity relationships (SAR) in a series of (S)-spiro[1-azabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-3,5'-oxazolidin]-2'-ones bearing various bicyclic moieties to discover novel alpha7 receptor agonists. Through a number of SAR studies on the series, we have found out that inhibition of CYP 2D6 isozyme, which was a primary obstacle for the previously identified compound, was avoidable by the introduction of bicyclic moieties. Chemical optimization of the series led to the identification of a novel and potent alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist 23. This compound not only possessed high binding affinity (K(i) = 3 nmol/L) toward the alpha7 receptor but also showed agonistic activity even at a concentration of 0.1 micromol/L. In addition, compound 23 improved cognition in several rat models, which might suggest the potential of the alpha7 receptor partial agonist for the treatment of neurological disorders including cognitive dysfunction.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL869743,20181020,71450922,163316016,2890|2891|2892|2893,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16821797,0,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0
163313,Literature-derived,Inhibitory activity against Quisqualate receptor using [3H]AMPA at 10e5 (M),"Title: Novel selective and partial agonists of 5-HT3 receptors. Part 1. Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists. One of them, 13a, has shown in vivo at very low dose a potent anxiolytic-like activity in the light/dark test.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL766504,20181015,9863146,103237550,2890|2891|2892|2893,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8642566,0,,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0
