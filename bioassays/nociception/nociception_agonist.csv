On the contrary, analogues cyclized at the C-terminal parts by the disulfide linkages at positions 6-10, 7-11, 7-14, and 10-14 sustained relatively high potencies in both assays. Notably, cyclo[Cys(10), Cys(14)]NC(1-14)-NH(2) (12) was found to be a potent NC agonist nearly as active as the parent peptide or NC. The maximum efficacy (Emax) of the C-terminally cyclized analogues and their linear counterparts in the GTP gamma S functional assay showed more than 94% (vs NC as 100%), suggesting that these analogues are full agonists.

Biological examination of peptides 10-13 showed two new antagonists (10 and 12) exhibiting increased selectivity for the ORL1 receptor.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754585,20181017,5311340|16131448|44366689|44366690|44366822|44366823|73354624,103383609|103396494|103396495|103396704|103396705|103532611|174515855,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12431062,0,,P41146,,206.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0
148870,Confirmatory,Affinity for human Opioid receptor like 1 (ORL-1) expressed in HEK293 cells,"Title: Novel, potent ORL-1 receptor agonist peptides containing alpha-Helix-promoting conformational constraints._||_Abstract: The ORL-1 receptor has recently been cloned and is implicated in a wide variety of physiological and pathophysiological processes. Toward the goal of elucidating important features of the receptor-bound conformation of the endogenous ligand, nociceptin (NC), several conformationally constrained analogues were prepared. Either alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (Aib) or N-methylalanine (MeAla) were inserted as replacement(s) for Ala7, Ala11, or Ala15 in the native NC sequence (FGGFTGARKSARKLANQ). In vitro assays measuring human ORL-1 receptor affinity (competition binding against [3H] NC), functional potency ([35S]GTP gamma S), and efficacy (as compared to NC) were performed for each new peptide. The receptor affinities of the Aib-containing peptides generally matched NC, showing K(i)'s in the range of 0.1-0.5 nM. By comparison, the receptor affinities of the MeAla-containing peptides were significantly diminished. Peptide 14 (FGGFTG[Aib]RKS[Aib]RKLANQ-NH2), which contains two constrained alanine residues (positions 7 and 11) and a C-terminal amide modification, was found to be a very potent agonist with K(i) = 0.05 nM and EC50 = 0.08 nM in the human ORL-1 assays. The data support a hypothesis that the receptor-bound form of NC might adopt an amphipathic helix in the 'address' segment of the sequence.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754586,20181017,16131448|44365971|44365972|44365986|44366123|44366146|44366147|44366148|44366170|44366241|44366242|44366311|44366312|44366454,103394783|103394784|103394833|103395256|103395293|103395294|103395295|103395349|103395536|103395537|103395696|103395697|103396041|103532611,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12431054,0,,P41146,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process. We believe that this is one of the first examples for a Phase III drug candidate that was discovered and optimized, from start to finish, using in silico model-based methods as the primary tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL862260,20181020,9851104|11430856,103488450|103570372,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16722631,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

The crucial reaction step in the chiral pool synthesis was the establishment of the three carbon bridge by a Dieckmann analogous cyclization of the allyl and propyl derivatives 6 and 7 to yield the mixed methyl silyl acetals 8 and 9, respectively. Stereoselective Grignard reaction, dehydration, and introduction of the pharmacophoric (N,N-diethylcarbamoylbenzyl) residue led to the designed delta receptor agonists 3, ent-3, and 20 with a double bond in the bicyclic framework. Hydrogenation of the allyl derivative 14 was performed with ammonium formate and Pd/C to yield the saturated ligands 24a and 24b. Removal of the allyl substituent with RhCl(3), hydrogenation of the ring system, and re-attachment of the allyl moiety provided the allyl derivatives 4a and 4b. In receptor binding studies with the radioligand [(3)H]-deltorphine II only ent-3 showed considerable delta receptor affinity (K(i)=740 nM).

The compounds were evaluated in a mammalian cell-based functional assay and in radioligand binding assays expressing recombinant human cannabinoid receptors (CB1 and CB2). In general, all of the compounds exhibited high binding selectivity at CB1 vs CB2 and the general SAR revealed a lead compound 11-(4-chlorophenyl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine-8-carboxylic acid butylamide (12e) which showed excellent in vivo activity in pharmacodynamic models related to CB1 receptor activity. The low solubility that hampered the development of 12e was solved leading to a potential preclinical candidate 11-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)dibenzo[b,f][1,4]thiazepine-8-carboxylic acid butylamide (12h).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1000195,20180910,16049170|42596959|42617993,103652268|103652335|103652395,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19338356,0,,P41146,,,,,0,0,1,0,0,0

This synergistic outcome has been suggested to be due to the interaction with the receptor aromatic and/or acidic amino acid residues crucial to receptor activation. In order to identify such receptor residues in the second ORL1 extracellular loop, we prepared a series of recombinant mutant receptors. The mutant receptor Gln205Ala was found to be as active as wild-type ORL1 for both nociceptin and [Arg(14),Lys(15)]nociceptin. In contrast, Asp206Ala and Tyr207Ala exhibited considerably reduced activity for [Arg(14),Lys(15)]nociceptin, exhibiting no synergistic activity enhancement. These results suggest that Asp206 and Tyr207 are directly involved in the interaction with nociceptin-[Arg(14),Lys(15)]. Trp208Ala was found to bind strongly both nociceptin and [Arg(14),Lys(15)]nociceptin, although it elicited no biological activity. All these results indicate that the consecutive amino acid residues Asp206, Tyr207, and Trp208 are critical to the activation of the ORL1 receptor, but not to nociceptin-binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1072713,20180912,16131448,103532611,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19879767,0,,P41146,,207.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,0

Endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor [or opioid-receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor] are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the immune systems, and peripheral organs, and have a crucial role in the pain sensory system.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1763211,20200629,5311340|10763594|11191683|11411841|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915143|52915144|52915145|52915146|52915147|52915266|52915267|52915268|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916174|52916266|52916267|52916358|52916359|52916360|52916470|52916471|52916472|52916597|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|103577713|131271836|131271837|131271838|131271839|131271840|131271841|131273789|131273790|131275837|131275838|131275839|131275840|131275841|131277781|131277782|131277783|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277787|131277788|131277789|131279872|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281857|131281858|131281859|131281860|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283860|131283861|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131285841|131285842|131287148,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,,P41146,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Herein, we describe the discovery and development of an antagonist NOP receptor occupancy (RO) tracer and a novel positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand suitable to probe the NOP receptor in human clinical studies. A thorough structure-activity relationship (SAR) around the high-affinity 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2-(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold identified a series of subnanomolar, highly selective NOP antagonists. Subsequently, these unlabeled NOP ligands were evaluated in vivo by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in rat to determine brain uptake, kinetics and specific binding. (S)-27 was identified as a suitable unlabeled preclinical RO tracer to accurately quantify NOP receptor engagement in rat brain.

The three radioligands, [(11)C](S)-10a-c, gave similar results. Baseline scans showed high entry of radioactivity into the brain to give a distribution reflecting that expected for NOP receptors. Preblock experiments showed high early peak levels of brain radioactivity, which rapidly declined to a much lower level than seen in baseline scans, thereby indicating a high level of receptor-specific binding in baseline experiments.

The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest.

N/OFQ and NOP receptor have important roles on a variety of physiological, pathophysiological, regulatory, and dysregulatory mechanisms in the living body. Both activation and blockade of NOP receptor function have displayed clinical potential of NOP receptor agonists and antagonists for the treatment of various diseases or pathophysiological conditions, respectively. Potent and selective NOP receptor agonists/antagonists are also useful tools to investigate the various mechanisms mediated by NOP receptor-N/OFQ system. As the present study, a series of (4-arylpiperidine substituted-methyl)-[bicyclic (hetero)cycloalkanobenzene] analogs was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated in vitro to seek and identify potent and selective, small-molecules of nonpeptide NOP receptor antagonists, which resulted in the discovery of novel potent small-molecule 15 with high human NOP receptor selectivity over human μ receptor.
