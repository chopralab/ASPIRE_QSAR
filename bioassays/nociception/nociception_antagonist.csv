After a 4-aminoquinoline derivative was found to bind with the human ORL(1) receptor, a series of 4-aminoquinolines and related compounds were synthesized and their binding was evaluated. Elucidation of structure-activity relationships eventually led to the optimum compounds. One of these compounds, N-(4-amino-2-methylquinolin-6-yl)-2-(4-ethylphenoxymethyl)benzamide hydrochloride (11) not only antagonized nociceptin-induced allodynia in mice but also showed analgesic effect in a hot plate test using mice and in a formalin test using rats.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1763211,20200629,5311340|10763594|11191683|11411841|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915143|52915144|52915145|52915146|52915147|52915266|52915267|52915268|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916174|52916266|52916267|52916358|52916359|52916360|52916470|52916471|52916472|52916597|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|103577713|131271836|131271837|131271838|131271839|131271840|131271841|131273789|131273790|131275837|131275838|131275839|131275840|131275841|131277781|131277782|131277783|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277787|131277788|131277789|131279872|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281857|131281858|131281859|131281860|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283860|131283861|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131285841|131285842|131287148,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,,P41146,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

High-affinity NOP ligands were synthesized based on a 3-(2'-fluoro-4',5'-dihydrospiro[piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran]-1-yl)-2(2-halobenzyl)-N-alkylpropanamide scaffold and from experimental screens in rats, with ex vivo LC-MS/MS measures, three ligands were identified for labeling with carbon-11 and evaluation with PET in monkey. Each ligand was labeled by (11)C-methylation of an N-desmethyl precursor and studied in monkey under baseline and NOP receptor-preblock conditions. The three radioligands, [(11)C](S)-10a-c, gave similar results. Baseline scans showed high entry of radioactivity into the brain to give a distribution reflecting that expected for NOP receptors. Preblock experiments showed high early peak levels of brain radioactivity, which rapidly declined to a much lower level than seen in baseline scans, thereby indicating a high level of receptor-specific binding in baseline experiments. Overall, [(11)C](S)-10c showed the most favorable receptor-specific signal and kinetics and is now selected for evaluation in human subjects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2215338,20180924,10047612|52951674|52951675|52951807|52951808|52951809|52951810|52951938|52951939|52951940|52951941|52951942|52952043,103683969|160670437|160670438|160675773|160691899|160697312|160697313|163315080|163315081|163318560|163322034|163328847|163335817,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21438532,0,,P41146,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,0,1,0,1

Recently, clinical proof-of-concept was achieved for the treatment of primary insomnia using dual (OX1R/OX2R) orexin receptor antagonists. However, elucidation of the pharmacology associated with selective orexin-2 receptor antagonists (2-SORAs) has been hampered by the lack of orally bioavailable, highly selective small molecule probes. Herein, the discovery and optimization of a novel series of 2,5-diarylnicotinamides as potent and orally bioavailable orexin-2 receptor selective antagonists is described. A compound from this series demonstrated potent sleep promotion when dosed orally to EEG telemetrized rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3102523,20180928,25060119,194159569,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24215892,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ). Moreover, these compounds exhibit sufficient bioavailability to produce a high level of NOP receptor occupancy in the brain following oral administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3243886,20200619,16131448|58268566|90654745|90654746|90654747|90654748|90654749|90654750|90654751|90654752|90654753|90654754|90654755|90654756|90654757|90654758|90654759,103532611|242623262|242623263|242623264|242623265|242623266|242623267|242623268|242623269|242623270|242623271|242623272|242623273|242623274|242623275|242623276|242623277,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24678969,0,,P41146,9606.0,197.0,,,0,0,1,0,1,0

However, there is substantial interest in its activities at the kappa opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptors.

N/OFQ and NOP receptor have important roles on a variety of physiological, pathophysiological, regulatory, and dysregulatory mechanisms in the living body. Both activation and blockade of NOP receptor function have displayed clinical potential of NOP receptor agonists and antagonists for the treatment of various diseases or pathophysiological conditions, respectively. Potent and selective NOP receptor agonists/antagonists are also useful tools to investigate the various mechanisms mediated by NOP receptor-N/OFQ system. As the present study, a series of (4-arylpiperidine substituted-methyl)-[bicyclic (hetero)cycloalkanobenzene] analogs was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated in vitro to seek and identify potent and selective, small-molecules of nonpeptide NOP receptor antagonists, which resulted in the discovery of novel potent small-molecule 15 with high human NOP receptor selectivity over human μ receptor.

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies.

This research spawned an explosion of small-molecule NOP receptor ligands from discovery programs in major pharmaceutical companies. NOP agonists have been investigated for their efficacy in preclinical models of anxiety, cough, substance abuse, pain (spinal and peripheral), and urinary incontinence, whereas NOP antagonists have been investigated for treatment of pain, depression, and motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.
