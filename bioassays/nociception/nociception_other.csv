The addition of fluorine to the Phe(4) or the insertion of a further pair of basic amino acids Arg(14)-Lys(15) generate potent agonists. On the basis of these findings, we combined in the N/OFQ-NH(2) template the chemical modifications Arg(14)-Lys(15) and (pF)Phe(4) that increase the agonist potency with those conferring partial agonist (Phe(1)Psi(CH(2)NH)Gly(2)) or pure antagonist (Nphe(1)) properties. Twelve peptides were synthesized and pharmacologically evaluated in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human recombinant NOP and in electrically stimulated mouse vas deferens and guinea pig ileum assays. All peptides behaved as NOP ligands; the chemical modifications Arg(14)-Lys(15) and (pF)Phe(4) increased ligand affinity/potency. Peptides with the normal Phe(1)-Gly(2) peptide bond behaved as full agonists, and those with the Phe(1)Psi(CH(2)NH)Gly(2) modification behaved as partial agonists, while those with the Nphe(1) modification behaved as partial agonists or pure antagonists depending on the presence or absence of the (pF)Phe(4) modification, respectively. The full agonist [(pF)Phe(4),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2), the partial agonist [Phe(1)Psi(CH(2)NH)Gly(2),(pF)Phe(4),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2), and the pure antagonist [Nphe(1),Arg(14),Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) represent the most potent peptide ligands for NOP.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL834720,20200703,16131448|44327446|44327819|44388460|44388461|44388462|44388465|44388466|44388467|44388472|44388473|44388474,103307743|103308378|103441633|103441634|103441635|103441642|103441643|103441644|103441651|103441652|103441653|103532611,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15743186,0,,P41146,,197.0,,,1,0,1,1,1,1

Ac-RYYRIK-NH(2) is a hexapeptide isolated from the peptide library as an antagonist that inhibits the nociceptin activities mediated through ORL1. However, the structural elements required for this antagonist activity are still indeterminate. In the present study, we evaluated the importance of the acetyl-methyl group in receptor binding and activation, examining the peptides acyl-RYYRIK-NH(2), where acyl (R-CO) possesses a series of alkyl groups, R=C(n)H(2n+1) (n=0-5). The isovaleryl derivative with the C(4)H(9) (=(CH(3))(2)CHCH(2)-) group was found to reveal a high receptor-binding affinity and a strong antagonist nature. This peptide achieved a primary goal of eliminating the agonist activity of Ac-RYYRIK-NH(2) and producing pure antagonist activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL930558,20181023,44456028,103575405,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18068993,0,,P41146,9606.0,207.0,,,1,0,1,1,1,1

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain. These data demonstrate that acute and selective pharmacological blockade of Na(v)1.8 sodium channels in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL935653,20181023,16038374,103558202,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17483457,0,,P41146,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

163,350957,Literature-derived,Inhibition of ORL1 receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022877,20180910,17758320,103530856,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,,P41146,,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1764077,20200629,5311340|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915143|52915144|52915145|52915146|52915147|52915266|52915267|52915268|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916174|52916266|52916267|52916358|52916359|52916360|52916470|52916471|52916472|52916597|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|131271836|131271837|131271838|131271839|131271840|131271841|131273789|131273790|131275837|131275838|131275839|131275840|131275841|131277781|131277782|131277783|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277787|131277788|131277789|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281857|131281858|131281859|131281860|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283861|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131285841|131285842|131287148,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,,P41146,9606.0,45.0,,,0,0,1,1,1,1

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041180,20200621,72771081,242581035,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396143,20210302,155565189,440218835,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

In the current study, the p53 protein reactivator CP-31398 was tested against a panel of kinases on the assumption that it was structurally similar to other active inhibitors. Although it was found to be active in the enzyme-based assay, this compound did not block the proliferation of cancer cells at a feasible concentration level. The styrylquinazoline was used to design new structures that might be potential multitarget inhibitors. Subsequently, a series of compounds was obtained and characterized. Their inhibitory activity in a panel of tyrosine kinases had an antiproliferative effect against several cancer cell lines that have different expression levels of those proteins. The mode of protein interaction was tested for the most active compound in docking experiments.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4412222,20210302,9848110,440127500,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30562697,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,0,0,0,0,0,0

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.
