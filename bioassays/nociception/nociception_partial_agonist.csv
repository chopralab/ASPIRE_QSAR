Activation of nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide (NOP) receptors has been postulated to account for certain aspects of buprenorphine's behavioral profile. In order to investigate the role of NOP activation further, a series of buprenorphine analogues has been synthesized with the aim of increasing affinity for the NOP receptor. Binding and functional assay data on these new compounds indicate that the area around C20 in the orvinols is key to NOP receptor activity, with several compounds displaying higher affinity than buprenorphine. One compound, 1b, was found to be a mu opioid receptor partial agonist of comparable efficacy to buprenorphine but with higher efficacy at NOP receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1838552,20180919,105104|5462471|9848990|16131448|44299404|54756989|54756990|56658044|56661555|56664973|56668405|56681954|56681955,103177815|103217856|103243877|103532611|134434452|134438317|134442153|134442154|134445998|134457609|134461397|134461398|175265278,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21866885,0,,P41146,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

Starting from 2-benzyl-imidazoline screening hits, a series of structurally related 2-benzyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazoles was investigated first, but it proved highly challenging to obtain compounds having sufficient selectivity against the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor. This issue could be successfully addressed by modification of the linker region and SAR exploration led to the discovery of highly selective isopropyl-substituted 4-aminomethyl-imidazole compounds. The work culminated in the identification of the selective TAAR1 partial agonist RO5073012 (4-chlorophenyl)-(1H-imidazol-4-ylmethyl)-isopropyl-amine, 24), which has a good pharmacokinetic profile after oral administration in rodents. RO5073012 has been found to be active in a behavioural rat model which is considered indicative for schizophrenia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2212552,20180924,24781869,163329089,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22795332,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,0,0

The reaction of imines, derived from the opioid ligands oxymorphone and naltrexone, with Michael acceptors leads to pyridomorphinans with structures similar to known pyrrolo- and indolomorphinans. One of the synthesized compounds, 5e, derived from oxymorphone had substantial agonist activity at delta opioid receptors but not at mu and/or kappa opioid receptors and in that sense profiled as a selective delta opioid receptor agonist. The pyridomorphinans derived from naltrexone and naloxone were all found to be non-selective potent antagonists and as such could have utility as treatments for alcohol abuse.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3361834,20181005,118705898|118705899|118705901,312346071|312346072|312346074,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24973818,0,,P41146,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

Nociceptin (orphanin FQ) is an endogenous peptide ligand that binds to ORL-1, however it does not bind the classical δ, μ and κ opioid receptors with high affinity. The synthesis of 1 involved using a molecular diversity approach, to rapidly advance a library of compounds for biological testing.

However, there is substantial interest in its activities at the kappa opioid and nociceptin/orphanin FQ peptide receptors. This has led to an interest in developing compounds with a buprenorphine-like pharmacological profile but with lower efficacy at mu opioid receptors. The present article describes aryl ring analogues of buprenorphine in which the standard C20-methyl group has been moved to the C7β position, resulting in ligands with the desired profile. In particular, moving the methyl group has resulted in far more robust kappa opioid antagonist activity than seen in the standard orvinol series. Of the compounds synthesized, a number, including 15a, have a profile of interest for the development of drug abuse relapse prevention therapies or antidepressants and others (e.g., 8c), as analgesics with a reduced side-effect profile.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3583932,20200624,9848990|71229805|71230446|81689704|122179050|122179051|122179052|122179053|122179055|122179056|122179057|122179058|122179059|122179060|122179061|122179063|122179064,175265278|242635309|318373626|318373627|318373628|318373630|318373637|318373638|318373639|318373640|318373641|318373642|318373643|318373644|318373647|318373648|318373649,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25898137,0,,P41146,9606.0,45.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

These shifts in functional activity are often accompanied by negligible changes in binding affinity. The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest. An improved understanding of specific structural modifications that are likely to alter the functional activity of a GPCR ligand may be of use to researchers designing GPCR-targeted drugs and/or probe compounds, specifically in cases where a particular ligand exhibits good potency but not the preferred functional activity at the GPCR of choice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3777306,20180905,3655995|9905428|10020165,103316798|103316904|103317714,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26390077,0,,P41146,9606.0,,,,1,0,1,0,1,0

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies. Compounds 4, 5, and 9 with agonist efficacies between 25% and 35% significantly attenuated motor deficits in the 6-OHDA-hemilesioned rat model of PD. Further, unlike NOP antagonists, which appear to worsen dyskinesia expression, these NOP partial agonists did not attenuate or worsen dyskinesia expression. The NOP partial agonists and their SAR reported here may be useful to develop nondopaminergic treatments for PD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4358236,20210302,129188443|129188454|129188459|134563466|134563496|134563500|134563650|134563655|134563691|134563695|134563698|134563699|134578342|134578456|134578457|134578506|134578518|155521553|155531153|155542684|155569552,440110454|440115097|440115190|440126636|440133117|440136676|440141305|440142556|440148878|440148951|440159141|440160200|440162310|440169390|440182810|440184332|440199118|440212705|440227556|440228000|440229969,4987,,P41146,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31951130,0,,P41146,9606.0,197.0,,,1,0,1,0,1,0
