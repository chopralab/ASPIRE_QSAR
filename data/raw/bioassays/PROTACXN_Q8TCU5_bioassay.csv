143450,Confirmatory,In vitro binding affinity against N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor using [3H]-CPG 39653 as radioligand,"Title: Heteroaryl analogues of AMPA. Synthesis and quantitative structure-activity relationships._||_Abstract: A number of 3-isoxazolol bioisosteres, 7a-i, of (S)-glutamic acid (Glu), in which the methyl group of (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA, 1) was replaced by different 5-membered heterocyclic rings, were synthesized. Comparative in vitro pharmacological studies on this series of AMPA analogues were performed using receptor binding assays (IC50 values) and the electrophysiological rat cortical slice model (EC50 values). None of these compounds showed detectable affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subtype of Glu receptors. Some of the compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H]kainic acid binding. The inhibitory effects on [3H]AMPA binding and agonist potencies at AMPA receptors of 7a-i were strictly dependent on the structure, electrostatic potential, and methyl substitution of the heterocyclic 5-substituent. Thus, while 7a (IC50 = 0.094 microM; EC50 = 2.3 microM) was approximately equipotent with AMPA (IC50 = 0.023 microM; EC50 = 5.4 microM), (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)isoxazol-4-yl]propio nic acid (7b) (IC50 = 48 microM; EC50 = 550 microM) was some 2 orders of magnitude weaker than AMPA, and (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-isoxazol-4 -yl] propionic acid (7c) (IC50 > 100 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive. Furthermore, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7i) (IC50 = 0.030 microM; EC50 = 0.92 microM) was more potent than AMPA, whereas its N-1 methyl isomer, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7h) (IC50 = 54 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive as an AMPA agonist. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed a positive correlation between receptor affinity, electrostatic potential near the nitrogen atom at the 'ortho' position of the heterocyclic 5-substituent, and the rotational energy barrier around the bond connecting the two rings. We envisage that a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group and an ortho-positioned heteroatom of the ring substituent at the 5-position stabilize receptor-active conformations of these AMPA analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751682,20181015,1221|3481675|10562939|10610792|10658567|10729534|10752476|10800053|10823814|10824747,103174429|103289365|103309919|103309920|103310042|103310043|103310045|103310166|103310208|103310209,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,In vitro,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9288165,0,NULL,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,NULL,NULL,,NULL

143460,Literature-derived,Inhibition of [3H]L-glutamate binding to NMDA receptor of central nervous system,"Title: Phosphinic acid analogues of GABA. 2. Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists. One of them, 13a, has shown in vivo at very low dose a potent anxiolytic-like activity in the light/dark test.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872763,20181015,9863146,103237550,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,NULL,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8642566,0,NULL,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A key step in the synthesis is the stereoselective reductive amination of the ketones 9, 18, and 19 with pyrrolidine and NaBH(3)CN, which succeeds only in the presence of the Lewis acid Ti(OiPr)(4). Whereas the BOC-substituted ketone 9 affords the unlike and like diastereomers of 10 in a ratio of 70:30, the diastereoselectivity during the reductive amination of the butyl and phenyl substituted ketones 18 and 19 is enhanced to 85:15 (butyl derivative) and >95:<5 (phenyl derivative) in favor of the unlike diastereomers. In receptor binding studies using the radioligand [(3)H]U-69,593 the (S,S)-configured methyl carbamate (S,S)-14 reveals the highest kappa-receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.31 nM) within this series, even exceeding the lead kappa-agonist 6 (GR-89,696).

Since the three-dimensional (3D) structure of this ion channel is unknown, the structural requirements for uncompetitive inhibition were investigated by application of a three-step strategy: At first, Ki values were measured for a number of structurally diverse compounds at the phencyclidine (PCP) binding site in postmortem human frontal cortex. Second, a pharmacophore model was developed for this set of molecules employing a mathematical method called graph theory. The resulting pharmacophore provided a very good explanation for the ability of structurally diverse compounds to bind to the same binding site. Using the experimental data and the pharmacophore as a basis for the third step, a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) applying comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) was performed. The QSAR proved to be highly consistent and showed good predictiveness for several additional molecules. The results give a deeper insight into the structural requirements for effective NMDA receptor antagonism and offer the opportunity for improved drug design. The study represents the first quantitative 3D-QSAR model for NMDA receptor blockade, and it comprises structurally very different molecules. That the alignment for a highly consistent CoMFA is based on an automated 3D pharmacophore analysis has important methodological implications.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL761030,20181016,2130|3821|4054|4601|4919|6468|19476|19478|35998|64245|64352|68778|86625|180081|3010129|5100144|5276622|5276624|5276625|5360696|5360697|10013264|10220703|10242135|15917395|44352415,103168867|103189283|103193630|103199488|103211988|103234890|103235190|103362353|103362427|103362736|103362807|103362985|103363016|103363150|103363159|103363160|103363300|103363320|103363345|103363366|103363380|103363398|103363421|103363453|123086250|123087813,2902|2903|2904|2905|2906|116443|116444,NULL,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9464369,0,NULL,O15399|O60391|Q05586|Q12879|Q13224|Q14957|Q8TCU5,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A number of DTG analogues were synthesized and evaluated in in vitro radioligand displacement experiments with guinea pig brain membrane homogenates, using the highly sigma-specific radioligands [3H]-3 and [3H]-(+)-3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-N-(1-propyl)piperidine and the phencyclidine (PCP) receptor specific compounds [3H]-N-[1-(2-thienyl)-cyclohexyl]piperidine and [3H]-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10- imine. The affinity of N,N'-diarylguanidines for the sigma receptor decreases with increasing steric bulk of ortho substituents larger than C2H5. Hydrophobic substituents are generally preferred over similarly positioned hydrophilic ones. Furthermore, electroneutral substituents are preferred over strongly electron donating or withdrawing groups. Significant binding to the sigma receptor is usually retained as long as at least one side of the guanidine bears a preferred group (e.g. 2-CH3C6H5). Replacement of one or both aryl rings with certain saturated carbocycles (e.g. cyclohexyl, norbornyl, or adamantyl) leads to a significant increase in affinity. By combining the best aromatic and best saturated carbocyclic substituents in the same molecule, we arrived at some of the most potent sigma ligands described to date (e.g. N-exo-2-norbornyl-N'-(2-iodophenyl)guanidine, IC50 = 3 nM vs [3H]-3). All of the compounds tested were several orders of magnitude more potent at the sigma receptor than at the PCP receptor, with a few notable exceptions.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists.

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants.

Starting from 2-benzyl-imidazoline screening hits, a series of structurally related 2-benzyl- and 4-benzyl-imidazoles was investigated first, but it proved highly challenging to obtain compounds having sufficient selectivity against the adrenergic alpha 2 receptor.

This was done by correlating structural and physicochemical descriptors obtained from computation software with the experimentally observed [(3)H]MK-801 displacement ability of a small library of synthesized and in vitro screened arylidenaminoguanidines. Results for the generated PLS model were r(2)=0.814, rmsd=0.208, rCV(2)=0.714, loormsd=0.261. The ANN model was created utilizing the eleven descriptors from the PLS model for comparison. The quality of the ANN model (r(2)=0.828, rmsd=0.200, rCV(2)=0.721, loormsd=0.257) is similar to the PLS model, and indicates that the feature between the inputs and the output is majorly linear.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors.

Compounds ZL0420 (28) and ZL0454 (35) were identified as potent and selective BRD4 inhibitors with nanomolar binding affinities to bromodomains (BDs) of BRD4. Both of them can be well docked into the acetyl-lysine (KAc) binding pocket of BRD4, forming key interactions including the critical hydrogen bonds with Asn140 directly and Tyr97 indirectly via a H2O molecule. Both compounds 28 and 35 exhibited submicromolar potency of inhibiting the TLR3-dependent innate immune gene program, including ISG54, ISG56, IL-8, and Groβ genes in cultured human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs).

The structure activity relationship (SAR) for mGluR2 and mGluR4 are distinct: the compounds which select for mGluR2 all contain fluorine on the N-6 aryl group. Furthermore, the [3,4-d]s in this study showed no significant binding at inhibitory GABAA, nor excitatory NMDA receptors, and previously we had disclosed that they lack significant activity at the System Xc-Antiporter.

Unfortunately, D4 antagonists that were developed for schizophrenia failed in the clinic. Thus, D4 fell out of favor as a therapeutic target, and work in this area was silent for decades. Recently, D4 ligands with improved selectivity for D4 against not only D1-3,5 but also other biogenic amine targets have emerged, and D4 is once again in the spotlight as a novel target for both addiction and Parkinson's disease (PD), as well as other emerging diseases.

The MTT cytotoxicity assay results showed the SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to be viable with the twelve compounds, particularly at concentrations less than 10 μM. The compounds also showed significant neuroprotective activity, ranging from 31% to 61% at 1 μM, when assayed on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells in which neurodegeneration was induced by MPP<sup>+</sup>. Calcium regulation assays conducted on the same cell line showed the compounds to be significant VGCC blockers with activity ranging from 26.6% to 51.3% at 10 μM; as well as significant NMDAr antagonists with compound 5 showing the best activity of 88.3% at 10 μM. When assayed on human MAO isoenzymes, most of the compounds showed significant inhibitory activity, with compound 5 showing the best activity (MAO-B: IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.70 μM).
