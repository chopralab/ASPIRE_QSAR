Selected structural modifications are made to the basic moiety and at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-positions on the piperidine nucleus to enable structure-activity relationships to be delineated. As a result, some highly potent and selective kappa-receptor agonists have been identified.

The 8-amino group was hypothesized to be a replacement for the prototypic 8-OH substituent for 2,6-methano-3-benzazocines and related opiates. This OH group is generally required for binding yet is implicated in unfavorable pharmacokinetic characteristics such as low oral bioavailability and rapid clearance via O-glucuronidation.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

Andrews analysis of the NIH nonpeptide lead SNC-80 suggested the removal of substituents not predicted to contribute to binding. This approach led to a simplified lead, N, N-diethyl-4-[phenyl(1-piperazinyl)methyl]benzamide (1), which retained potent binding affinity and selectivity to the human delta receptor (IC(50) = 11 nM, mu/delta = 740, kappa/delta > 900) and potency as a full agonist (EC(50) = 36 nM) but had a markedly reduced molecular weight, only one chiral center, and increased in vitro metabolic stability. From this lead, the key pharmacophore groups for delta receptor affinity and activation were more clearly defined by SAR and mutagenesis studies. Further structural modifications on the basis of 1 confirmed the importance of the N, N-diethylbenzamide group and the piperazine lower basic nitrogen for delta binding, in agreement with mutagenesis data. A number of piperazine N-alkyl substituents were tolerated.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755693,20181016,44324361,103301050,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751034,20181016,5480230|10677974|44306867|44324324|44324339|44324361|44324362,103241617|103259212|103300947|103301007|103301050|103301051|103698780,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells.

Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL747233,20181017,443408|5480230|10349271|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734669|103734675|103735456,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,NULL,P41145,9527,207,,NULL

Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872672,20181017,10349271,103734669,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,NULL,P41145,9527,207,,NULL

Their biological activities were determined in the three bioassays [guinea pig ileum (GPI), mouse vas deferens (MVD), and rabbit vas deferens (RVD)] and in the mouse tail-pinch test after intravenous administration. Some analogues that showed interesting activity in the bioassays and/or in the analgesic tests were further characterized in mu-, delta-, and kappa-representative binding assays. The obtained data indicate that modification of the enkephalin segment to give metabolically stable analogues with high affinity and selectivity for the kappa receptor is strictly limited and that introduction of MeArg in position 7 protects the Arg6-Arg-7 bond from enzymatic degradation without potency drop and change of opioid receptor selectivity. [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (18) [IC50 (nM) = 0.3 (GPI), 7.4 (MVD), and 2.6 (RVD); tail pinch ED50 (mg/kg) = 0.75] showed opioid activity similar to that of dynorphin A in the three bioassays and relatively high kappa-receptor selectivity in the binding assays and produced a 2.5-fold more potent analgesic effect than morphine. [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (20) showed a 40-60-fold more potent opioid activity than 18 in the three bioassays and produced a 3.4-fold more potent analgesic effect than 18.

The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752474,20200628,118718756,312365627,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

148708,Confirmatory,Binding affinity against Opioid receptor kappa 1,"Title: Molecular docking reveals a novel binding site model for fentanyl at the mu-opioid receptor._||_Abstract: The ligand binding modes of a series of fentanyl derivatives are examined using a combination of conformational analysis and molecular docking to the mu-opioid receptor. Condensed-phase molecular dynamics simulations are applied to evaluate potential relationships between ligand conformation and fentanyl substitution and to generate probable 'bioactive' structures for the ligand series. Automated docking of the largely populated solution conformers identified a common binding site orientation that places the N-phenethyl group of fentanyl deep in a crevice between transmembrane (TM) helices II and III while the N-phenylpropanamide group projected toward a pocket formed by TM-III, -VI, and -VII domains. An analysis of the binding modes indicates the most potent fentanyl derivatives adopt an extended conformation both in solution and in the bound state, suggesting binding affinity may depend on the conformational preferences of the ligands. The results are consistent with ligand binding data derived from chimeric and mutant receptor studies as well as structure-activity relationship data reported on a wide range of fentanyl analogues. The binding site model is also compared to that of N-phenethylnormorphine. An overlay of the bound conformation of the opiate and cis-3-methylfentanyl shows the N-phenethyl groups occupy equivalent binding domains in the receptor. While the cationic amines of both ligand classes were found docked to an established anchor site (D149 in TM-III), no overlap was observed between the N-phenylpropanamide group and the remaining components of the opiate scaffold. The unique binding mode(s) proposed for the fentanyl series may, in part, explain the difficulties encountered in defining models of recognition at the mu-receptor and suggest opioid receptors may display multiple binding epitopes. Furthermore, the results provide new insight to the design of experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis to the differential selectivities of ligands at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752204,20181017,3345|62156|124716|3041260|9976188|10021831,103173010|103182112|103224159|103349831|103349832|103734588,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10669565,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244.

A specific class of thioureas bearing basic pyrrolidine residues were shown to give good binding affinities. Further alkylation of the pyrrolidine ring with benzyl derivatives also proved to increase the mu binding affinity. In addition, it was demonstrated that mu binding was enhanced by the presence of polar groups around the benzyl ring having hydrogen-bonding character (donor/acceptor).

Systematic exploration of the conformational space of the ligand combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in water revealed consistent conformational preferences for all the kappa-agonists in this series. The results were further compared with available X-ray and 1D- and 2D-NMR data to identify potential 'lead' conformers for molecular docking. Ligand binding modes were initially determined using automated docking of two of the ligands (U50,488 and BRL52,537) to the kappa-opioid receptor. Extrapolation of the predicted binding mode to other members in this ligand series revealed similar docking preferences, with each ligand docked along the receptor helical axis. The binding modes were further refined using MD simulations of the receptor-ligand complexes. The results show a that salt bridge is formed between the amino proton of the ligands and the carboxylate group of Asp138 in TM3. This interaction most likely serves as a key anchoring point for the agonist association. Additional ligand contacts were noted with kappa-specific residues Ile294, Leu295, and Ala298, which may, in part, explain the kappa-selectivity in this series.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists. One of them, 13a, has shown in vivo at very low dose a potent anxiolytic-like activity in the light/dark test.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750579,20181015,9863146,103237550,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8642566,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL
148746,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards Opioid receptor kappa 2,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 1234-1237), the most potent antinociceptive compounds preferred a particular orientation of the phenyl ring.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750587,20181013,12368881,103213625,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1315868,0,NULL,P41145,9913,NULL,,NULL

It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice. Introduction of a 14-phenylpropoxy substituent leads to a profound alteration in the pharmacological profile of this class of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754919,20181017,5748293|44339409|44339472|44339475|44339521,103332294|103332388|103332565|103332568|103332685,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15163203,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

The most striking finding was the very large difference in kappa-opioid receptor activity between the diastereomeric ethyl ethers: 46-fold in binding, 150-fold in GPI, and 900-fold in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay in favor of the (R)-diastereomer. Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact. It appears that kappa-agonist binding of the orvinols avoids the inhibitory site in the intramolecular H-bonded conformation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754921,20181017,49799964|49799966|49799967|49799968|49799969|71450939|71459962|71461673,103770293|103770295|103770296|103770297|103770298|163316075|163333407|163336787,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10794701,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755507,20181016,44306867,103259212,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755509,20181017,3036289|5359966|9804450|9897164|10078468|10462426|11204993|11239327|11262815|11308721|11364225|11434336,103230837|103230838|103393362|103393363|103393415|103393930|103393960|103393961|103394107|103394260|103394266|123099351,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Selected structural modifications are made to the basic moiety and at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-positions on the piperidine nucleus to enable structure-activity relationships to be delineated. As a result, some highly potent and selective kappa-receptor agonists have been identified. In particular, this has been achieved by introduction of oxygen-containing functionality into the 4-position of the piperidine nucleus or the 3-position of the pyrrolidinylmethyl side chain. Thus, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]- 2-[[1-(3-oxopyrrolidinyl)]methyl]piperidine (10) possesses high activity in the rabbit vas deferens (LVD, kappa-specific tissue) (IC50 = 0.20 nM) and is a potent antinociceptive agent, as determined by the mouse acetylcholine-induced abdominal constriction test (MAC) (ED50 = 0.06 mg/kg, sc). The spirocyclic analogue 8-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-7-(1-pyrrolidinylmethyl)-1,4-dio xa-8- azaspirol4.5]decane (39) showed exceptionally potent activity: LVD, IC50 = 0.10 nM; MAC, ED50 = 0.001 mg/kg, sc.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

Evidence for the existence of different mu receptor subtypes in different tissues._||_Abstract: A series of beta-funaltrexamine (2, beta-FNA) analogues (3-14) were synthesized that contain a variety of electrophilic groups attached at the 6 beta-position of the opiate. The opioid agonist and antagonist activities of these ligands were evaluated in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) in vitro assays. Several of the compounds behaved like beta-FNA in that they exhibited reversible agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors and irreversible antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. The rank order of irreversible antagonism for a series of related Michael acceptors did not parallel their intrinsic chemical reactivity, confirming that the degree of covalent binding is in part dependent on the spatial disposition of the electrophilic center relative to the receptor nucleophile (secondary recognition). The maleimidoacetamide 8 behaved very differently from beta-FNA in that it exhibited considerably greater irreversible mu antagonism in MVD relative to the mu blockage in the GPI. This suggests that different proportions of mu receptor subtypes exist in the two tissues. Several of the agents tested, including some nonreactive control compounds, displayed an unusual type of persistent kappa agonist activity in the GPI. This activity, which was reversed by addition of naloxone, reappeared upon washing. Receptor models have been presented to explain this effect. A few of the reactive ligands displayed a true nonreversible kappa agonist activity, suggesting a covalent association with the receptor. Of note in this regard was the propiolamide 6, which appeared to be an irreversible mixed agonist-antagonist at kappa and mu receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL843967,20200628,NULL,103196494,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6090663,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

While all of the ligands were potent reversible agonists in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, most appeared to behave as irreversible antagonists of morphine. The benzyl 5 and phenethyl 6 esters possessed irreversible mu antagonist potency that was of similar magnitude to that of beta-FNA in the GPI.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844966,20200628,46877632,103734688,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849962,20200704,5360515|44297100,103238133|131283791,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats.

231576,Literature-derived,Receptor selectivity index is the ratio of the apparent KI at kappa opioid receptor over the apparent KI at the highest affinity site,"Title: Synthesis and biological activities of dynorphin A analogues with opioid antagonist properties._||_Abstract: Dynorphin A, which displays a wide variety of physiological effects, binds to opioid receptors preferentially at the kappa receptor type. kappa-selective antagonists would be very useful as pharmacological and biochemical probes to study and better understand the action of dynorphin A at its preferred receptor. However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL880986,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL
231670,Literature-derived,Central (GPB) and Peripheral (GPI) Nervous Systems Selectivity at kappa Opioid Receptor,"Title: Design, synthesis, and biological activities of cyclic lactam peptide analogues of dynorphine A(1-11)-NH2._||_Abstract: We previously have reported four possible binding conformation of dynorphin A (Dyn A) for the central kappa opioid receptors, induced by the address sequence, using a molecular mechanics energy minimization approach. The lowest energy conformation was found to exhibit an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence. It was suggested that an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence or a helical conformation induced by the conformational characteristics of the message sequence may be important for binding potency and kappa opioid receptor selectivity. Side chain to side chain lactam bridges between the i and i + 4 positions have been shown to stabilize alpha-helical conformation. Thus, a series of cyclic lactam analogues of dynorphin A(1-11)-NH2 have been designed, synthesized and evaluated by the guinea pig brain (GPB) binding assay and guinea pig ileum (GPI) bioassay to evaluate the conformational analysis prediction and, further, to investigate the conformational requirements for high potency and selectivity for kappa opioid receptors. Positions 2-6, 3-7, and 5-9 were chosen as the sites for incorporating cyclic conformational constraints. Cyclization between D-Asp(2) and Lys(6) in c[D-Asp(2),Lys(6)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to an analogue with pronounced potency and selectivity enhancement for the mu opioid receptor, whereas cyclization between D-Asp(3) and Lys(7) in c[D-Asp(3),Lys(7)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to a potent ligand (IC(50) 4.9 nM) with kappa receptor selectivity. The other analogues in the series proved to be less selective. The biological results led to the suggestion that the binding conformation for the kappa receptor may have structural requirements that are distinct from those of mu and delta receptors. Interestingly, analogues with a D-Asp at position 2, 3, or 9 were found to be more potent for the kappa receptor than analogues with an L-Asp at the same positions. It is suggested that the incorporation of D-Asp into position 2, 3, or 9 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 may have stereochemical and conformational effects on the nearby amino acids which can help discriminate the preference between kappa, mu, and delta receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850950,20181015,10677974|44269673|44269677|44269678|44269681|44269682|44269730|44269731|44269732|44269737|44269750|44269751|44269752,103177263|103177289|103177290|103177300|103177301|103177531|103177532|103177533|103177552|103177607|103177608|103177609|103241617,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8676350,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

231676,Literature-derived,"Ratio between Kappa receptor, Mu receptor and Delta receptor; 1/9/49","Title: [2',6'-Dimethyltyrosine]dynorphin A(1-11)-NH2 analogues lacking an N-terminal amino group: potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists._||_Abstract: Recent studies showed that dermorphin and enkephalin analogues containing two methyl groups at the 2',6'-positions of the Tyr(1) aromatic ring and lacking an N-terminal amino group were moderately potent delta and mu opioid antagonists. These results indicate that a positively charged N-terminal amino group may be essential for signal transduction but not for receptor binding and suggested that its deletion in agonist opioid peptides containing an N-terminal 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) residue may represent a general way to convert them into antagonists. In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group. This was achieved by replacement of Tyr(1) with 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp]. Compounds were tested in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens bioassays and in rat and guinea pig brain membrane receptor binding assays. All analogues turned out to be potent kappa antagonists against Dyn A(1-13) and the non-peptide agonist U50,488 and showed only weak mu and delta antagonist activity. The most potent and most selective kappa antagonist of the series was [(2S)-Mdp(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (5, dynantin), which showed subnanomolar kappa antagonist potency against Dyn A(1-13) and very high kappa selectivity both in terms of its K(e) values determined against kappa, mu, and delta agonists and in terms of its ratios of kappa, mu, and delta receptor binding affinity constants.

In smooth muscle preparations, five members of the series (5a-c,e,f) possessed Ke values in the range 2-15 nM and were delta selective.

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

Molecular modeling indicated a strong structural similarity between the parent of this series and 2-amino-1,1-dimethyl-7-hydroxytetralin. In binding and in vitro functional assays, the aminotetralin derivatives displayed some overlap in SAR with that previously reported for the phenylpiperidine series, providing evidence for a common binding mode for the two series at opioid receptors.

To investigate the importance of the 14-substituent, a series of analogues in which the side chain length is varied and the amide and alkene functions are reduced have been prepared. Binding affinity, particularly at the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), was largely determined by the aromatic group of the side chain. In the [35S]GTPgammaS functional assay, the ligands having a three-carbon side chain were more potent antagonists than their longer chain counterparts, while shorter, two-carbon chain analogues were of higher MOR efficacy, an effect that was confirmed in vivo.

J. Med. Chem. 2006, 25, 7278-7289) new, constrained analogues of the N-phenethyl derivative 3. One of the active constrained analogues, compound 4, exhibited subnanomolar mu-opioid receptor affinity (K(i) = 0.62 nM) and potent mu-opioid antagonist activity (IC(50) = 0.54 nM). On the basis of structure 4, a new series of mu-opioid receptor antagonists were designed. In these compounds the octahydroquinolizine template of 4 was replaced by an octahydro-1H-pyrido[1,2-a]pyrazine scaffold. The new derivatives were tested for their binding affinities and in vitro functional activity against the cloned human mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors. From this study, we identified compound 36, which displays high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor (K(i) = 0.47 nM), potent mu in vitro antagonist activity (IC(50) = 1.8 nM) and improved binding selectivity profile mu/kappa and mu/delta, when compared to 4.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909855,20181021,16094362|16094376|16094382|16094385|16094396|16094409|16094412|16094422|16094423|16094427|16094429|16094431,103503646|103503651|103503652|103503661|103503663|103503669|103503676|103503677|103503702|103503703|103503710|103503717,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149859,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

The activity of salvinorin A is unusual compared to other opioids such as morphine in that it mediates potent kappa opioid receptor signaling yet leads to less receptor downregulation than observed with other kappa agonists. Our initial chemical modifications of salvinorin A have yielded one analogue, herkinorin ( 1c), with high affinity at the microOR. We recently reported that 1c does not promote the recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the microOR or receptor internalization. Here we describe three new derivatives of 1c ( 3c, 3f, and 3i) with similar properties and one, benzamide 7b, that promotes recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the microOR and receptor internalization. When the important role micro opioid receptor regulation plays in determining physiological responsiveness to opioid narcotics is considered, micro opioids derived from salvinorin A may offer a unique template for the development of functionally selective mu opioid receptor-ligands with the ability to produce analgesia while limiting adverse side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL935623,20181023,128563|3036289|5462471|11431898|11561040|11562400|16059781|24829369|24854100|24854177|24854180|24854260|44450499,103217856|103457931|103458205|103498192|103566762|103566802|103566841|103566845|103566928|103567011|103567013|103567054|123099351,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18380425,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1017473,20181024,3037926,103241212,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents.

One approach to better understanding the mode of binding of 1 at kappa receptors is to systematically alter the structure of 1 and examine the effects on opioid receptor affinity and activity. Currently, there is a paucity of methods described for the preparation of analogues derived from 1. Here, we report the investigation of several chemical transformations of 1 isolated from S. divinorum. In particular, this work provides a semisynthesis of salvinicins A (2) and B (3) and has identified 10a as the first neoclerodane diterpene with delta opioid antagonist activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL969925,20200703,128563|11546512,103457931|103497749,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16441078,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL
381428,Literature-derived,Inhibition of kappa opioid dependent ERK1/2 phosphorylation in U50488 treated HEK293 cells expressing GFP tagged kappa opioid receptor,"Title: Long-acting kappa opioid antagonists disrupt receptor signaling and produce noncompetitive effects by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase._||_Abstract: Norbinaltorphimine (NorBNI), guanidinonaltrindole, and atrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine (JDTic) are selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists having very long durations of action in vivo despite binding non-covalently in vitro and having only moderately high affinities. Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14-21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later. Protection by a rapidly cleared reagent indicates that norBNI did not persist at the site of action. In vitro binding of [(3)H]U69,593 to KOR showed that K(d) and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact. Consistent with the concept that the long-lasting effects might be caused by a functional disruption of KOR signaling, both norBNI and JDTic were found to stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing KOR-GFP but not in untransfected cells. Similarly, norBNI increased phospho-JNK in both the striatum and spinal cord in wild type mice but not in KOR knock-out mice. Pretreatment of mice with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 before norBNI attenuated the long acting antagonism. Together, these results suggest that the long duration KOR antagonists disrupt KOR signaling by activating JNK.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL977780,20181025,5480230,103698780,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17702750,0,NULL,P41145,9606,45,,NULL

By quantification of differences in the frequency of occurrence of fragments, similarities between small molecules and their targets can be determined. Naive Bayes models employing fragments provide highly interpretable and reliable means for predicting potency in individual kinases, as demonstrated in retrospective tests and prospective selections that were subsequently screened. Statistical corrections for prospective validation allowed us to accurately estimate success rates in the prospective experiment. Selectivity relationships between kinase targets are substantially explained by differences in the fragment composition of actives. By application of fragment similarities to the broader proteome, it is shown that targets related by sequence exhibit similar fragment preferences in small molecules. Of greater interest, certain targets unrelated by sequence are shown to have similar fragment preferences, even when the chemical similarity of ligands active at each target is low.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL976997,20181025,44577285,103621810,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18386916,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The discoveries of BW373U86 (1) and SNC80 (2) contributed to the rapid expansion of research in this field. However, poor drug-like properties and low therapeutic indices have prevented clinical evaluation of these agents. Doses of 1 and 2 similar to those required for analgesic activity produce convulsions in rodents and nonhuman primates. Recently, we described a novel series of potent, selective, and orally bioavailable delta opioid receptor agonists. The lead derivative, ADL5859 (4), is currently in phase II proof-of-concept studies for the management of pain. Further structure activity relationship exploration has led to the discovery of ADL5747 (36), which is approximately 50-fold more potent than 4 in an animal model of inflammatory pain.

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR. Additionally, data also suggest that increasing the bulk around C(6) may allow control of subtype selectivity within these compound series.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1063597,20180911,44188273|45110000|45269407|45270231|45271055,103683498|103685209|103686977|103688766|103694091,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19364645,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

These compounds are highly potent mu and kappa ligands, e.g., p-methoxyphenylaminocyclorphan showing a K(i) of 0.026 nM at the mu receptor and a K(i) of 0.03 nM at the kappa receptor. Phenyl carbamates and phenylureas were synthesized and investigated. Selective o-formylation of butorphan and levorphanol was achieved. This reaction opened the way to a large set of 2-substituted 3-hydroxymorphinans, including 2-hydroxymethyl-, 2-aminomethyl-, and N-substituted 2-aminomethyl-3-hydroxymorphinans. Bivalent ligands bridged in the 2-position were also synthesized and connected with secondary and tertiary aminomethyl groups, amide bonds, and hydroxymethylene groups, respectively.

These modifications were made mainly on the aryl side of the ester bond to permit possible rapid labeling of the carboxylic acid component with a positron emitter, either carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min), and included (i) replacement of the iodine atom with a small substituent such as nitrile, methyl, or fluoro, (ii) methylation of the 8-amino group, (iii) opening of the dioxan ring, and (iv) alteration of the length of the N-alkyl goup. High-affinity ligands were discovered for recombinant human 5-HT(4) receptors with amenability to labeling with a positron emitter and potential for development as imaging probes.

The secondary amine 10 represents the central building block for the synthesis of more than 25 tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-1-ols. Generally 7-hydroxy derivatives display higher NR2B receptor affinities than the corresponding 7-benzyloxy compounds. A distance of four atoms (five bond lengths) between the basic amino group and the terminal aryl moiety led to highest NR2B affinity. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (WMS-1410, 25) represents the most promising NR2B antagonist of this series showing a K(i)-value of 14nM.

In the key step of the synthesis 2-bromocinnamaldehyde acetal 5 was added to piperidones 6 with various substituents at the N-atom. Unexpectedly, this reaction led to 2-benzoxepines 8, which were contracted with acid to afford the spirocyclic 2-benzofuranacetaldehydes 9. The best yields were obtained, when the transformations up to the alcohols 10 were performed without isolation of intermediates. Generally the (2-fluoroethyl) derivatives 3 have higher σ(1) affinity and σ(1)/σ(2) selectivity than the corresponding (3-fluoropropyl) derivatives 2. The most promising candidate for the development as radiotracer is the (2-fluoroethyl) derivative 3a (WMS-1828, fluspidine, 1'-benzyl-3-(2-fluoroethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]), which shows subnanomolar σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.59nM) and excellent selectivity over the σ(2) subtype (1331-fold) as well as some other receptor systems. The novel synthetic strategy also allows the systematic pharmacological evaluation of intermediate alcohols 10.

Endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor [or opioid-receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor] are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the immune systems, and peripheral organs, and have a crucial role in the pain sensory system. Indeed, peripheral or intrathecal N/OFQ has displayed antinociceptive activities in neuropathic pain models, and inhibitory effects on pain-related neurotransmitter releases and on synaptic transmissions of C- and Aδ-fibers. In this study, design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of peripheral/spinal cord-targeting non-peptide NOP receptor agonist were investigated for the treatment of neuropathic pain, which resulted in the discovery of highly selective and potent novel NOP receptor full agonist {1-[4-(2-{hexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl}-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]cyclooctyl}methanol 1 (HPCOM) as systemically (subcutaneously) potent new-class analgesic. Thus, 1 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibitory effect against mechanical allodynia in chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain model rats, robust metabolic stability and little hERG potassium ion channel binding affinity, with its unique and potentially safe profiles and mechanisms, which were distinctive from those of N/OFQ in terms of site-differential effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1659148,20200626,16131448|49843555|53316968|53316969|53319615|53319616|53319617|53322245|53322246|53324890|53325608|53326167,103532611|124956810|124956811|124962100|124962101|124962102|124967393|124967394|124972650|124972651|124973921|124975252,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20875743,0,NULL,P41145,9606,45,,NULL

In this series, among the most potent ligands obtained, the 2-chloro-thiazoles 7a and 7b and the 2-fluorothiazole 10b showed subnanomolar mGlu(5) affinity. 10b also displayed >10000-fold selectivity over all other metabotropic receptor subtypes plus a wide range of other receptors and binding sites. The 2-fluorothiazoles 10a and 10b were labeled using [(18)F]fluoride ion (t(1/2) = 109.7 min) in moderately high radiochemical yield to provide potential radioligands that may resist troublesome radiodefluorination during the imaging of brain mGlu(5) with position emission tomography.

Binding studies revealed that all new 14-phenylpropoxymorphinans (11-18) displayed high affinity to opioid receptors. Replacement of the 14-methoxy group with a phenylpropoxy group led to an enhancement in affinity to all three opioid receptor types, with most pronounced increases in δ and κ activities, hence resulting in a loss of μ receptor selectivity. All compounds (11-18) showed potent and long-lasting antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick test in rats after subcutaneous administration. For the N-methyl derivatives 13 and 14, analgesic potencies were in the range of their 14-methoxy analogues 9 and 10, respectively. Even derivatives 15-18 with an N-cyclopropylmethyl substituent acted as potent antinociceptive agents, being several fold more potent than morphine.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1763213,20200629,5311340|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|131271836|131271837|131271839|131271840|131271841|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277788|131277789|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281858|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131287148,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,NULL,P41145,9606,45,,NULL

Reductive amination of the bicyclic ketone 11 with pyrrolidine and NaBH(OAc)3 provided the pyrrolidine 12 with excellent diastereoselectivity (>99:1). The diastereomeric pyrrolidine 24 was established by a stepwise strategy, involving an unselective nucleophilic substitution of the triflate 20 with NaN3 as key step. The synthesis of 9 and 10 was completed by LiAlH4 reduction, replacement of the PMB group at N-9 with a (3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl residue and the N-7-benzyl group with the methoxycarbonyl moiety. The κ receptor affinity of the new compounds is strongly dependent on the stereochemistry and the N-7-substituent. The (1RS,2SR,6SR)-configured pyrrolidine 9 with a methoxycarbonyl moiety at N-7 represents the most potent κ ligand (Ki=65 nM) of this series. The 65fold lower κ affinity of 9 compared with its smaller homologue 7 is partly explained by 9 being a racemic mixture, and the slightly modified dihedral angle of the pharmacophoric N(pyrrolidine)-C-C-N(dichlorophenylacetyl) substructure. However, the additional methylene moiety, which enlarges the size of the bridge, is assumed to be responsible for the reduced κ affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1785787,20200629,3505|10971999,103753541|242084400,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21481987,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Particularly, the mu opioid receptor selectivity over kappa opioid receptor of NGP was considerably enhanced compared to that of NAP.

642500,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to kappa opioid receptor,"Title: Synthesis, radiofluorination and pharmacological evaluation of a fluoromethyl spirocyclic PET tracer for central σ1 receptors and comparison with fluoroalkyl homologs._||_Abstract: The spirocyclic σ(1) receptor ligand 1 (1'-benzyl-3-(fluoromethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was prepared in four steps starting from methoxy derivative 5. Due to its high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.74nM) and selectivity against several other relevant targets, 1 was investigated as (18)F-labeled PET tracer and its biological properties were compared with those of homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 2-4. The fluoromethyl derivative 1 was faster metabolized in vitro than homologs 2-4. In contrast to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]2-4, the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 15 using the K[(18)F]F-K(222)-carbonate complex required heating to 150°C in DMSO to achieve high labeling efficiencies. Whereas radiometabolites of [(18)F]2-4 were not detected in vivo in the brain of mice, two radiometabolites of [(18)F]1 were found. Analysis of ex vivo autoradiography images provided rather low target-to-nontarget ratio for [(18)F]1 compared with [(18)F]2-4. [(18)F]1 showed a fast uptake in the brain, which decreased continuously over time. The brain-to-plasma ratio of the radiotracer [(18)F]1 was only exceeded by the fluoroethyl tracer [(18)F]2.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1941654,20200626,44474938|50994498|56840667|57402462,103697992|124958368|136930451|136943461,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22136765,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity. The modest change in spatial position of the hydroxyl moiety, and not the N-substituent, induced the change from potent agonist to an antagonist of moderate potency.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1955137,20200626,105104|5288826|57391716|57393448|57395174|57396943|57396944|57402172,103169185|103177815|136923502|136926723|136929908|136933179|136933180|136942933,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22341895,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Specific examples include diseases of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, neurologic, and musculoskeletal systems. The most significant pathway for cellular response to hypoxia is the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIFs are transcription factors responsible for the activation of genes which encode proteins that mediate adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. A high-throughput cell-based HIF-mediated gene reporter screen was carried out using the NIH's Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository to identify activators of the HIF pathway.

In the present article, the adopted rationale is the possible modulation of the receptor affinity of the cAmp containing EM-2 analogues by assigning a different stereochemistry to the Phe(3) and Phe(4) residues present in the ring. Thus, eight more analogues with different absolute configuration at the chiral center of the aromatic residues in positions 3 and 4 have been synthesized and their opioid activity examined. The stereochemical change at the α-carbon atoms leads to a meaningful enhancement of the affinity and activity toward μ opioid receptors with respect to the prototype compound 9: e.g., 9a, K(i)(μ) = 63 nM, GPI (IC(50)) = 480 nM; 9b, K(i)(μ) = 38 nM, GPI (IC(50)) = 330 nM.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2176094,20200625,5311081|71449909|71451723|71451725|71455267|71455269|71457058|71460725|71462450,103347472|163314235|163317682|163317683|163324519|163324520|163327971|163334981|163338389,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22966938,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Herein we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around a series of mGlu(2) receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). The effects of N-substitution (R(1)) and substitutions on the aryl ring (R(2)) were identified as key areas for SAR exploration (Figure 3). Investigation of the effects of varying substituents in both the isoindolinone (2) and benzisothiazolone (3) series led to compounds with improved in vitro potency and/or efficacy. In addition, several analogues exhibited promising pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.

In the course of this study, we focused on the effect of the substituent at 17-N in nalfurafine on the binding affinity for the κ receptor. The exchange of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups, which are strong electron withdrawing substituents, almost completely diminished the binding affinities for the μ and δ opioid receptors, but the binding affinity for the κ receptor was still maintained. As a result, nalfurafine derivatives with 17-fluoro-substituted alkyl groups showed higher selectivities for the κ receptor than did nalfurafine itself. With regard to the κ agonistic activities, the conversion of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups led to the gradual decrease of the agonistic activities in the order corresponding to their binding affinities for the κ receptor. In contrast, the derivative with the bulky 17-isobutyl group showed lower affinity and agonistic activity for the κ receptor than the derivatives with the smaller functional groups. This research suggested that both the electronic property and the steric characteristics of the 17-N substituent would have a great influence on the binding property for the κ receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2318807,20200625,105104|6918287|71716140|71717967|71717969|71718579|71718581|71719794|71720405,103177815|103646514|164128185|164136686|164136687|164139519|164139520|164145085|164147884,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23200250,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Recent studies demonstrated that compounds containing a biaryl-linked motif (Ar-X-Ar') modulate Na(+) currents. We, and others, have reported that compounds with an embedded benzyloxyphenyl unit (ArOCH2Ar', OCH2=X) exhibit potent anticonvulsant activities. Here, we show that benzyloxybenzylammonium chlorides ((+)H3NCH2C6H4OCH2Ar' Cl(-)) displayed notable activities in animal seizure models. Electrophysiological studies of 4-(2'-trifluoromethoxybenzyloxy)benzylammonium chloride (9) using embryonic cortical neurons demonstrated that 9 promoted both fast and slow inactivation of Na(+) channels.

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor. Thus, the analog with a 17-(3-ethoxypropyl) group showed the best selectively and potent agonistic activity for the δ receptor among KNT-127 derivatives.

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates.

Compound optimization led to the identification of potent mGlu2/3 selective PAMs with no in vitro activity at mGlu1,4-8 or 45 other CNS receptors. In vitro pharmacological characterization of representative compound 44 indicated agonist-PAM activity toward mGlu2 and PAM activity at mGlu3. The most potent mGlu2/3 PAMs were characterized in assays predictive of ADME/T and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, allowing the discovery of systemically active mGlu2/3 PAMs. On the basis of its overall profile, compound 74 was selected for behavioral studies and was shown to dose-dependently decrease cocaine self-administration in rats after intraperitoneal administration.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425012,20181006,219077|5311424|53472113|71533722|71549767|71549769|90417914,103169903|103399782|312391005|312391006|312391011|312391013|312391014,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Two series of glycopeptides were assessed for opioid receptor binding affinity. Attempts to alter the mu-selectivity of [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO)-related glycopeptides by altering the charged residues of the amphipathic helical address were unsuccessful. A series of pan-agonists was evaluated for antinociceptive activity (55 °C tail flick) in mice. A flexible linker was required to maintain antinociceptive activity. Circular dichroism (CD) in H2O, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and SDS micelles confirmed the importance of the amphipathic helices (11s → 11sG → 11) for antinociception. The glycosylated analogues showed only nascent helices and random coil conformations in H2O. Chemical shift indices (CSI) and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) with 600 MHz NMR and CD confirmed helical structures in micelles, which were rationalized by molecular dynamics calculations. Antinociceptive studies with mice confirm that these glycosylated endorphin analogues are potential drug candidates that penetrate the BBB to produce potent central effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3599492,20200624,122183214|122183215|122183216,318379856|318379857|318379858,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26125201,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

The design of non-peptide analogues is explored with 5-amino substituted (tetrahydronaphthalen-2yl) methyl containing 4-anilidopiperidine derivatives, while non-peptide-peptide ligands are explored by conjugating the C-terminus of enkephalin analogues (H-Xxx-DAla-Gly-Phe-OH) to the amino group of 4-anilidopiperidine small molecule derivatives with and without a linker. These novel bivalent ligands are evaluated for biological activities at μ and δ opioid receptors. They exhibit very good affinities at μ and δ opioid receptors, and potent agonist activities in MVD and GPI assays. Among these the lead bivalent ligand 17 showed excellent binding affinities (0.1 nM and 0.5 nM) at μ and δ opioid receptors respectively, and was found to have very potent agonist activities in MVD (56 ± 5.9 nM) and GPI (4.6 ± 1.9 nM) assays. In vivo the lead bivalent ligand 17 exhibited a short duration of action (<15 min) comparable to 4-anilidopiperidine derivatives, and moderate analgesic activity.

1272386,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to kappa type opioid receptor (unknown origin) by competition binding assay,"Title: Receptor binding profiles and quantitative structure-affinity relationships of some 5-substituted-N,N-diallyltryptamines._||_Abstract: N,N-Diallyltryptamine (DALT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) are two tryptamines synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin. In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values. At the σ2 receptor, higher affinity was correlated with increasing π. These correlations should aid in the development of more potent and selective drugs within this family of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756494,20200623,24839550|50878551|127026052|127036186|127036932|127036953,174496429|336866908|336883200|336884944|336884983|336885079,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26739781,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

The current perspective focuses on outlining and analyzing various approaches that have been used to interconvert GPCR agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists in order to achieve the intended functional activity at a GPCR of therapeutic interest.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

By revisiting this concept, and based on the structure of tramadol, we designed a series of novel compounds that act as highly potent and selective agonists of DOR among which (-)-6j showed the highest affinity (K i = 2.7 nM), best agonistic activity (EC50 = 2.6 nM), and DOR selectivity (more than 1000-fold over the other two subtype opioid receptors). Molecular docking studies suggest that the 'message' part of (-)-6j interacts with residue Asp128(3.32) and a neighboring water molecule, and the 'address' part of (-)-6j packs with hydrophobic residues Leu300(7.35), Val281(6.55), and Trp284(6.58), rendering DOR selectivity.

Pharmacological intervention has focused on molecules that decrease NRF2-ubiquitination through covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues, but such electrophilic compounds lack selectivity and may be associated with off-target toxicity. We report here the first use of a fragment-based approach to directly target the KEAP1 Kelch-NRF2 interaction. X-ray crystallographic screening identified three distinct 'hot-spots' for fragment binding within the NRF2 binding pocket of KEAP1, allowing progression of a weak fragment hit to molecules with nanomolar affinity for KEAP1 while maintaining drug-like properties. This work resulted in a promising lead compound which exhibits tight and selective binding to KEAP1, and activates the NRF2 antioxidant response in cellular and in vivo models, thereby providing a high quality chemical probe to explore the therapeutic potential of disrupting the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3819841,20180906,118170767,336901365,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27031670,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Indeed, dextro enantiomers bind with high affinity σ1 receptor while opposite enantiomers bind opioid receptors. In spite of their stereochemistry, cis-N-2-phenylethyl N-normetazocine (phenazocine) enantiomers showed mixed opioid/σ1 receptor profiles and a significant in vivo analgesia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available regarding the evaluation of σ1 pharmacological profile in the antinociceptive effects of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine. Therefore, the present study was designed to ascertain this component by in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, we tested the σ1 affinity of both enantiomers by a predictive binding assay in absence or presence of phenytoin (DPH). Our results showed that DPH (1 mM) did not increase the σ1 receptor affinity of (+)-and (-)-phenazocine (Ki = 3.8 ± 0.4 nM, Ki = 85 ± 2.0 nM, respectively) suggesting a σ1 antagonist profile of both enantiomers. This σ1 antagonistic component of two phenazocine enantiomers was corroborated by in vivo studies in which the selective σ1 receptor agonist PRE-084, was able to unmask their σ1 antagonistic component associated with the opioid activity. The σ1 antagonistic component of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine may justify their analgesic activity and it suggests that they may constitute useful lead compounds to develop new ligands with this dual activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4000648,20200620,11314197,136933674,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27721146,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041162,20200621,72771081,242581035,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Microsomal stability studies demonstrated that 14 was more metabolically resistant than salvinorin A. Evaluation of analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties revealed similar in vivo effects between 14 and salvinorin A.

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

In a second campaign, κ-opioid receptor ligands were sought with selectivity versus the μ-opioid receptor. While hit rates ranged from 40% to 63% against the on-targets, they were just as good against the antitargets, even though the molecules were selected for their putative lack of binding to the off-targets. Affinities, too, were often as good or better for the off-targets. Even though it was occasionally possible to find selective molecules, such as a mid-nanomolar D2/5-HT2A ligand with 21-fold selectivity versus the H1 receptor, this was the exception. Whereas false-negatives are tolerable in docking screens against on-targets, they are intolerable against antitargets; addressing this problem may demand new strategies in the field.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4137920,20200623,47023707|50964436|52210045|53498895|72151344|72153748|93967682|94156776|95177310|95261164|95265878|145974323,404654424|404654693|404655881|404656256|404657712|404658122|404663072|404663886|404664861|404666488|404666975|404688374,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29990431,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Elevated plasma levels of the protein have been linked to diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recently, adipocyte-specific overexpression of RBP4 was reported to cause hepatic steatosis in mice. We previously identified an orally bioavailable RBP4 antagonist that significantly lowered RBP4 serum levels in Abca4<sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice with concomitant normalization of complement system protein expression and reduction of bisretinoid formation within the retinal pigment epithelium. We describe herein the discovery of novel RBP4 antagonists 48 and 59, which reduce serum RBP4 levels by >80% in mice upon acute oral dosing. Furthermore, 59 demonstrated efficacy in the transgenic adi-hRBP4 murine model of hepatic steatosis, suggesting that RBP4 antagonists may also have therapeutic utility for the treatment of NAFLD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4305300,20210302,118872292,440138775,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31079449,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite. Herein we describe the discovery of second-generation HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 with increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile achieved by reduction of phase 2 metabolism. Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, the clinical pharmacokinetics for PT2977 supports the hypothesis that attenuating the rate of glucuronidation would improve exposure and reduce variability in patients. Early evidence of clinical activity shows promise for PT2977 in the treatment of ccRCC.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4312703,20210302,117947097,440223752,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31282155,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Thus, hLH-R represents a valid target for the treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers and diseases (polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, endometriosis) as well as contraception. Screening of the Bayer compound library led to the discovery of tetrahydrothienopyridine derivatives as novel, small-molecule (SMOL) hLH-R inhibitors and to the development of BAY-298, the first nanomolar hLH-R antagonist reducing sex hormone levels in vivo. Further optimization of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters led to the identification of BAY-899 with an improved in vitro profile and proven efficacy in vivo.

Contrary to the classical monomeric model, indirect evidence suggests that ORs might form dimers, which could be endowed with a distinct pharmacological profile, and, thus, be targeted to develop innovative pharmacological therapies. However, direct evidence for the spontaneous formation of OR dimers in living cells under physiological conditions is missing. Despite a growing interest in the κ opioid receptor (KOR), KOR-selective fluorescent probes are particularly scarce in the literature.

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis. In this Perspective, applications of fluorine in the construction of bioisosteric elements designed to enhance the in vitro and in vivo properties of a molecule are summarized.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4371120,20210302,461776|155546429,103166802|440171724,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29400967,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Herein, we expanded the SAR of that campaign and determined that the incorporation of amines into the benzylic pendant produces enhanced MOR-efficacy in this series, whereas the reincorporation of an aromatic ring into the pendant enhanced MOR-potency. Two compounds, which contain a piperidine (14) or an isoindoline (17) pendant, retained the desired opioid profile in vitro, possessed metabolic half-lives of greater than 1 h in mouse liver microsomes (MLMs), and were active antinociceptive agents in the acetic acid stretch assay (AASA) at subcutaneous doses of 1 mg/kg.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4381841,20210302,5288826|155512747|155514661|155516535|155516545|155516811|155539726|155554575|155559678|155566581|155569410,103169185|440113104|440116017|440118846|440118860|440119233|440155460|440192250|440204966|440222447|440229592,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31986033,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

These ligands have been shown to be active in vivo, do not manifest withdrawal syndromes or reward behavior in conditioned-place preference assays in mice, and do not produce dependence. Although these attributes are promising, these analogues exhibit poor metabolic stability in mouse liver microsomes, likely due to the central tetrahydroquinoline scaffold in this series. As such, a structure-activity relationship (SAR) campaign was pursued to improve their metabolic stability. This resulted in a shift from our original bicyclic tetrahydroquinoline core to a monocyclic benzylic-core system. By eliminating one of the rings in this scaffold and exploring the SAR of this new core, two promising analogues were discovered.

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase catalytic activity of the tankyrases (TNKS/TNKS2) has been reported to reduce the Wnt/β-catenin signal by preventing poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent degradation of AXIN, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. With the goal of investigating the effects of tankyrase and Wnt pathway inhibition on tumor growth, we set out to find small-molecule inhibitors of TNKS/TNKS2 with suitable drug-like properties. Starting from 1a, a high-throughput screening hit, the spiroindoline derivative 40c (RK-287107) was discovered as a potent TNKS/TNKS2 inhibitor with >7000-fold selectivity against the PARP1 enzyme, which inhibits WNT-responsive TCF reporter activity and proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell line COLO-320DM. RK-287107 also demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a mouse xenograft model.

GPCR ligands that differentially activate the downstream signaling pathways are termed functionally selective or biased ligands. A class of novel non-catechol G protein-biased agonists of the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) was recently disclosed. We conducted the first comprehensive structure-functional selectivity relationship study measuring G<sub>S</sub> and β-arrestin2 recruitment activities focused on four regions of this scaffold, resulting in over 50 analogs with diverse functional selectivity profiles. Some compounds became potent full agonists of β-arrestin2 recruitment, while others displayed enhanced G<sub>S</sub> bias compared to the starting compound.

The H3R is considered as a drug target for the treatment of several central nervous system disorders. We have synthesized and identified a novel series of 4-aryl-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolinamines that act as selective H3R antagonists. Among all the synthesized compounds, in vitro and docking studies suggested that the 4-methoxy-phenyl-substituted tetrahydroquinazolinamine compound 4c has potent and selective H3R antagonist activity (IC<sub>50</sub> < 0.04 μM). Compound 4c did not exhibit any activity on the hERG ion channel and pan-assay interference compounds liability. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that 4c crosses the blood brain barrier, and in vivo studies demonstrated that 4c induces anorexia and weight loss in obese, but not in lean mice.

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429170,20210302,130431318,440152147,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430772,20210302,155532072,440142712,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,NULL,P41145,9606,45,,NULL

However, selective MOR agonists including fentanyl and morphine derivatives are limited clinically due to high risks of dependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression. We recently reported the development of a long-acting, bifunctional MOR agonist/δ-opioid receptor (DOR) antagonist analgesic devoid of tolerance or dependence in mice (AAH8, henceforth referred to as 2B). To address the need for short-acting treatments for breakthrough pain, we present a series of novel, short-acting, high-potency MOR agonist/DOR antagonist ligands with antinociceptive activity in vivo. In this study, we utilized a two-dimensional structure-activity relationship matrix to identify pharmacological trends attributable to combinations of two key pharmacophore elements within the chemotype. This work enhances our ability to modulate efficacy at MOR and DOR, accessing a variety of bifunctional profiles while maintaining high affinity and potency at both receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4433505,20210302,155517081|155518099|155518842|155522440|155522548|155523518|155527040|155527202|155529956|155532588|155533432|155535193|155536454|155538528|155540132|155542412|155543456|155545136|155545411|155551873|155555052|155555693|155560805|155567468|155569440,440119639|440121176|440122316|440127990|440128168|440129676|440135054|440135293|440139530|440143512|440144768|440147440|440149412|440152551|440156292|440161621|440164205|440168492|440169171|440185268|440193416|440195122|440207784|440224757|440229686,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30916966,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

The peptide hormone ghrelin exerts pleiotropic effects including the stimulation of growth hormone secretion and subsequent increase of insulin-like growth factor-1 levels, an important mediator of muscle growth and repair. Ghrelin also acts on inflammation, appetite, and adipogenesis and therefore has been considered a promising therapeutic target for catabolic conditions. We previously reported on the synthesis and properties of an indane based series of ghrelin receptor full agonists which led to a sustained increase of insulin-like growth factor-1 in a dog pharmacodynamic study.

Selected structural modifications are made to the basic moiety and at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-positions on the piperidine nucleus to enable structure-activity relationships to be delineated. As a result, some highly potent and selective kappa-receptor agonists have been identified. In particular, this has been achieved by introduction of oxygen-containing functionality into the 4-position of the piperidine nucleus or the 3-position of the pyrrolidinylmethyl side chain. Thus, 1-[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]- 2-[[1-(3-oxopyrrolidinyl)]methyl]piperidine (10) possesses high activity in the rabbit vas deferens (LVD, kappa-specific tissue) (IC50 = 0.20 nM) and is a potent antinociceptive agent, as determined by the mouse acetylcholine-induced abdominal constriction test (MAC) (ED50 = 0.06 mg/kg, sc).

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750342,20181017,5359966,103230838,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Isopavines as a new class of morphinomimetics and their human opioid receptor binding activity._||_Abstract: The importance of visual imagery and relational thinking manifests itself in a heuristic approach to the design and synthesis of potential morphinomimetics as agonists of the human mu receptor. The well-known class of alkaloids represented by the isopavine nucleus has a topological resemblance to the morphine skeleton, especially when viewed in a particular way. Enantiopure isopavines can be readily obtained from a 1,2 Stevens rearrangement of 13-substituted dihydromethanodibenzoazocines, prepared in four steps from d- and l-amino acids. Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor. X-ray crystal structures of several compounds corroborate stereochemistries and overall topologies.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751994,20181017,5284371|5288826|5359272|10366960|11139094|11184946|51004758|51009928|71449105|71450900|71458037|122197314|122197315|122197316|122197485|122197486|122197487|122197488|122197489|122197490|122197491|122197492|122197493|122197494|122197495|122197496|122197497|122197498|122197499|122197500|122197501|122197502|122197503|122197504|122197505|122197506|122197507|122197508|122197509|122197510|122197511|122197512,103169185|103169342|123085530|163312605|163315964|163315965|163319422|163329699|163329700|318463930|318463933|318463938|318463939|318464366|318464367|318464368|318464369|318464370|318464371|318464372|318464373|318464374|318464375|318464376|318464377|318464378|318464379|318464380|318464381|318464382|318464383|318464384|318464385|318464386|318464387|318464388|318464389|318464390|318464391|318464392|318464393|318464394,4986,In vitro,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12502358,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,45,,NULL

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives.

In functional assays the 14-phenylacetylamino derivative 6d was a selective delta-agonist whereas the phenethylamino analogue 5d was a mu-agonist and low efficacy delta partial agonist that warrants further investigation as an analgesic with low tolerance and dependence.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755684,20181017,105104|5360515|5462471|5480230|5491897|5497186|10323346|10435156|44299404|71450932|71452746|71456256|71456257|71456258|71458065|71461667|71461668,103177815|103217856|103243877|103553488|103697951|103698780|131283791|163316036|163319497|163326369|163326370|163326371|163326372|163329761|163336743|163336744|163336745,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12672258,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons. Since the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay uses the same membrane preparations as the binding assay, differential kappa subtypes can be ruled out as an explanation in this case, and the observed behavior rather seems to reflect an intrinsic property of the ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873919,20181016,56657871,134434230,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10893307,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

The key step in the synthesis of the target compound involves the ring opening of Cbz-d-serine beta-lactone with Boc-Phe-NHCH2CH2NHCH3. Further synthetic elaboration of the resulting building block yielded compound 1 (MABE, Tyr-c[(NbetaCH3)-D-A2pr-Gly-Phe-NHCH2CH2-], where A2pr is a 2,3-diaminopropionic acid residue). Utilizing a combination of NMR and molecular modeling, the structure-biological activity relationships for compound 1 were studied. Using an in vitro isolated receptor assay, MABE was found to have affinities for isolated mu delta, and kappa opioid receptors of 1.6, 2.1, and 340 nM, respectively. By an in vivo thermal escape assay, MABE was found to have an ED50 of 0.027 microg in the rat when administered intrathecally. This effect was reversed by naloxone.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244. The cis fused, 4,5 dimethyl ether substituted cyclohexane analogue trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzo[b]thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (32) has high in vitro kappa opioid receptor affinity (Ki = 16 nM) and equipotent analgesic activity to morphine after iv administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753145,20181012,13911081|13911085|45260009|45260011|45260017|45260026|45260036|45263803|45264200|45264340|45264344|45264364|45264368|45264405|70682920|70695535,103221766|103670691|103670693|103670701|103670723|103670738|103670767|103676268|103676905|103677136|103677142|103677166|103677173|103677221|160670773|160703023,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2567782,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

However in this series of 14beta-cinnamoylamino derivatives the codeinones (e.g. methoclocinnamox, MC-CAM) had unexpectedly high mu-opioid receptor affinity, similar to that of the morphinone (clocinnamox, C-CAM). The current report relates to the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of deoxyclocinnamox (DOC-CAM) which acted as a high-affinity opioid antagonist similar to C-CAM but with greater mu selectivity. Thus it appears that the C(3)-substituent does not play a major role in the binding of the 14beta-cinnamoyl series and that the cinnamoyl group itself may in fact be the dominant binding feature.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750071,20181016,6540640|44417373,103500772|103500889,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10966754,0,NULL,P41145,9527,NULL,,NULL

Increasingly bulky enantiomeric N-alkyl homologs were prepared until their interaction with the sigma 1 receptor decreased and their insolubility became a hindrance to their evaluation in vivo and/or in vitro. The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors. However, bulkier homologs (hexyl through decyl) displayed higher enantioselectivity at kappa or delta receptors than at the mu (monkey) receptor.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL747228,20181017,10408752|10527816|10574908|10599027|10718445|10883143|10926896|10938869|11036499|11090735|11784022|11795327|11811844|15548354|15548355|71456174,103357517|103357547|103357602|103357703|103357704|103357773|103357801|103357903|103357904|103358210|103358275|103358320|103358363|163322761|163326190|163326191,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The affinities of the target compounds for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were determined by radiolabeled binding experiments using bovine brain membranes. An analogous series of 7,8-dihydrocodeinones and morphinones was prepared and assayed in the same systems. The 3-methoxy derivatives 3 and 4 were more selective than the corresponding morphinones for the mu receptor. The 5 beta-methylcodeinones 25 and 27 had lower affinity at all receptors than the corresponding morphinones, but the 5 beta-methylmorphinones had affinities similar to the morphinones 5 and 6. A similar pattern was observed in the 7,8-dihydro series. Two compounds, 5 beta-methyl-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydromorphinone, 20 (MET-CAMO), and N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydronormorphinone, 22 (N-CPM-MET- CAMO), acted as nonequilibrium ligands in antinociception and membrane binding studies. In mice after icv administration, neither ligand showed any agonist activity but 8-24 h after administration both compounds acted as potent mu antagonists. A Scatchard plot of the effect of N-CPM-MET-CAMO on [3H]DAMGO ([3H]D-Ala2, (Me)-Phe4, Gly(ol)5] enkephalin) binding to bovine striatal membranes showed that there was a significant decrease in the Bmax value and a marginal effect on the Kd value suggesting that the number of binding sites was reduced. When taken together, these results support the view that 20 and 22 bind covalently to the mu receptor. On the other hand, when N-acetylcysteine and 22 were allowed to react in a buffered solution, 22 was recovered unchanged. Under these conditions no Michael reaction was observed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752147,20181013,11849246|11849365|44336988|44337160|44337164|44337243|44337264|44337269|44337271|44337273|44337274|44337275|44337276|44337314|44337316|44337344|46878245,103327006|103327386|103327396|103327546|103327576|103327594|103327603|103327611|103327612|103327613|103327614|103327722|103327724|103327783|103734817|103734823|103735536,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7693944,0,NULL,P41145,9913,NULL,,NULL

Chromatography of the mixture resulted in conversion of the bulk of the thiol 9 to the disulfide 13 by air oxidation. The disulfide 13 was also prepared by condensing the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether of 4 with the dithiodiglycolyl chloride and treating the resulting product with F- to give the desired product. The pure thiol 9 free of contamination with the disulfide was prepared by treating 13 with excess N-acetyl-L-cysteine and processing the reaction mixture without resorting to chromatography for purification. The corresponding N-(cyclopropylmethyl) nor compound 15 was prepared from the silyl ether 6 and acetylthioglycolyl chloride followed by hydrolysis, treatment with F-, and air oxidation. Incubation of bovine striatal membranes with 13 and 15 resulted in wash-resistant inhibition of the binding of the mu-selective peptide [3H][D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,Gly(ol)5]-enkephalin (DAMGO).

148431,Confirmatory,Compound was evaluated for the agonistic activity against Opioid receptor kappa 1 in rabbit vas deferens.,"Title: Synthesis and biological activities of dynorphin A analogues with opioid antagonist properties._||_Abstract: Dynorphin A, which displays a wide variety of physiological effects, binds to opioid receptors preferentially at the kappa receptor type. kappa-selective antagonists would be very useful as pharmacological and biochemical probes to study and better understand the action of dynorphin A at its preferred receptor. However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754273,20181010,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,NULL,P41145,9986,NULL,,NULL

Their biological activities were determined in the three bioassays [guinea pig ileum (GPI), mouse vas deferens (MVD), and rabbit vas deferens (RVD)] and in the mouse tail-pinch test after intravenous administration. Some analogues that showed interesting activity in the bioassays and/or in the analgesic tests were further characterized in mu-, delta-, and kappa-representative binding assays. The obtained data indicate that modification of the enkephalin segment to give metabolically stable analogues with high affinity and selectivity for the kappa receptor is strictly limited and that introduction of MeArg in position 7 protects the Arg6-Arg-7 bond from enzymatic degradation without potency drop and change of opioid receptor selectivity. [MeTyr1,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (18) [IC50 (nM) = 0.3 (GPI), 7.4 (MVD), and 2.6 (RVD); tail pinch ED50 (mg/kg) = 0.75] showed opioid activity similar to that of dynorphin A in the three bioassays and relatively high kappa-receptor selectivity in the binding assays and produced a 2.5-fold more potent analgesic effect than morphine. [D-Cys2-Cys5,MeArg7,D-Leu8]Dyn(1-8)-NHEt (20) showed a 40-60-fold more potent opioid activity than 18 in the three bioassays and produced a 3.4-fold more potent analgesic effect than 18.

These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand.

It was found that (-)-3 is substantially more potent than its enantiomer (+)-3 as an opioid agonist in vivo and in vitro. In vitro tests (guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle and mouse vas deferens preparations) suggest that (-)-3 mediates its effect chiefly through mu opioid receptors. On the other hand, (+)-3 and the more potent enantiomers of methadone, (-)-1, and isomethadone, (-)-2, appear to have less mu-receptor selectivity and interact with a greater fraction of delta receptors than does (-)-3. The fact that the solid-state conformation of (-)-3 differs from that of (-)-1 and (-)-2, which show great similarity in conformational features, suggests that mu and delta receptors have different conformational requirements.

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752205,20181016,132913|134131,103310030|103310529,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists. One of them, 13a, has shown in vivo at very low dose a potent anxiolytic-like activity in the light/dark test.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750578,20181015,9863146,103237550,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8642566,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL
148747,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards opioid receptor kappa 2,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 1234-1237), the most potent antinociceptive compounds preferred a particular orientation of the phenyl ring.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750588,20181013,5288826|12368881|44284742|44285029|44285070|44299404,103169185|103213590|103213625|103214145|103214210|103243877,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1315868,0,NULL,P41145,9913,NULL,,NULL

These enantiomers, (-)- and (+)-4.HCl, were prepared by esterification of the corresponding alcohols, (+)- and (-)-4a. Single crystal X-ray studies of (-)-4a.HCl reveal that it possesses the 2R,4S absolute configuration. Analgetic testing in mice (hot-plate) and receptor binding studies indicate that (-)-(2S,4R)-4.HCl is approximately ten times more potent than its enantiomer. The results are consistent with the operation of the Ogston effect in the interaction of achiral 4-phenylpiperidines with opioid receptors.

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding. However, a relationship involving the hydrophobic character of the N-substituent is discussed.

These agents were prepared to obtain electrophilic opioid ligands potentially useful in the characterization of opioid receptors and drug-receptor interactions. Preparation of these ligands was accomplished from 3-O-trityl-6 beta-naltrexol (13) via phase transfer-catalyzed alkylation of the regioisomeric o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzyl halides and the o-, m-, and p-cyanobenzyl halides.

The ligands (6-11) were tested in radioligand displacement assays in guinea pig brain homogenate for opioid receptor binding affinity and irreversibility. All six of the isothiocyanates demonstrated significant affinity in the displacement assays for all three opioid receptors. They also appeared to be irreversibly bound at each of the receptor types.

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849963,20200704,5360515|44297100,103238133|131283791,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL
228143,Literature-derived,"Binding affinity towards human kappa,mu,delta receptors was calculated as the ratio; 1/0.34/3.5","Title: Structure-activity relationships of dynorphin a analogues modified in the address sequence._||_Abstract: The peptide [Pro3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 2 exhibits high affinity (K(i) = 2.4 nM) and over 2000-fold selectivity for the opioid receptor. Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM).

Evidence for the existence of different mu receptor subtypes in different tissues._||_Abstract: A series of beta-funaltrexamine (2, beta-FNA) analogues (3-14) were synthesized that contain a variety of electrophilic groups attached at the 6 beta-position of the opiate. The opioid agonist and antagonist activities of these ligands were evaluated in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) in vitro assays. Several of the compounds behaved like beta-FNA in that they exhibited reversible agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors and irreversible antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. The rank order of irreversible antagonism for a series of related Michael acceptors did not parallel their intrinsic chemical reactivity, confirming that the degree of covalent binding is in part dependent on the spatial disposition of the electrophilic center relative to the receptor nucleophile (secondary recognition). The maleimidoacetamide 8 behaved very differently from beta-FNA in that it exhibited considerably greater irreversible mu antagonism in MVD relative to the mu blockage in the GPI. This suggests that different proportions of mu receptor subtypes exist in the two tissues. Several of the agents tested, including some nonreactive control compounds, displayed an unusual type of persistent kappa agonist activity in the GPI. This activity, which was reversed by addition of naloxone, reappeared upon washing. Receptor models have been presented to explain this effect. A few of the reactive ligands displayed a true nonreversible kappa agonist activity, suggesting a covalent association with the receptor.

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

The methyloctahydroisoquinolines 6a-g can exist in conformations where the 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent is either axial or equatorial, similar to the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines 4.

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process.

One of our research goals was to explore the bioactive conformation of the N-phenethyl trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine derivative 3, prototypical mu-opioid antagonist in this series. In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro.

Three of the 10 compounds, (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-9-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl-2-phenylethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10), (1R,5S)-(+)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methylene-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S)-(+)-14), and (1R,5S,9R)-(-)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methyl-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S,9R)-(+)-15) had subnanomolar affinity at mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.19, 0.19, and 0.63 nM, respectively). The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point. Based on modeling, the spatial arrangement of the protonated nitrogen atom and the 9beta-OH substituent in (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 may facilitate the alignment of a putative water chain enabling proton transfer to a nearby proton acceptor group in the mu-opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL895010,20181022,16756840|16757050|44427434,103525470|103525473|103525475,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17625813,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain. These data demonstrate that acute and selective pharmacological blockade of Na(v)1.8 sodium channels in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL935651,20181023,16038374,103558202,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17483457,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1016592,20181024,3037926,103241212,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Compound 6 (NAP) showed over 700-fold selectivity for the MOR over the delta receptor (DOR) and more than 150-fold selectivity over the kappa receptor (KOR). Compound 9 (NAQ) showed over 200-fold selectivity for the MOR over the DOR and approximately 50-fold selectivity over the KOR. Thus these two novel ligands will serve as leads to further develop more potent and selective antagonists for the MOR.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1006332,20181026,5311018|5360515|24822798|24824637|24824638|25232367|25232539|25232540|25232541|25232542|25232543|25232724|25232725|25232727|25233078|25233081|25233083|25233258|44564372,103576778|103576944|103577099|103592021|103592778|103592779|103592780|103592834|103592835|103592836|103592905|103592906|103592976|103592977|103592978|103593073|103593074|103593075|131283791,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19199782,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,197,,NULL

The series similarity to previously reported sigma ligands prompted analysis at sigma receptors to determine the SAR for affinity at sigma receptors. Within the N-substituent series the saturated analogs showed increased affinity at both sigma receptors. Optimal chain length in the N-arylalkyl series for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors proved to be N-propylphenyl; extension to a four carbon chain dramatically decreased affinity at both receptors. Substituents in the 4-position affect only sigma(1) affinity; no change in affinity at sigma(2) was shown. The N-isobutyl, N-phenylpropyl, and N-benzyl analogs are worth pursuing due to their good affinity and selectivity at the sigma(1) receptor, whereas the N-benzyl analog exhibits the greatest selectivity for sigma(1).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL995854,20181026,62513|191408|13046858|13599612|18997149|24885962|24885965|24886211|24886213,103628005|103628006|103628007|103628060|103628061|103628062|103628063|103628064|103628065,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17988766,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL
350955,Literature-derived,Inhibition of kappa opioid receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022875,20180910,17758320,103530856,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970721,20181026,105104,103177815,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,NULL,P41145,9606,45,,NULL

Purines 2-4 were active in mouse bioassays at higher doses. The seizurogenic activity of 1 was correlated with inhibition of neuronal GABAergic transmission, with only a modest impact on excitatory signaling, in electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons. Despite having a purine template structure, the inhibitory activity of 1 was not prevented by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Thus, 1 represents a novel substituted purine that elicits convulsions through its actions on inhibitory neurotransmission.

An initial hit compound 5a of modest potency (IC(50) = 1.2 μM) was synthesized. Evaluation of structure-activity relationships (SAR) on the left-hand side of the molecule revealed a preference for a 2-substituted pyridine group linked directly to the central heterocycle. Variation of the central azolo-amine portion of the molecule revealed a preference for the [4,5-c]-oxazoloazepine scaffold, while right-hand side variants showed a preference for ortho- and meta-substituted benzene rings linked directly to the tertiary amine of the saturated heterocycle. These iterations led to the synthesis of 29b, a potent (IC(50) = 16 nM) and selective negative modulator that showed good brain penetrance, high receptor occupancy, and a duration of action greater than 1 h in rat when administered intraperitoneally. Formal PK studies in rat and Rhesus monkey revealed a short half-life that was attributable to high first-pass clearance.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1260197,20200626,46853594,123089498,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20809633,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL
548689,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to opioid receptor KOR,"Title: Synthesis and pharmacological properties of novel hydrophilic 5-HT4 receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important signalling molecule in the human body. The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640635,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,NULL,P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets. Altogether lersivirine is a highly potent and selective NNRTI, with excellent efficacy against NNRTI-resistant viruses.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1691875,20200626,16739244,103708524,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20660667,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

This demonstrates the first reported results for both cycloaddition of the furan ring and functionalization via microwave-assisted methodology of the salvinorin A skeleton.

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects.

The presence of the Pro(2) represents a crucial factor for the ligand structural and conformational properties. Proline is in fact an efficient stereochemical spacer, capable of inducing favorable spatial orientation of aromatic rings, a key factor for ligand recognition and interaction with receptors. Here the Pro(2) has been replaced by 4(S)-NH(2)-2(S)-proline (cAmp), a proline/GABA cis-chimera residue. This bivalent amino acid maintains the capacity to influenc the tetrapeptide conformation and offers the opportunity to generate new linear models and unusually constrained cyclic analogues characterized by an N-terminal Tyr bearing a free α-amino group. The results indicate that the new analogues do not show affinity for both δ and κ opioid receptors and bind only poorly to the μ receptors (for cyclopeptide 9: K(i)(μ) = 660 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 1.4% at 1 μM; for linear tetrapeptide acid 13: K(i)(μ) = 2000 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 0% at 1 μM; for linear tetrapeptide amide 15: K(i)(μ) = 310 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 894 nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2049661,20200627,57385006|70684123|70686263,160674315|160679653|160685014,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22394120,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

However, a variety of adverse effects were associated with them, partially due to their relatively low MOR selectivity. NAP, a 6β-N-4'-pyridyl substituted naltrexamine derivative, was identified previously as a potent and highly selective MOR antagonist mainly acting within the peripheral nervous system. The noticeable diarrhea associated with it prompted the design and synthesis of its analogues in order to study its structure-activity relationship. Among them, compound 8 showed improved pharmacological profiles compared to the original lead, acting mainly at peripheral while increasing the intestinal motility in morphine-pelleted mice (ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg). The slight decrease of the ED(50) compared to the original lead was well compensated by the unobserved adverse effect.

In the course of this study, we focused on the effect of the substituent at 17-N in nalfurafine on the binding affinity for the κ receptor. The exchange of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups, which are strong electron withdrawing substituents, almost completely diminished the binding affinities for the μ and δ opioid receptors, but the binding affinity for the κ receptor was still maintained. As a result, nalfurafine derivatives with 17-fluoro-substituted alkyl groups showed higher selectivities for the κ receptor than did nalfurafine itself. With regard to the κ agonistic activities, the conversion of the 17-N substituent in nalfurafine from cyclopropylmethyl to fluoro-substituted alkyl groups led to the gradual decrease of the agonistic activities in the order corresponding to their binding affinities for the κ receptor. In contrast, the derivative with the bulky 17-isobutyl group showed lower affinity and agonistic activity for the κ receptor than the derivatives with the smaller functional groups.

The structure of compound 1 comprises a hydroxycyclopentenone ring instead of the furanone ring characteristic for phthalides and represents a new carbon arrangement within polyketides. In the epimeric compounds 5a and 5b the phthalide (=isobenzofuranone) nucleus is modified to an isobenzofuran ring with ketal and acetal functionalities. Biosynthetically the structural skeletons of cyclomarinone (1) and maristachones A (2), C (4), D (5a), and E (5b) are most unusual due to the presence of an additional carbon atom when compared to the basic polyketide skeleton. This special biosynthetic feature also holds true for the likewise isolated polyketide marilactone (6).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2341824,20180926,71658646,164138116,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23268694,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, it now appears that biological diversity has evolved an alternative source. Specifically, at least two alkaloids isolated from the plant Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine ((E)-2-[(2S,3S)-3-ethyl-8-methoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b-octahydroindolo[3,2-h]quinolizin-2-yl]-3-methoxyprop-2-enoic acid methyl ester; 9-methoxy coryantheidine; MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG), and several synthetic analogues of these natural products display centrally mediated (supraspinal and spinal) antinociceptive (analgesic) activity in various pain models. Several characteristics of these compounds suggest a classic 'opioid' mechanism of action: nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors, competitive interaction with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, and two-way analgesic cross-tolerance with morphine. However, other characteristics of the compounds suggest novelty, particularly chemical structure and possible greater separation from side effects.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399075,20200629,5360515|68867300|71680922|71680923|71680924|71681076|71681077|71681078|71681079,131283791|174491695|174491696|174496752|174507179|174512307|174517359|174517360|174522568,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

The affinity of the 5-phenylmorphans for opioid receptors is increased by a C8-methyl substituent, compared with its C7 analog. The affinity of the newly synthesized compounds is generally for the μ-opioid receptor, rather than the δ- or κ-receptors. Addition of a new cyclohexane ring to the C7 and C8 positions on the cyclohexane ring of the 5-phenylmorphans enhances μ-receptor affinity, bringing the Ki to the subnanomolar level.

The N-methyl-11-aminopentacyclo[5.4.0.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9)]undecan-8-ones demonstrated the poorest σ receptor affinities, suggesting that 4-azahexacyclo[5.4.1.0(2,6).0(3,10).0(5,9).0(8,11)]dodecan-3-ols interact with σ receptors in the bridged hemiaminal form rather than as the non-transannular, aminoketone tautomers.

Compound 4 exhibited excellent anticonvulsant activity in rodents against audiogenic, electrically induced, and chemically induced seizures. Mechanistically, 4 inhibited voltage-gated Na(+) channels and N-type Ca(2+) channels and was effective as a K(+) channel opener. The anticonvulsant profile of 4 suggests that it may be useful for treating multiple forms of epilepsy (generalized tonic-clonic, complex partial, absence seizures), including refractory (or pharmacoresistant) epilepsy, at dose levels that confer a good safety margin.

While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor. Thus, the analog with a 17-(3-ethoxypropyl) group showed the best selectively and potent agonistic activity for the δ receptor among KNT-127 derivatives.

Y2 receptor is the most abundant Y subtype receptor in the central nervous system and implicated with food intake, bone formation, affective disorders, alcohol and drugs of abuse, epilepsy, pain, and cancer. The lack of small molecule non-peptidic Y2 receptor modulators suitable as in vivo pharmacological tools hampered the progress to uncover the precise pharmacological role of Y2. Only in recent years, several potent, selective and non-peptidic Y2 antagonists have been discovered providing the tools to validate Y2 receptor as a therapeutic target. This Letter reviews Y2 receptor modulators mainly non-peptidic antagonists and their structure-activity relationships.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3107077,20180929,71719108,164141790,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24365162,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

For many decades, natural product research has been a very active field of research in Mexico, and there also are some ongoing ethnopharmacological research efforts. This review provides an overview and critical appraisal on some key developments in these fields and examples of medicinal plants used by indigenous communities that have become of great local importance in Mexican popular medicine. In this review, the focus is on plants with effects on the CNS, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory processes, and gastrointestinal disorders. While some of the major food plants consumed worldwide originate from southern North America, only very few medicinal plants have become of major global importance. Opuntia species are now used increasingly to manage diabetes and metabolic syndrome and represent an example of a novel medicinal product/supplement. Undoubtedly, narcotic and mind-altering drugs both have received the widest scientific interest and have attracted considerable popular attention. The history of use of the indigenous Mexican Materia Medica in the context of research on local and popular resources specifically with regard to the diverse challenges in the context of studying the world's biodiversity and the development of comparative and semiquantitative ethnobotanical research methods is discussed herein. Natural product and ethnopharmacological research in Mexico seems to have been influenced by the political and societal developments originating from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and subsequent conventions, which have not yet had the desired effect of giving value to these local resources, as they might deserve. Their equitable and sustainable implementation remains a challenge. Natural product research and ethnopharmacology will play a key role in developing an adequate evidence base for such products derived from local and traditional knowledge in Mexico.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3131491,20180929,128563,103457931,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24559070,0,NULL,P41145,9606,45,,NULL

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285644,20200618,5748589|90678812|90678813,242640973|242640974|242640975,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Given the absence of therapeutic options available and the significance of VEEV as a weaponized agent, an optimization effort was initiated around a quinazolinone screening hit 1 with promising cellular antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.8 μM), limited cytotoxic liability (CC50 > 50 μM), and modest in vitro efficacy in reducing viral progeny (63-fold at 5 μM). Scaffold optimization revealed a novel rearrangement affording amidines, specifically compound 45, which was found to potently inhibit several VEEV strains in the low nanomolar range without cytotoxicity (EC50 = 0.02-0.04 μM, CC50 > 50 μM) while limiting in vitro viral replication (EC90 = 0.17 μM).

Penetration through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the therapeutic target is a major obstacle in development. The rapid CNS penetration of salvinorin A has suggested that the neoclerodane nucleus offers an excellent scaffold for developing antiproliferative compounds that enter the CNS. The Liebeskind-Srogl reaction was used as the main carbon-carbon bond-forming step toward the synthesis of quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues. Quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues were shown to have antiproliferative activity against the MCF7 breast cancer cell line, but show no significant activity at the κ-opioid receptors. In an in vitro model of BBB penetration, quinone-containing salvinorin A analogues were shown to passively diffuse across the cell monolayer.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425015,20181006,219077,103399782,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Hence, we synthesized zyklophin analogues to explore the structure-activity relationships of this peptide. The synthesis of selected analogues required modification to introduce the N-terminal amino acid due to poor solubility and/or to avoid epimerization of this residue. Among the N-terminal modifications, the N-phenethyl and N-cyclopropylmethyl substitutions resulted in analogues with the highest KOR affinities.

In this paper, we expand on our original series by presenting two modifications, both of which were designed with the following objectives: (1) probing bioavailability and improving metabolic stability, (2) balancing affinities between MOR and DOR while reducing affinity and efficacy at the κ-opioid receptor (KOR), and (3) improving in vivo efficacy. Here, we establish that, through N-acetylation of our original peptidomimetic series, we are able to improve DOR affinity and increase selectivity relative to KOR while maintaining the desired MOR agonist/DOR antagonist profile.

They are also employed in fluorescent binding assays. This study is centered on the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of fluorescent probes for the opioid receptors, for which relatively few non-peptidic fluorescent probes currently exist. The known μ-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist, buprenorphine, was structurally elaborated to include an amidoalkylamine linker moiety that was coupled with a range of fluorophores to afford new fluorescent probes. All compounds proved to be selective MOR antagonists. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the probe incorporating a sulfonated cyanine-5 fluorophore was the most appropriate for imaging studies. This ligand was subsequently employed in an automated fluorescence-based competition binding assay, allowing the pKi values of several well-known opioid ligands to be determined.

In fact, ligands possessing multitarget capabilities led to an improved pharmacological fingerprint.

Building upon these considerations, we synthesized a new series of LP1 analogues by introducing naphthyl or heteroaromatic rings in propanamide side chain of its N-substituent (9-15). In vitro competition-binding assays in HEK293 cells stably expressing MOR, DOR or KOR showed that in compound 9 the 1-naphthyl ring led to the retention of MOR affinity (Ki(MOR)=38±4nM) displaying good selectivity versus DOR and KOR. In the electrically stimulated GPI, compound 9 was inactive as agonist but produced an antagonist potency value (pA2) of 8.6 in presence of MOR agonist DAMGO. Moreover, subcutaneously administered it antagonized the antinociceptive effects of morphine with an AD50=2.0mg/kg in mouse-tail flick test. Modeling studies on MOR revealed that compound 9 fit very well in the binding pocket but in a different way in respect to the agonist LP1. Probably the replacement of its N-substituent on the III, IV and V TM domains reflects an antagonist behavior.

Pharmacological intervention has focused on molecules that decrease NRF2-ubiquitination through covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues, but such electrophilic compounds lack selectivity and may be associated with off-target toxicity. We report here the first use of a fragment-based approach to directly target the KEAP1 Kelch-NRF2 interaction. X-ray crystallographic screening identified three distinct 'hot-spots' for fragment binding within the NRF2 binding pocket of KEAP1, allowing progression of a weak fragment hit to molecules with nanomolar affinity for KEAP1 while maintaining drug-like properties. This work resulted in a promising lead compound which exhibits tight and selective binding to KEAP1, and activates the NRF2 antioxidant response in cellular and in vivo models, thereby providing a high quality chemical probe to explore the therapeutic potential of disrupting the KEAP1-NRF2 interaction.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3819842,20180906,118170767,336901365,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27031670,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Important features of the cyclopropane ring are, the (1) coplanarity of the three carbon atoms, (2) relatively shorter (1.51 Å) C-C bonds, (3) enhanced π-character of C-C bonds, and (4) C-H bonds are shorter and stronger than those in alkanes. The present review will focus on the contributions that a cyclopropyl ring makes to the properties of drugs containing it. Consequently, the cyclopropyl ring addresses multiple roadblocks that can occur during drug discovery such as (a) enhancing potency, (b) reducing off-target effects,",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3857936,20200624,5284594,103256810,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27299736,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

We thus designed a series of variable-length (15-41 atoms) bivalent linked peptides with selective but moderate/low-affinity pharmacophores for the mu and delta opioid receptors. We observed a U-shaped MDOR potency/affinity profile in vitro, with the 24-atom spacer length (D24M) producing the highest MDOR potency/affinity (<1 nM) and selectivity (≥89-fold). We further evaluated D24M in mice and observed that D24M dose-dependently antagonized tail flick antinociception produced by the MDOR agonists CYM51010 and Deltorphin-II, without antagonizing the monomer agonists DAMGO and DSLET. We also observed that D24M sharply reduced withdrawal behavior in models of acute and chronic morphine dependence. These findings suggest that D24M is a first-in-class high-potency MDOR-selective antagonist both in vitro and in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4145323,20200618,5480230|10664865|11498201|145958618,103505604|103698780|404659208|404665137,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29939746,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Compounds ZL0420 (28) and ZL0454 (35) were identified as potent and selective BRD4 inhibitors with nanomolar binding affinities to bromodomains (BDs) of BRD4. Both of them can be well docked into the acetyl-lysine (KAc) binding pocket of BRD4, forming key interactions including the critical hydrogen bonds with Asn140 directly and Tyr97 indirectly via a H2O molecule. Both compounds 28 and 35 exhibited submicromolar potency of inhibiting the TLR3-dependent innate immune gene program, including ISG54, ISG56, IL-8, and Groβ genes in cultured human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs).

Details of the reaction mechanism are given and the effects of the substituent at position 6 of several opioids on the reaction outcome is discussed. The opioid hydroxy ketones prepared are antagonists at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors. Docking simulations and detailed structure-activity analysis revealed that the presence of the 7β-hydroxy-8-ketone functionality in the prepared compounds can be used to gain activity towards the delta opioid receptor.

Analysis of the medicinal chemistry parameters of the 3,5-substituents of derivatives of template 5 enabled us to design a class of drug-like molecules with lower intrinsic clearance and higher oral bioavailability which led to the novel RARα agonist 4-(3-chloro-4-ethoxy-5-isopropoxybenzamido)-2-methylbenzoic acid 56 that has high RARα potency and excellent selectivity versus RARβ (2 orders of magnitude) and RARγ (4 orders of magnitude) at both the human and mouse RAR receptors with improved drug-like properties.

We have explored the structure-activity relationship of a 3-(4-phenyl-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5-(aryl)benzoic acid antagonist scaffold, assisted by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a P2Y14R homology model. A computational pipeline using the High Throughput MD Python environment guided the analogue design. Selection of candidates was based upon ligand-protein shape and complementarity and the persistence of ligand-protein interactions over time. Predictions of a favorable substitution of a 5-phenyl group with thiophene and an insertion of a three-methylene spacer between the 5-aromatic and alkyl amino moieties were largely consistent with empirical results. The substitution of a key carboxylate group on the core phenyl ring with tetrazole or truncation of the 5-aryl group reduced affinity. The most potent antagonists, using a fluorescent assay, were a primary 3-aminopropyl congener 20 (MRS4458) and phenyl p-carboxamide 30 (MRS4478).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4189972,20200618,145973771,404687565,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767967,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

These species generally grow in Asia and Africa and have been used in folk medicine for their apparent analgesic and antipyretic activities. Columbin (1) is of particular interest due to its structural similarity to the known kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) agonist salvinorin A. Given that the KOR is of interest in the study of many serious diseases, such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction, obtaining natural or semisynthetic molecules with KOR activity recently has gained much interest. For this reason, in the present study, derivatives of 1 were designed and synthesized using known structure-activity relationships of salvinorin A at KORs. The structures of the columbin analogues prepared were elucidated by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy, and their KOR activity was investigated in vitro by inhibition of forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. Slight improvements in KOR activity were observed in columbin derivatives over their parent compound. However, despite the structural similarities to salvinorin A, neither columbin (1) nor its derivatives were potent KOR ligands. This work represents not only the first evaluation of columbin (1) at the KOR but also one of the first works to explore synthetic strategies that are tolerated on the columbin core.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4192727,20200618,145965612|145965848|145966903|145972508|145977620,404675479|404675848|404677433|404685658|404693322,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28718638,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Three of the isomers synthesized showed antagonist activity for the opioid growth factor (OGF)/opioid growth factor receptor (OGFR) axis which is involved in cellular and organ growth control. This cellular signaling mechanism is targeted by 'low-dose' naltrexone therapy which is being tested clinically for multiple sclerosis, Crohn's disease, cancer, and wound healing disorders.

The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models. The compounds did not inhibit the structurally related fungal enzyme sterol Δ8,7-isomerase, but showed inhibition of diverse enzymes in late cholesterol biosynthesis at high concentrations. In a screening against more than 50 target proteins, (2S)-1-benzyl-4-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,4-diazepane ((S)-28b, Ki(σ1)=0.86nM) showed a clean receptor profile.

Microsomal stability studies demonstrated that 14 was more metabolically resistant than salvinorin A.

In a second campaign, κ-opioid receptor ligands were sought with selectivity versus the μ-opioid receptor. While hit rates ranged from 40% to 63% against the on-targets, they were just as good against the antitargets, even though the molecules were selected for their putative lack of binding to the off-targets. Affinities, too, were often as good or better for the off-targets. Even though it was occasionally possible to find selective molecules, such as a mid-nanomolar D2/5-HT2A ligand with 21-fold selectivity versus the H1 receptor, this was the exception.

Since neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor antagonists reversed opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, the present work was performed to synthetize two branched peptidomimetics, EKR and RKE, containing the opioid peptide endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9. Our data obtained from the in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate experiment demonstrated that EKR functioned as a mixed mu-, delta-opioid receptors agonist and NPFF<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist/NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist, whereas RKE acted as a multi-functional peptidomimetic with the mu-opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism. Furthermore, EKR and RKE completely blocked the NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth of Neuro 2A cells. In vivo antinociception studies found that supraspinal administration of EKR and RKE dose-dependently produced potent antinociception via the mu-opioid receptor in the tail-flick test. In carrageenan inflammatory pain model, spinal administration of EKR and RKE induced dose-related analgesia, which was significantly reduced by the opioid antagonist naloxone and the NPFF antagonist RF9. Notably, compared with morphine, intracerebroventricular repeated administration of EKR and RKE maintained prolonged antinociceptive effectiveness. In addition, at the antinociceptive doses, these two branched peptidomimetics did not significantly inhibit gastrointestinal transit. Taken together, the present work suggest that EKR and RKE behave as multi-functional ligands with the opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism, and produce prolonged antinociception with limited side effects. Moreover, our results imply that EKR and RKE might be interesting pharmacological tools for further investigating the biological function of the NPFF and opioid systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4333172,20210302,5311081|155515973|155520785,103347472|440118014|440125450,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30626554,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies. Compounds 4, 5, and 9 with agonist efficacies between 25% and 35% significantly attenuated motor deficits in the 6-OHDA-hemilesioned rat model of PD.

We have synthesized and identified a novel series of 4-aryl-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinazolinamines that act as selective H3R antagonists.

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396145,20210302,155565189,440218835,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM).

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity. Molecular modeling suggests that ML417 interacts with the D3R in a unique manner, possibly explaining its remarkable selectivity. ML417 was also found to protect against neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs. Together with promising pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles, these results suggest that ML417 is a novel and uniquely selective D3R agonist that may serve as both a research tool and a therapeutic lead for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4406678,20210302,119570|27842480|53475319,103245538|163332281|440152736,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32342685,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

The investigations of amide-type NTI derivatives revealed that N-phenylacetyl and N-dihydrocinnamoyl derivatives 3a and 3b were DOR full agonists. The same transformations were applied to a DOR agonist KNT-127 to provide the more potent DOR agonists 6a and 6b. Among the tested compounds, the most efficacious compound 6a showed dose-dependent antidepressant-like effects in the mouse forced swim test. The antidepressant-like effects by 6a seemed to be more potent than those of KNT-127, which is a more potent DOR agonist in in vitro assays. The amide-type compound like 6a may more fully penetrate into the central nervous system.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4629273,20210802,5497186|122633395|122633436|156010938|156021880,103697951|442048405|442050217|442051016|442063983,4986,NULL,P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32299730,0,NULL,P41145,9606,197,,NULL

Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds.

1786,Summary,Summary of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor,"Data Source: Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (SBCCG)_||_Source Affiliation: Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI, San Diego, CA)_||_Network: NIH Molecular Libraries Production Centers Network (MLPCN)_||_Grant Number:  1X01DA026208-01_||_Assay Provider: Dr. Lawrance Barak , Duke University, Durham NC_||_Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds._||_This AID summarizes SBCCG's probe development efforts to identify agonists of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR)._||_Two potential probes have been identified and probe reports have been submitted describing compound screening._||_From the primary HTS and subsequent hit confirmation (AID 1777) several hit compounds were identified. Hits were clustered into scaffolds and SAR studies were performed on compounds from several scaffolds reconfirming potency (AID 2284). Agonist activity was further confirmed for these compounds via image-based high content assays (AID 2133, 2359). Compounds were further tested for selectivity against the related delta (AID 2343, 2370) and mu opioid receptors (AID 2344, 2352). Two novel scaffolds were identified as KOR agonists with CID5236771 (ML139) representing the potent and selective probe for chemical series 1 and CID44601470 (ML138) representing the potent and selective probe for chemical series 2. _||_Details of protocols, compound structures, and results from the original assays can be found in PubChem at the respective AIDs listed below.",14,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A205-KOR-Agonist-Summary-Assay,20110104,5236771|44601470,87218782|87334039,4986,NULL,NP_000903,NIH Initiatives,1664548|7483322|7592342|7649270|7890732|8137953|8574585|8585130|9022829|9346876|12954747|15090153|15090178|15289816|15525797|15542743|15935455|16353938|16353947|16483675|16924269|17105950,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL
1788,Other,Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor: Agonist Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: P. Jeffrey Conn_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor_||_Grant Number: 1 R03 MH077606-01_||_The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

1924,Other,High throughput discovery of novel modulators of ROMK K+ channel activity: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Jerod Denton_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: High throughput discovery of novel modulators of ROMK K+ channel activity_||_Grant Number: R21 NS057041-01_||_The Renal Outer Medullary Potassium channel (ROMK, Kir1.1) is expressed in the renal tubule where it critically regulates fluid and electrolyte homeostasis (1).  An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

1347330,Literature-derived,OPRK1 antagonist assay in Kappa opioid ligands,"The cell line for the OPRK1 antagonist assay stably expresses the following elements. The carboxy terminus of the OPRK1 receptor has a 7 amino acid linker, followed by the TEV protease cleavage site and a GAL4-VP16 fusion protein. The cell line also expresses a b-arrestin-2-TEV protease fusion protein and contains a reporter construct consisting of the UAS response element and the b-lactamase (bla) reporter gene. Upon activation of the receptor, g-protein receptor kinase (GRK) phosphorylates specific intracellular residues of OPKR1 and this induces recruitment of B-arrestin2-TEV protease fusion protein. The TEV protease recognizes and cleaves the TEV site, releasing the GAL4-VP16 fusion protein, which then translocates to the nucleus. The GAL4-V16 binds to the UAS element, driving expressing of the b-lactamase gene. B-lactamase expression is detected with the cell permeable, fluorescent substrate, CCF4-AM. This substrate consists of coumarin tethered to fluoroscein via a b-lactam ring. In the absence of b-lactamase, excitation of the dye with 405 nm light results in FRET from the coumarin to fluoroscein and emission of green (525 nm maximum) light. B-lactamase cleavage of the substrate separates the courmarin fluorophore from the fluorscein, and 405 nm excitation results in blue (460 nm maximum) emission. The assay is monitored by the blue/green emission ratio. The antagonist assay is performed by seeding the cells into 384 well plates and incubating them 16-24 hours at 37 degrees  C. Test antagonist compounds are added and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 degrees  C. Next an EC80 challenge of U-50488 (OKRK1 agonist) is added and the samples are incubated for 4 hours at 37 degrees  C., followed by addition of CCF4-AM substrate.

1777,Confirmatory,uHTS identification of small molecule agonists of the kappa opioid receptor via a luminescent beta-arrestin assay,"Data Source: Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (SBCCG)_||_Source Affiliation: Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI, San Diego, CA)_||_Network: NIH Molecular Libraries Production Centers Network (MLPCN)_||_Grant Number:  1X01DA026208-01_||_Assay Provider: Dr. Lawrance Barak , Duke University, Durham NC_||_Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds.

1785,Summary,Summary of small molecule antagonists of the kappa opioid receptor,"Data Source: Sanford-Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics (SBCCG)_||_Source Affiliation: Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI, San Diego, CA)_||_Network: NIH Molecular Libraries Production Centers Network (MLPCN)_||_Grant Number:  1X01DA026208-01_||_Assay Provider: Dr. Lawrance Barak , Duke University, Durham NC_||_Drug addiction is a disease originating in the central nervous system that produces compulsive behaviors despite the negative consequences that may result. Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds. _||_This AID summarizes SBCCG's probe development efforts to identify antagonists of the kappa opioid receptor (KOR)._||_From the primary HTS and subsequent hit confirmation (AID 1778) several hit compounds were identified. Hits were clustered into scaffolds and SAR studies were performed on compounds from several scaffolds reconfirming potency (AID 2285). Antagonist activity was further confirmed for these compounds via image-based high content assays (AID 2348). Compounds were further tested for selectivity against the related delta (AID 2357) and mu opioid receptors (AID 2420). A novel scaffold was identified as a KOR antagonist, with CID3342390 (ML140) representing a very potent and selective member of the chemical series. This antagonist compound was later nominated to probe candidacy status._||_As second novel more potent antagonist (120 nM by DiscoveRx) for the kappa opioid (KOP) receptor that is >267-fold selective over the mu(MOP) and the delta(DOP) opioid receptors is CID44665680 (ML190). Importantly, this probe and its analogs represent a novel chemical class compared to current literature antagonists and our previously submitted probe, ML140. Accordingly, this probe and its analogues may serve as interesting tools to advance addiction research. Additionally, this new chemotype is less complicated compared to known KOP receptor antagonist compounds. The structure contains no stereochemical centers and the short, versatile synthetic route enables both the synthesis of potential analogs and the production of the compound on larger scale._||_Details of protocols, compound structures, and results from the original assays can be found in PubChem at the respective AIDs listed below.",14,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,BCCG-A206-KOR-Antagonist-Summary-Assay,20110622,3342390|44665680,87218794|88442997,4986,NULL,NP_000903,NIH Initiatives,1664548|7483322|7592342|7649270|7890732|8137953|8574585|8585130|9022829|9346876|12954747|15090153|15090178|15289816|15525797|15542743|15935455|16353938|16353947|16483675|16924269|17105950,0,NULL,P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission.

1921,Other,Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Colleen Niswender_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator(PAM)_||_Grant Number: MH077607-1_||_To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

Major addictive drugs of abuse include components of tobacco, opiates, marijuana, ethanol, cocaine, and derivatives of amphetamines. While the addictive behaviors produced by these substances may be generally similar, the drugs act at different receptor sites in the brain. Recent studies have shown that opioid receptors play a role regulating the addictive behaviors of other receptors that interact with illicit and legal substances of abuse. Opioid receptors are composed of multiple subtypes whose contributions to addictive behaviors are not fully delineated. Moreover, different compounds acting at a single receptor type may produce dissimilar behaviors due to variations in their chemical structures. Thus, both for delineating the biology and signaling ability of each receptor and for developing novel therapies, it would be desirable to identify multiple small molecule ligands that target a given receptor subtype. This entails expanding the chemical space about each of the receptors as variations in receptor conformations due to distinct ligand structures affect receptor signaling behaviors, and consequently physiological responsiveness. Morphine is a prime example of an opioid ligand with distinctive signaling properties. _||_The specific aim of this project is to identify subtype specific small molecule agonists of the human kappa opioid receptor (KOR). These compounds can be optimized to provide the pharmacological means to precisely control the signaling of their specific target receptor subtype. This work thus provides the addiction field both novel research tools and potential therapeutic scaffolds.

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_Summary of Probe Development Effort:_||_This probe development effort is focused on the identification of antagonists the kappa 1 (OPRMK)opioid receptor.
