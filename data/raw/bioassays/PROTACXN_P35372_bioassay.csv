While the thieno[2,3-c]pyridazine core has been a consistent feature of key M PAMs, no work had previously been reported with respect to alternate functionality at the C3 position of the pyridazine ring. Here, we detail new chemistry and analogs that explored this region, and quickly led to VU6005806/AZN-00016130, which was profiled as a putative candidate. While, the β-amino carboxamide moiety engendered solubility limited absorption in higher species precluding advancement (or requiring extensive pharmaceutical sciences formulation), VU6005806/AZN-00016130 represents a new, high quality preclinical in vivo probe.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4667528,20220318,134263768,461557059,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31113706,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

We recently reported the phenyl-cyclohexyl-piperazine cis-22a as the first submicromolar TRPV6 inhibitor. This inhibitor showed a seven-fold selectivity against the closely related calcium channel TRPV5 and no activity on store-operated calcium channels (SOC), but very significant off-target effects and low microsomal stability. Here, we surveyed analogues incorporating structural features of the natural product capsaicin and identified 3OG, a new oxygenated analog with similar potency against TRPV6 (IC50 = 0.082 +/- 0.004 microM) and ion channel selectivity, but with high microsomal stability and very low off-target effects. This natural product-inspired inhibitor does not exhibit any non-specific toxicity effects on various cell lines and is proposed as a new tool compound to test pharmacological inhibition of TRPV6 mediated calcium flux in disease models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4680558,20220318,155804579,461516429,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,33479695,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

For the OC linkage compounds, 1g showed the most potent FFA4 agonistic activity with a pEC of 5.81 ± 0.04 and exhibited at least 64-fold selectivity against FFA1. For SO2-N linkage agonists, 2m had a pEC of 5.66 ± 0.04 and displayed>46-fold selectivity against FFA1. Among these two series of compounds, 1g was the most potent agonist at FFA4 and the best selectivity against FFA1, demonstrated by docking simulation. Moreover, 1g showed receptor selectivity on other seven GPCRs. In anti-diabetic evaluation, 1g dose-dependently reduced blood glucose, which was better than a clinical phase III drug TAK875.

The compounds were tested in signal transduction assays (ERK1/2 phosphorylation, cAMP inhibition, Ca mobilization, and β-arrestin recruitment) which identified ERK1/2 phosphorylation-preferring aryloxyethyl derivatives. The novel series showed high 5-HT receptor affinity, >1000-fold selectivity versus noradrenergic α, dopamine D, serotonin 5-HT, histamine H, and muscarinic M receptors, and favorable druglike properties (CNS-MPO, Fsp, LELP). The lead structure, (3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)(4-fluoro-4-(((2-(pyridin-2-yloxy)ethyl)amino)methyl)piperidin-1-yl)methanone (17, NLX-204), displayed high selectivity in the SafetyScreen44 panel (including hERG channel), high solubility, metabolic stability, and Caco-2 penetration and did not block CYP3A4, CYP2D6 isoenzymes, or P-glycoprotein. Preliminary in vivo studies confirmed its promising pharmacokinetic profile. 17 also robustly stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation in rat cortex and showed highly potent (MED = 0.16 mg/kg) and efficacious antidepressant-like activity, totally eliminating immobility in the rat Porsolt test. These data suggest that the present 5-HT receptor-biased agonists could constitute promising antidepressant drug candidates.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4707395,20220318,132256735,461530079,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30721053,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

MGS0008 is a highly hydrophilic glutamate analog and is therefore expected to show low oral bioavailability in humans. To improve the oral bioavailability of MGS0008, ester prodrugs of MGS0008 were synthesized and their usefulness was evaluated. Among the prodrugs, the l-menthol-ester prodrug 4h demonstrated preferable lipophilicity, good chemical stability, and a high conversion rate to MGS0008 in human and monkey liver microsomes. A pharmacokinetic study in monkeys revealed that the oral bioavailability of MGS0008 after oral dosing of compound 4h was approximately 15-fold higher than that after oral dosing of MGS0008. Based on these findings, a diastereomer of compound 4h (compound 4j, or MGS0274), was selected as a candidate for clinical drug development, and its besylate is currently under development for the treatment of schizophrenia (Development code: TS-134).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4708814,20220318,9815616|72550767,103348150|461556274,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32698110,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, several neurological complications are now being seen in these patients due to HIV-1 associated injury of neurons by infected microglia and astrocytes. In addition, these effects can be further exacerbated with opiate use and abuse. One possible mechanism for such potentiation effects of opiates is the interaction of the mu opioid receptor (MOR) with the chemokine receptor CCR5 (CCR5), a known HIV-1 co-receptor, to form MOR-CCR5 heterodimer. In an attempt to understand this putative interaction and its relevance to neuroAIDS, we designed and synthesized a series of bivalent ligands targeting the putative CCR5-MOR heterodimer. To understand how these bivalent ligands may interact with the heterodimer, biological studies including calcium mobilization inhibition, binding affinity, HIV-1 invasion, and cell fusion assays were applied. In particular, HIV-1 infection assays using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, macrophages, and astrocytes revealed a notable synergy in activity for one particular bivalent ligand. Further, a molecular model of the putative CCR5-MOR heterodimer was constructed, docked with the bivalent ligand, and molecular dynamics simulations of the complex was performed in a membrane-water system to help understand the biological observation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4719349,20220318,5360515|71460188|90666576|162645606|162650661|162660215|162660784|162674876,131283791|163333807|242614426|461518223|461525405|461538971|461539772|461559880,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27720326,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Numerous SAR studies have revealed that the Arg residue is essential for KOR activity. In contrast, our systematic SAR studies on [des-Arg]Dyn A analogues found that Arg is not a key residue and even deletion of the residue does not affect biological activities at the KOR. In addition, it was also found that [des-Arg]Dyn A(1-9)-NH is a minimum pharmacophore and its modification at the N-terminus leads to selective KOR antagonists.

The σ receptor is implicated in modulating learning, memory, emotion, sensory systems, neuronal development, and cognition and accordingly is now an actively pursued drug target for various neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Evaluation of the five selective σ receptor drug candidates (pridopidine, ANAVEX2-73, SA4503, S1RA, and T-817MA) that have entered clinical trials has shown that reaching clinical approval remains an evasive and important goal.

KOR agonists have been proved to be strong analgesics without MOR agonist-related side effects, such as respiratory depression, tolerance, and dependence liability; however, activation of KOR in the central nervous system (CNS) may cause sedation and anxiety. It has been reported that peripheral KOR activation produces comparable bioactivity without CNS-related side effects.

Bioisosterism is widely employed in the rational modification of lead compounds, being used to increase potency, enhance selectivity, improve pharmacokinetic properties, eliminate toxicity, and acquire novel chemical space to secure intellectual property. The introduction of a bioisostere leads to structural changes in molecular size, shape, electronic distribution, polarity, pK, dipole or polarizability, which can be either favorable or detrimental to biological activity. This approach has opened up new avenues in drug design and development resulting in more efficient drug candidates introduced onto the market as well as in the clinical pipeline.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2.

148347,Confirmatory,Tested for effective concentration against cloned human Opioid receptor mu 1,"Title: The power of visual imagery in drug design. Isopavines as a new class of morphinomimetics and their human opioid receptor binding activity._||_Abstract: The importance of visual imagery and relational thinking manifests itself in a heuristic approach to the design and synthesis of potential morphinomimetics as agonists of the human mu receptor. The well-known class of alkaloids represented by the isopavine nucleus has a topological resemblance to the morphine skeleton, especially when viewed in a particular way. Enantiopure isopavines can be readily obtained from a 1,2 Stevens rearrangement of 13-substituted dihydromethanodibenzoazocines, prepared in four steps from d- and l-amino acids. Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor. X-ray crystal structures of several compounds corroborate stereochemistries and overall topologies.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749738,20181017,10366960,318464393,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12502358,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The 8-amino group was hypothesized to be a replacement for the prototypic 8-OH substituent for 2,6-methano-3-benzazocines and related opiates. This OH group is generally required for binding yet is implicated in unfavorable pharmacokinetic characteristics such as low oral bioavailability and rapid clearance via O-glucuronidation. The core structures in which the 8-OH group was replaced were cyclazocine and its enantiomers, ethylketocyclazocine and its enantiomers, ketocyclazocine, and Mr2034. Many new analogues had high affinity for opioid receptors with several in the subnanomolar range. Highest affinity was seen in analogues with secondary 8-(hetero)arylamino appendages. Binding to opioid receptors was enantioselective with the (2R,6R,11R)-configuration preferred and high selectivity for mu and kappa over delta opioid receptors was observed within the series.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749741,20181017,5359966|9897164|10078468|10462426|11204993|11239327|11262815|11308721|11364225|11434336,103230838|103393362|103393363|103393415|103393930|103393960|103393961|103394107|103394260|103394266,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Andrews analysis of the NIH nonpeptide lead SNC-80 suggested the removal of substituents not predicted to contribute to binding. This approach led to a simplified lead, N, N-diethyl-4-[phenyl(1-piperazinyl)methyl]benzamide (1), which retained potent binding affinity and selectivity to the human delta receptor (IC(50) = 11 nM, mu/delta = 740, kappa/delta > 900) and potency as a full agonist (EC(50) = 36 nM) but had a markedly reduced molecular weight, only one chiral center, and increased in vitro metabolic stability. From this lead, the key pharmacophore groups for delta receptor affinity and activation were more clearly defined by SAR and mutagenesis studies. Further structural modifications on the basis of 1 confirmed the importance of the N, N-diethylbenzamide group and the piperazine lower basic nitrogen for delta binding, in agreement with mutagenesis data. A number of piperazine N-alkyl substituents were tolerated. In contrast, modifications of the phenyl group led to the discovery of a series of diarylmethylpiperazines exemplified by N, N-diethyl-4-[1-piperazinyl(8-quinolinyl)methyl]benzamide (56) which had an improved in vitro binding profile (IC(50) = 0.5 nM, mu/delta = 1239, EC(50) = 3.6 nM) and increased in vitro metabolic stability compared to SNC-80.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749744,20181016,119029|123924|9801260|10501573|10525105|10525171|10546813|10569964|10598391|10598392|10618862|10620493|10642101|10644815|10644995|10690216|10713071|10739828|10760345|10762996|10786358|11742939|11793476|11794240|11794241,103175041|103193996|103195093|103357906|103357926|103357928|103358388|103358395|103358650|103358759|103358761|103358787|103358800|103358801|103358819|103358978|103358980|103358981|103358983|103359077|103359106|103359152|103359153|103359187|163319402,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11052793,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Unexpected O3-dealkylation in the opioid radioligand displacement assay._||_Abstract: O3-(2-Carbomethoxyallyl) ether derivatives of some phenolic 4,5-epoxymorphinan opioid ligands have been prepared in a simple one-step procedure, and their behavior in the radioligand receptor assay was compared to their phenolic precursors. These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand. We conclude that the conversion of the O3(2-carbomethoxyallyl) ether electrophilic ligands to their parent phenols accounts for their activity in the opioid radioligand displacement assay.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754005,20181013,1223|443408|644209|5284596|5284604|5360515|5480230|5486554|5497186|10026312|10046467|10321082|10346220|10350630|10414887|10455862|10455974|10459444|10481516,103170037|103189159|103250876|103279059|103381210|103381309|103381569|103381570|103381656|103381934|103381936|103381980|103382010|103416406|103697951|103698780|131283791|160708234|242084509,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1335078,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

Evidence which suggests that mu and delta opioid receptors possess different stereochemical requirements._||_Abstract: Enantiomers of erythro-5-methylmethadone (3) were synthesized from optical antipodes of erythro-3-(dimethyl-amino)-2-butanol. X-ray crystallographic analysis of (-)-3 perchlorate revealed that it possesses the 5S,6S absolute configuration. It was found that (-)-3 is substantially more potent than its enantiomer (+)-3 as an opioid agonist in vivo and in vitro. In vitro tests (guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle and mouse vas deferens preparations) suggest that (-)-3 mediates its effect chiefly through mu opioid receptors. On the other hand, (+)-3 and the more potent enantiomers of methadone, (-)-1, and isomethadone, (-)-2, appear to have less mu-receptor selectivity and interact with a greater fraction of delta receptors than does (-)-3. The fact that the solid-state conformation of (-)-3 differs from that of (-)-1 and (-)-2, which show great similarity in conformational features, suggests that mu and delta receptors have different conformational requirements. The possibility of different modes of interaction with a single opioid receptor population also is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756116,20200630,643985|12358631|12807058|44374038,103411244|103411274|103411298|103411305,4985|4986|4988,In vitro,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6284938,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244. The cis fused, 4,5 dimethyl ether substituted cyclohexane analogue trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzo[b]thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (32) has high in vitro kappa opioid receptor affinity (Ki = 16 nM) and equipotent analgesic activity to morphine after iv administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755059,20200628,13911081|13911085|45260009|45260011|45260017|45260026|45260036|45263803|45264200|45264340|45264344|45264364|45264368|45264405,103221766|103670691|103670693|103670701|103670723|103670738|103670767|103676268|103676905|103677136|103677142|103677166|103677173|103677221,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2567782,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

This drug also possesses potent activity at several other brain receptors (most notably alpha 1 adrenergic receptors). We have prepared the enantiomers and diastereomers of ifenprodil along with a series of partial structures in order to explore the basic structure activity relations within this class of compounds. From this study, it is clear that alpha 1 adrenergic and NMDA receptor activities may be separated by selection of the threo relative stereochemistry. Examination of the optical isomers of threo-ifenprodil (2) reveals that no further improvement in receptor selectivity is gained from either antipode. Individual removal of most of the structural fragments from the ifenprodil molecule generally results in less active compounds although fluorinated derivative 9 with threo relative stereochemistry is somewhat more potent and substantially more selective for the NMDA receptor. Finally a minimum structure for activity in this series (14) has been identified. This stripped-down version of ifenprodil possesses nearly equivalent affinity for the NMDA receptor with no selectivity over alpha 1 adrenergic receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755061,20181013,3689,124960908,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1681106,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

However in this series of 14beta-cinnamoylamino derivatives the codeinones (e.g. methoclocinnamox, MC-CAM) had unexpectedly high mu-opioid receptor affinity, similar to that of the morphinone (clocinnamox, C-CAM). The current report relates to the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of deoxyclocinnamox (DOC-CAM) which acted as a high-affinity opioid antagonist similar to C-CAM but with greater mu selectivity. Thus it appears that the C(3)-substituent does not play a major role in the binding of the 14beta-cinnamoyl series and that the cinnamoyl group itself may in fact be the dominant binding feature.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755063,20181016,6540640|44417373,103500772|103500889,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10966754,0,NULL,P35372,9527,NULL,,NULL

In a previous report we had described the unique biological characteristics of this ligand and also a need for further structural evaluation.(6) To pursue this, we have introduced a completely different heterocyclic template (2 and 3), which, based on molecular modeling studies, may present the required structural features to properly orient the pharmacophore groups. We also have made more subtle changes to the original piperazine scaffold (5 and 11). The biological activities of these compounds revealed an important participation of the scaffold in the ligand-receptor interaction. To further explore functional diversity on the scaffold, we have maintained the original piperazine ring and introduced four different functionalities at position 2 of the heterocyclic ring (15a-d; a = CH(2)-O-CH(2)-Ph; b = Me; c = CH(2)Ph; d = CH(2)OH). The biological activities observed for these compounds showed a very interesting trend in terms of the steric effects of the groups introduced at this position. A decrease of almost 2000-fold in affinity and potency at the delta-receptor was observed for 15c compared with 15b. This difference may be explained if we postulate that the bioactive conformation of these peptidomimetics is close to the minimal energy conformations calculated in our study. On the basis of these findings we have realized the importance of this position to further explore and simplify the structure of future generations of peptidomimetic ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755554,20181016,10503458,103396536,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10639279,0,NULL,P35372,9823,NULL,,NULL

These enantiomers, (-)- and (+)-4.HCl, were prepared by esterification of the corresponding alcohols, (+)- and (-)-4a. Single crystal X-ray studies of (-)-4a.HCl reveal that it possesses the 2R,4S absolute configuration. Analgetic testing in mice (hot-plate) and receptor binding studies indicate that (-)-(2S,4R)-4.HCl is approximately ten times more potent than its enantiomer. The results are consistent with the operation of the Ogston effect in the interaction of achiral 4-phenylpiperidines with opioid receptors. Additionally, it is suggested that the piperidine ring of these and other closely related 4-phenylpiperidines bind within a receptor subsite cleft whose dimensions exclude diequatorial 2,6- and 3,5-dimethyl-substituted ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755152,20181002,4741130|6542471|44272414,103184211|103184536|160686191,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6283082,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding. However, a relationship involving the hydrophobic character of the N-substituent is discussed.

These agents were prepared to obtain electrophilic opioid ligands potentially useful in the characterization of opioid receptors and drug-receptor interactions. Preparation of these ligands was accomplished from 3-O-trityl-6 beta-naltrexol (13) via phase transfer-catalyzed alkylation of the regioisomeric o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzyl halides and the o-, m-, and p-cyanobenzyl halides. The intermediates were deprotected and reduced, and formation of the isothiocyanates from the corresponding amines completed the synthesis. The ligands (6-11) were tested in radioligand displacement assays in guinea pig brain homogenate for opioid receptor binding affinity and irreversibility. All six of the isothiocyanates demonstrated significant affinity in the displacement assays for all three opioid receptors. They also appeared to be irreversibly bound at each of the receptor types.

150241,Literature-derived,Agonistic activity towards Opioid receptors in the guinea pig ileum; ND means No data,"Title: Structure-activity relationships of dynorphin a analogues modified in the address sequence._||_Abstract: The peptide [Pro3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 2 exhibits high affinity (K(i) = 2.4 nM) and over 2000-fold selectivity for the opioid receptor. Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM).

Synthesis and evaluation of N-alkyl-substituted (alpha-piperazinylbenzyl)benzamides as novel, highly selective delta opioid receptor agonists._||_Abstract: A series of N-alkyl- and N,N-dialkyl-4-[alpha-[(2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl] benzyl]-benzamides were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor subtypes. Several compounds (2e,f,h,i,m) strongly bound to the delta receptor with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. On the other hand, the binding affinities of these compounds for the mu and kappa receptors were in the micromolar or greater range indicating excellent delta opioid receptor subtype selectivities. In this series, two important structure-activity relationships were found for the delta receptor binding affinity. First, the spatial orientation of the alpha-benzylic position influenced the affinities with the alpha R derivatives 2a-n generally showing more than 10-fold greater affinity than the alpha S derivatives 3a-n. Second, the binding affinities were strongly influenced by the number of alkyl substituents on the amide nitrogen. N-Monoalkylbenzamide derivatives 2b-d showed lower affinity than N,N-dialkylbenzamide derivatives 2e-n, and the N-unsubstituted benzamide derivative 2a had the lowest affinity for the delta receptor in the series. The dramatic effect of the amide group substitution pattern on the binding affinity for the delta receptor strongly suggests that the amide function is an important structural element in the interaction of this series of compounds at the delta receptor. Selective compounds in this series were examined for binding affinity in cloned human mu and delta receptors. The results obtained generally paralleled those from the rat brain binding assay. Compounds 2e,f with potent delta binding affinities and high delta selectivities were shown to be delta agonists with high selectivity by studies in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

150845,Confirmatory,Binding affinity against Opioid receptor mu 1,"Title: Molecular docking reveals a novel binding site model for fentanyl at the mu-opioid receptor._||_Abstract: The ligand binding modes of a series of fentanyl derivatives are examined using a combination of conformational analysis and molecular docking to the mu-opioid receptor. Condensed-phase molecular dynamics simulations are applied to evaluate potential relationships between ligand conformation and fentanyl substitution and to generate probable 'bioactive' structures for the ligand series. Automated docking of the largely populated solution conformers identified a common binding site orientation that places the N-phenethyl group of fentanyl deep in a crevice between transmembrane (TM) helices II and III while the N-phenylpropanamide group projected toward a pocket formed by TM-III, -VI, and -VII domains. An analysis of the binding modes indicates the most potent fentanyl derivatives adopt an extended conformation both in solution and in the bound state, suggesting binding affinity may depend on the conformational preferences of the ligands. The results are consistent with ligand binding data derived from chimeric and mutant receptor studies as well as structure-activity relationship data reported on a wide range of fentanyl analogues. The binding site model is also compared to that of N-phenethylnormorphine. An overlay of the bound conformation of the opiate and cis-3-methylfentanyl shows the N-phenethyl groups occupy equivalent binding domains in the receptor. While the cationic amines of both ligand classes were found docked to an established anchor site (D149 in TM-III), no overlap was observed between the N-phenylpropanamide group and the remaining components of the opiate scaffold. The unique binding mode(s) proposed for the fentanyl series may, in part, explain the difficulties encountered in defining models of recognition at the mu-receptor and suggest opioid receptors may display multiple binding epitopes. Furthermore, the results provide new insight to the design of experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis to the differential selectivities of ligands at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751574,20181017,3345|62156|124716|3041260|9976188|10021831|10428991,103173010|103182112|103224159|103349831|103349832|103349834|103734588,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10669565,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The most striking finding was the very large difference in kappa-opioid receptor activity between the diastereomeric ethyl ethers: 46-fold in binding, 150-fold in GPI, and 900-fold in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay in favor of the (R)-diastereomer. Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact. It appears that kappa-agonist binding of the orvinols avoids the inhibitory site in the intramolecular H-bonded conformation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751576,20181017,71450939,163316075,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10794701,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,197,,NULL

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751580,20181017,105104|5288826|5497186|10430432|10645976|15548354|15548355|44349947|71456174|73346599|73349647|73352661,103169185|103177815|103357118|103357774|103357911|103697951|163322761|163326190|163326191|174489426|174499610|174509985,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260).

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors. These novel ligands, as well as their interesting pharmacological properties, will serve as the basis for our continuing investigation of the dimeric ligands as potential probes for the pharmacotherapy of cocaine abuse and may also open new avenues for the characterization of opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753407,20181017,60768|5359272|5359966|9804450|9897164|10078468|10462426|11158498|11181676|11204993|11239327|11262815|11307039|11308699|11308721|11364225|11365113|11388486|11411315|11434336|44365804,103230837|103230838|103316363|103393362|103393363|103393415|103393416|103393419|103393420|103393421|103393930|103393960|103393961|103394107|103394260|103394264|103394265|103394266|103394653|103394654|123085530,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14613319,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,197,,NULL

In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873929,20181017,443408|5480230|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734675|103735456,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,NULL,P35372,9527,207,,NULL

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757310,20181016,132913|134131,103310030|103310529,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

For many years efforts to obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo.

Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys.

The present study describes the synthesis and SAR of dihydropyrimidinones linked to substituted 4-phenylpiperazine containing side chains.

Approaches to eliminate opioid agonist metabolites via modification of linker and 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety._||_Abstract: We have previously described compound 1a as a high-affinity subtype selective alpha(1a) antagonist. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of compound 1a showed its major metabolite to be a mu-opioid agonist, 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine (3). Several dihydropyrimidinone analogues were synthesized with the goal of either minimizing the formation of 3 by modification of the linker or finding alternative piperidine moieties which when cleaved as a consequence of metabolism would not give rise to mu-opioid activity. Modification of the linker gave several compounds with good alpha(1a) binding affinity (K(i) = < 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d)). In vitro analysis in the microsomal assay revealed these modifications did not significantly affect N-dealkylation and the formation of the piperidine 3. The second approach, however, yielded several piperidine replacements for 3, which did not show significant mu-opioid activity. Several of these compounds maintained good affinity at the alpha(1a) adrenoceptor and selectivity over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d). For example, the piperidine fragments of (+)-73 and (+)-83, viz. 4-cyano-4-phenylpiperidine and 4-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine, were essentially inactive at the mu-opioid receptor (IC(50) > 30 microM vs 3 microM for 3). Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 were subjected to detailed in vitro and in vivo characterization. Both these compounds, in addition to their excellent selectivity (>880-fold) over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d), also showed good selectivity over several other recombinant human G-protein coupled receptors. Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 showed good functional potency in isolated human prostate tissues, with K(b)s comparable to their in vitro alpha(1a) binding data.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244. The cis fused, 4,5 dimethyl ether substituted cyclohexane analogue trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[4,5-dimethoxy-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]-benzo[b]thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (32) has high in vitro kappa opioid receptor affinity (Ki = 16 nM) and equipotent analgesic activity to morphine after iv administration in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758208,20200628,18607196,103670678,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2567782,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Docking studies with 3-D models of the hNK-3 and hNK-2 receptors were used to drive the chemical design and speed up the identification of potent and combined antagonsits at both receptors. (S)-(+)-N-(1-Cyclohexylethyl)-3-[(4-morpholin-4-yl)piperidin-1-yl]methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide (compound 25, SB-400238: hNK-3R binding affinity, K(i) = 0.8 nM; hNK-2R binding affinity, K(i) = 0.8 nM) emerged as the best example in this approach. Further studies led to the identification of (S)-(+)-N-(1,2,2-trimethylpropyl)-3-[(4-piperidin-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]methyl-2-phenylquinoline-4-carboxamide (compound 28, SB-414240: hNK-3R binding affinity, K(i) = 193 nM; hNK-2R binding affinity, K(i) = 1.0 nM) as the first hNK-2R-selective antagonist belonging to the 2-phenylquinoline chemical class. Since some members of this chemical series showed a significant binding affinity for the human mu-opioid receptor (hMOR), docking studies were also conducted on a 3-D model of the hMOR, resulting in the identification of a viable chemical strategy to avoid any significant micro-opioid component. Compounds 25 and 28 are therefore suitable pharmacological tools in the tachykinin area to elucidate further the pathophysiological role of NK-3 and NK-2 receptors and the therapeutic potential of selective NK-2 (28) or combined NK-3 and NK-2 (25) receptor antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757458,20181017,9828448,103228091,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11356103,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,197,,NULL

Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

224713,Confirmatory,Tested for binding activity against mu opioid receptor using [3H]DAMGO ligand,"Title: Synthesis of naltrexone-derived delta-opioid antagonists. Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors. Analogues (3 and 6-8) which were shown to have relatively weak delta-opioid receptor antagonist potency have their aromatic groups located in a space that is different from that of the more potent analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL843459,20181014,5310988|5491688|5497186|6438353|46877673|46877674|46877676|46877677,103316748|103556473|103697951|103734768|103734769|103734771|103734772|103734773,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8126697,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors. The cis-ACCA analogue showed very weak opioid activity (IC50 = 4.0 microM) in the guinea pig ileum.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844034,20181014,25079852|73351482,103173862|174505355,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097539,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS. Such ligands may be useful pharmacologic tools for investigation of peripheral opioid mechanisms. Moreover, they could find clinical applications when the central actions are unwanted.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL845234,20200628,13894004,163333212,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2475628,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

Evidence for the existence of different mu receptor subtypes in different tissues._||_Abstract: A series of beta-funaltrexamine (2, beta-FNA) analogues (3-14) were synthesized that contain a variety of electrophilic groups attached at the 6 beta-position of the opiate. The opioid agonist and antagonist activities of these ligands were evaluated in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) in vitro assays. Several of the compounds behaved like beta-FNA in that they exhibited reversible agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors and irreversible antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. The rank order of irreversible antagonism for a series of related Michael acceptors did not parallel their intrinsic chemical reactivity, confirming that the degree of covalent binding is in part dependent on the spatial disposition of the electrophilic center relative to the receptor nucleophile (secondary recognition). The maleimidoacetamide 8 behaved very differently from beta-FNA in that it exhibited considerably greater irreversible mu antagonism in MVD relative to the mu blockage in the GPI.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin.

N,N-Dialkylated and N-monoalkylated (alkyl = allyl, benzyl, and cyclopropylmethyl (CPM) tyrosine derivatives were prepared from tyrosine tert-butyl ester and the corresponding alkyl halides. [D-Pro10]Dyn A-(2-11) was prepared by solid phase synthesis using Fmoc-protected amino acids, and the tyrosine derivatives were coupled to the peptide with BOP ((benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate). Both the degree of substitution and the identity of the alkyl group affected kappa-receptor affinity, selectivity, and efficacy. All of the N-monoalkylated derivatives exhibited much higher affinity (Ki < 0.05 nM) for kappa receptors in the guinea pig cerebellum and greatly enhanced kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu) > 200) compared to the N,N-dialkyl [D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11) analogues, although one disubstituted analogue, N,N-diCPM[D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11), retained high affinity (Ki = 0.19 nM) for kappa receptors. Thus the introduction of the second alkyl group at the N-terminus lowered kappa-receptor affinity and selectivity. The N-allyl and N-CPM analogues were moderately potent agonists in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) assay, while the N-benzyl derivative was a weak agonist in this assay. In vivo in the phenylquinone abdominal stretching assay the N-CPM analogue exhibited potent antinociceptive activity (ED50 = 1.1 micrograms/mouse), while N-allyl[D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11) exhibited weak antinociceptive activity (ED50 = 27 micrograms/mouse). For the N,N-dialkyl derivatives the identity of the N-terminal alkyl group affected the efficacy observed in the smooth muscle assays. The N,N-diCPM analogue exhibited negligible agonist activity, and N,N-diallyl[D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11) showed weak antagonist activity against Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 in the GPI.

231577,Literature-derived,Receptor selectivity index is the ratio of the apparent KI at mu opioid receptor over the apparent KI at the highest affinity site,"Title: Synthesis and biological activities of dynorphin A analogues with opioid antagonist properties._||_Abstract: Dynorphin A, which displays a wide variety of physiological effects, binds to opioid receptors preferentially at the kappa receptor type. kappa-selective antagonists would be very useful as pharmacological and biochemical probes to study and better understand the action of dynorphin A at its preferred receptor. However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852600,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively).

The methyloctahydroisoquinolines 6a-g can exist in conformations where the 3-hydroxyphenyl substituent is either axial or equatorial, similar to the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines 4. The 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is responsible for the antagonist activity observed in the (3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine antagonists. Single-crystal X-ray analysis of 6a shows that the 3-hydroxyphenyl equatorial conformation is favored in the solid state. Molecular modeling studies also suggest that the equatorial conformation has lower potential energy relative to that of the axial conformation.

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process.

On these bases we synthesised and evaluated pharmacologically in the mouse vas deferens assay a series of N/OFQ-NH(2) analogues substituted in position 7 and 11 with Calpha,alpha-disubstituted cyclic, linear and branched amino acids. None of the 20 novel N/OFQ analogues produced better results than [Aib(7)]N/OFQ-NH(2). Thus, this substitution was combined with other chemical modifications known to modulate peptide potency and/or efficacy generating compound 21 [Nphe(1)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (coded as UFP-111), compound 22 [(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-112) and compound 23 [Phe(1)Psi(CH(2)-NH)Gly(2)(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-113).

Three of the 10 compounds, (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-9-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl-2-phenylethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10), (1R,5S)-(+)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methylene-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S)-(+)-14), and (1R,5S,9R)-(-)-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-9-methyl-2-phenethyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonane ((1R,5S,9R)-(+)-15) had subnanomolar affinity at mu-opioid receptors (Ki = 0.19, 0.19, and 0.63 nM, respectively). The (1R,5S)-(+)-14 was found to be a mu-opioid agonist and a mu-, delta-, and kappa-antagonist in [35S]GTP-gamma-S assays and was approximately 50 times more potent than morphine in a number of acute and subchronic pain assays, including thermal and visceral models of nociception. The (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 compound with a C9-hydroxy substituent axially oriented to the piperidine ring (C9beta-hydroxy) was a mu-agonist about 500 times more potent than morphine. In the single-dose suppression assay, it was greater than 1000 times more potent than morphine. It is the most potent known phenylmorphan antinociceptive. The molecular structures of these compounds were energy minimized with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G* level and then overlaid onto (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-10 using the heavy atoms in the morphan moiety as a common docking point.

On the basis of its high delta selectivity, H-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH (reference compound 1) is a useful starting point for the synthesis of (18)F-labeled compounds prepared by the coupling of N-succinimidyl 4-[ (18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) with Boc-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH under slightly basic conditions at 37 degrees C for 15 min, deprotection with TFA, and HPLC purification. The total synthesis time was 120 min, and the decay-corrected radiochemical yield of [(18)F]- 1 was about 25-30% ( n = 5) starting from [(18)F]SFB ( n = 5) with an effective specific activity about 46 GBq/micromol. In vitro autoradiography studies showed prominent uptake of [ (18)F]- 1 in the striatum and cortex with significant blocking by 1 and UFP-501 (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), suggesting high specific binding of [(18)F]- 1 to delta-opioid receptors. Noninvasive microPET imaging studies revealed the absence of [(18)F]- 1 in rat brain, since it fails to cross the blood-brain barrier. This study demonstrates the suitability of [ (18)F]- 1 for imaging peripheral delta-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL950325,20181023,71720208,164147222,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18311909,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1013976,20181024,5284596,103170037,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

As a hydrolase, LTA 4H stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of the unstable epoxide LTA 4 to the diol LTB 4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and a chemoattractant of eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening. From this work we identified a series of benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzimidazole inhibitors.

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970717,20181026,5497186|15307413|24949529|24949532|24949683|24949684|24949687|24949689,103586336|103587313|103622354|103622355|103622440|103623454|103623455|103697951,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

To identify a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors, we used the recently described conformation-state sensitive antibodies and screened a panel of endogenous peptides from rodent brain or adipose tissue. This led to the identification of hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH) as a peptide ligand that selectively binds CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. We find that hemopressin is a CB(1) receptor-selective antagonist, because it is able to efficiently block signaling by CB(1) receptors but not by other members of family A G protein-coupled receptors (including the closely related CB(2) receptors). Hemopressin also behaves as an inverse agonist of CB(1) receptors, because it is able to block the constitutive activity of these receptors to the same extent as its well characterized antagonist, rimonabant. Finally, we examine the activity of hemopressin in vivo using different models of pain and find that it exhibits antinociceptive effects when administered by either intrathecal, intraplantar, or oral routes, underscoring hemopressin's therapeutic potential. These results represent a demonstration of a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors that also exhibits analgesic properties.

In order to investigate structural requirements for position 2, we synthesized endomorphin analogs incorporating, instead of Pro, unnatural amino acids with six-membered heterocyclic rings, such as piperidine 2-, 3- or 4-carboxylic acids (Pip, Nip and Inp, respectively). (R)-Nip residue turned out to be favourable for improving MOR affinity. Introduction of 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) instead of Tyr(1) led to obtaining [Dmt(1), (R)-Nip(2)]EM-2 which showed exceptional MOR affinity and high stability against enzymatic degradation in rat brain homogenate. In in vivo hot-plate test in mice, this analog given intracerebroventicularly (i.c.v.), produced profound supraspinal analgesia, being much more potent than EM-2.

We conducted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies on COS cells coexpressing MOP and CCK2 receptors to determine whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in such modulation. These studies revealed the absence of constitutive or monovalent ligand-induced heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of MOP and CCK2 receptors therefore is unlikely to be responsible for the opposing effects between morphine and CCK in the CNS. However, association was induced, as indicated by a positive BRET signal, on exposure of the cells to bivalent ligands containing mu-opioid agonist and CCK2 receptor antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers containing 16-22 atoms but not with a shorter (9-atom) spacer. These studies demonstrate for the first time that an appropriately designed bivalent ligand is capable of inducing association of G-protein-coupled receptors. The finding that opioid tolerance studies with these ligands in mice showed no correlation with the BRET data is consistent with the absence of association of MOP and CCK2 receptors in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1021531,20181026,5462471|44580898|44580899|44580900|44580901|44580932,103217856|103628240|103628241|103628242|103628243|103628328,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19113864,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,197,,NULL

476639,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu opioid receptor,"Title: 'Carba'-analogues of fentanyl are opioid receptor agonists._||_Abstract: There is evidence to indicate that the Asp residue in the third transmembrane helix (TMH) of opioid receptors forms a salt bridge with the positively charged nitrogen of endogenous and exogenous opioid ligands. To further examine the role of this electrostatic interaction in receptor binding and activation, we synthesized 'carba'-analogues of a published fentanyl analogue containing a 3-(guanidinomethyl)-benzyl group in place of the phenyl moiety attached to the ethylamido group (C. Dardonville et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2006, 14, 6570-6580 (1)), in which the piperidine ring nitrogen was replaced with a carbon. As expected, the resulting cis and trans isomers (8a and 8b) showed reduced mu and kappa opioid receptor binding affinities as compared to 1 but, surprisingly, retained opioid full agonist activity with about half the potency of leucine-enkephalin in the guinea pig ileum assay. In conjunction with performed receptor docking studies, these results indicate that the electrostatic interaction of the protonated nitrogen in the piperidine ring of fentanyl analogues with the Asp residue in the third TMH is not a conditio sine qua non for opioid receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1112644,20180913,22810742,103747005,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20218625,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Stereoselective reduction, reductive amination, and Mitsunobu inversions were the key steps for the establishment of the desired stereochemistry. The kappa affinity decreased in the following order depending on the N-substituent: CO(2)CH(3) > benzyl > COCH(2)CH(3). Bicyclic derivatives with (1S,2R,5R)-configuration showed the highest kappa receptor affinity, which led to dihedral angles of 97 degrees and 45 degrees for the N(pyrrolidine)-C-C-N(phenylacetamide) structural element. The most potent kappa agonist of this series was (+)-methyl (1S,2R,5R)-8-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl]-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-6,8-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonane-6-carboxylate (ent-23, WMS-0121) with an K(i) value of 1.0 nM. ent-23 revealed high selectivity against the other classical opioid receptors and related receptor systems. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS-binding assay at human kappa-opioid receptors, ent-23 was proved to be a full agonist with the same EC(50) value (87 nM) as the prototypical full agonist U-69,593 (EC(50) = 80 nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1104720,20180913,46237455|46237583|46237584|46237585|46237703|46237834|46237837,103753542|103753598|103753599|103753643|103753645|103753704|103753705,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20441176,0,NULL,P35372,9606,198,,NULL

These modifications were made mainly on the aryl side of the ester bond to permit possible rapid labeling of the carboxylic acid component with a positron emitter, either carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min), and included (i) replacement of the iodine atom with a small substituent such as nitrile, methyl, or fluoro, (ii) methylation of the 8-amino group, (iii) opening of the dioxan ring, and (iv) alteration of the length of the N-alkyl goup. High-affinity ligands were discovered for recombinant human 5-HT(4) receptors with amenability to labeling with a positron emitter and potential for development as imaging probes. The ring-opened radioligand, (([methoxy-(11)C]1-butylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 4-amino-3-methoxybenzoate; [(11)C]13), showed an especially favorable array of properties for future evaluation as a PET radioligand for brain 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1259918,20180915,49783209|49783415|49783419,123087255|123089475|123092024,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20812727,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Using pharmacophore analysis, we designed and synthesized compounds which bind to both serotonin receptor subtype 1A (5-HT(1A)) and subtype 3 (5-HT(3)). Quinazolinone derivatives with a sulfur atom in the linker showed high affinity in in vitro assays, but low in vivo activity. Focusing on the linker to improve the pharmacokinetic profile, the sulfur atom in the linker was replaced with a methylene group. Further optimization led to the discovery of compound 17m (TZB-30878) ( J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007 , 322 , 1315 - 1323 , Patent WO2005082887 (A1), 2005 ), a novel 5-HT(1A) agonist/5-HT(3) antagonist in the 3-aminoquinazolinone series. In in vivo functional assays, 17m dose dependently inhibited the Bezold-Jarisch reflex and induced 5-HT(1A)-mediated behaviors, and in an IBS animal model, 17m significantly inhibited stress-induced defecation. Pretreatment by WAY-100635 (5-HT(1A) antagonist) significantly attenuated but did not abolish the inhibitory effects of 17m. These results suggested that 17m exerted inhibitory effects via both 5-HT(1A) agonistic and 5-HT(3) antagonistic activities and that 17m would be useful as a therapeutic agent for IBS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1286337,20180915,11430418,123084393,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20931963,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

The secondary amine 10 represents the central building block for the synthesis of more than 25 tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-1-ols. Generally 7-hydroxy derivatives display higher NR2B receptor affinities than the corresponding 7-benzyloxy compounds. A distance of four atoms (five bond lengths) between the basic amino group and the terminal aryl moiety led to highest NR2B affinity. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (WMS-1410, 25) represents the most promising NR2B antagonist of this series showing a K(i)-value of 14nM. Compound 25 reveals excellent selectivity over more than 100 further relevant target proteins, antagonizes glutamate induced excitotoxicity (IC(50)=18.4nM) and is metabolically more stable than ifenprodil.

In the key step of the synthesis 2-bromocinnamaldehyde acetal 5 was added to piperidones 6 with various substituents at the N-atom. Unexpectedly, this reaction led to 2-benzoxepines 8, which were contracted with acid to afford the spirocyclic 2-benzofuranacetaldehydes 9. The best yields were obtained, when the transformations up to the alcohols 10 were performed without isolation of intermediates. Generally the (2-fluoroethyl) derivatives 3 have higher σ(1) affinity and σ(1)/σ(2) selectivity than the corresponding (3-fluoropropyl) derivatives 2. The most promising candidate for the development as radiotracer is the (2-fluoroethyl) derivative 3a (WMS-1828, fluspidine, 1'-benzyl-3-(2-fluoroethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]), which shows subnanomolar σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.59nM) and excellent selectivity over the σ(2) subtype (1331-fold) as well as some other receptor systems. The novel synthetic strategy also allows the systematic pharmacological evaluation of intermediate alcohols 10.

Endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor [or opioid-receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor] are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the immune systems, and peripheral organs, and have a crucial role in the pain sensory system. Indeed, peripheral or intrathecal N/OFQ has displayed antinociceptive activities in neuropathic pain models, and inhibitory effects on pain-related neurotransmitter releases and on synaptic transmissions of C- and Aδ-fibers. In this study, design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of peripheral/spinal cord-targeting non-peptide NOP receptor agonist were investigated for the treatment of neuropathic pain, which resulted in the discovery of highly selective and potent novel NOP receptor full agonist {1-[4-(2-{hexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl}-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]cyclooctyl}methanol 1 (HPCOM) as systemically (subcutaneously) potent new-class analgesic. Thus, 1 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibitory effect against mechanical allodynia in chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain model rats, robust metabolic stability and little hERG potassium ion channel binding affinity, with its unique and potentially safe profiles and mechanisms, which were distinctive from those of N/OFQ in terms of site-differential effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1659149,20200626,49843555|53316968|53316969|53319615|53319617|53322245|53324890|53325608,124956810|124956811|124962100|124962102|124967393|124972650|124972651|124973921,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20875743,0,NULL,P35372,9606,198,,NULL

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets.

Such changes were expected to be almost isosteric with 1, confer greater metabolic resistance, and in the case of the 4-(4-cyanotetrahydro-2H-pyranyl) compounds, substantially reduce lipophilicity. One derivative, 1-(2-bromophenyl)-N-(1-cyanocyclohexyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide (9n), showed high affinity (K(i) = 15.7 nM) and selectivity for binding to CB(1) receptors.

Some other minor structural changes among 9a-s were also found to switch binding selectivity from CB(1) receptors to TSPO or vice versa.

GSNOR is a member of the alcohol dehydrogenase family (ADH) and regulates the levels of S-nitrosothiols (SNOs) through catabolism of S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Reduced levels of GSNO, as well as other nitrosothiols (SNOs), have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including those of the respiratory, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal systems. Preservation of endogenous SNOs through GSNOR inhibition presents a novel therapeutic approach with broad applicability. We describe here the synthesis and structure-activity relationships (SAR) of novel pyrrole based analogues of N6022 focusing on removal of cytochrome P450 inhibition activities.

642499,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu opioid receptor,"Title: Synthesis, radiofluorination and pharmacological evaluation of a fluoromethyl spirocyclic PET tracer for central σ1 receptors and comparison with fluoroalkyl homologs._||_Abstract: The spirocyclic σ(1) receptor ligand 1 (1'-benzyl-3-(fluoromethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was prepared in four steps starting from methoxy derivative 5. Due to its high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.74nM) and selectivity against several other relevant targets, 1 was investigated as (18)F-labeled PET tracer and its biological properties were compared with those of homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 2-4. The fluoromethyl derivative 1 was faster metabolized in vitro than homologs 2-4. In contrast to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]2-4, the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 15 using the K[(18)F]F-K(222)-carbonate complex required heating to 150°C in DMSO to achieve high labeling efficiencies. Whereas radiometabolites of [(18)F]2-4 were not detected in vivo in the brain of mice, two radiometabolites of [(18)F]1 were found. Analysis of ex vivo autoradiography images provided rather low target-to-nontarget ratio for [(18)F]1 compared with [(18)F]2-4. [(18)F]1 showed a fast uptake in the brain, which decreased continuously over time. The brain-to-plasma ratio of the radiotracer [(18)F]1 was only exceeded by the fluoroethyl tracer [(18)F]2.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1941653,20200626,44474938|50994498|56840667|57402462,103697992|124958368|136930451|136943461,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22136765,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis of an N-substituted 4-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan with high affinity and selective μ-antagonist activity._||_Abstract: A simple three-step synthesis of 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-ol (3a) was achieved using an osmium tetroxide mediated oxidation of the known intermediate 6. A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity. The modest change in spatial position of the hydroxyl moiety, and not the N-substituent, induced the change from potent agonist to an antagonist of moderate potency.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1955138,20200626,5284596|57391716|57396944,103170037|136923502|136933180,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22341895,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

Med. Chem.     2011  ,   54  ,   5562 - 5575  ). This new series produced similar potency and selectivity among the NOS isoforms and was devoid of any cardiovascular liabilities associated with QT prolongation due to hERG activity or endothelial NOS mediated vasoconstriction effect. The SAR studies led to the identification of cis-45, which was shown to reverse thermal hyperalgesia in vivo in the spinal nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain with excellent safety profile (off-target activities at 80 CNS related receptors/ion channels/transporters). The results presented in this report make cis-45 as an ideal tool for evaluating the potential role of selective nNOS inhibitors in CNS related disorders where excess NO produced by nNOS is thought to play a crucial role.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1959638,20180921,56924689,136924368,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22175766,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

GSNO and SNOs are implicated in the pathogenesis of many diseases including those in respiratory, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular systems. The pyrrole based N6022 was recently identified as a potent, selective, reversible, and efficacious GSNOR inhibitor which is currently in clinical development for acute asthma.

However, their central administration led to the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Conjugation of C-terminal substance P (SP) fragments to opioids and opioid peptides was previously shown to produce hybrid peptides with strong analgesic activity, with low or no propensity to develop tolerance. In this study, four peptides (2-5) comprised of endomorphin-1 (1) and C-terminal fragments of SP (four or five amino acids, SP(8-11) (2) or SP(7-11) (4), respectively), with an overlapping Phe residue, were synthesized. To overcome low metabolic stability and poor membrane permeability of the peptide, the N-terminus of 2 and 4 was further modified with a C10-carbon lipoamino acid (C10LAA) achieving 3 and 5, respectively. LAA-modification of the hybrid peptides resulted in a significant increase in metabolic stability and membrane permeability compared to peptides 1, 2 and 4. Compound 5 showed potent μ-opioid receptor binding affinity (K(iμ)=3.87 ± 0.51 nM) with dose-dependent agonist activity in the nanomolar range (IC(50)=45 ± 13 nM).

The value of the adamantyl group in drug design is multidimensional. The hydrophobic substituent constant for the adamantyl group has been estimated from the calculated partition coefficients (clogP values) of 31 adamantyl-bearing compounds in the clinic or in development as πadamantyl=3.1, which indicates that the logP value of a compound with high water solubility (logP<<0) could be moved with an adamantyl-based modification to a region that is more clinically useful. The steric bulk of the adamantyl group can: (i) restrict or modulate intramolecular reactivity; and (ii) impede the access of hydrolytic enzymes, thereby increasing drug stability and plasma half life. The value of the adamantyl group in drug design has been recognized most recently in the design of agents to treat iron overload disease (in development), malaria (in clinical trials) and type 2 diabetes (in the clinic).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2174528,20200625,10529438,103390432,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21354674,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The effects of N-substitution (R(1)) and substitutions on the aryl ring (R(2)) were identified as key areas for SAR exploration (Figure 3). Investigation of the effects of varying substituents in both the isoindolinone (2) and benzisothiazolone (3) series led to compounds with improved in vitro potency and/or efficacy. In addition, several analogues exhibited promising pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. Furthermore, compound 2 was shown to dose-dependently decrease nicotine self-administration in rats following oral administration. Our data, showing for the first time efficacy of an mGlu(2) receptor PAM in this in vivo model, suggest potential utility for the treatment of nicotine dependence in humans.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2183940,20180923,46182736|46182745,124957985|124967323,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23009245,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

An alternative and complementary approach is the design of multitargeted modulators simultaneously addressing multiple pathological mechanisms or overcoming pathway robustness. In this study, we propose a methodology to increase the probability of success for developing dual-acting modulators by systematically and rationally evaluating all dual-acting modulator opportunities within a specific disease area. This approach employs a combination of a five-step medicinal chemistry evaluation and a two-step biological analysis to help select the optimal target combination. It provides a novel methodology suitable for widespread application across disease areas. To exemplify the power of this approach, we focus on an analysis of the gastrointestinal (GI) disease area to identify opportunities supported by current literature data.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2319307,20180925,10600310|10839138|71716116|71717930,164127970|164127971|164127972|164136445,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23281966,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

They are activated by the endogenous opioid peptide dynorphin (DYN) and expressed at particularly high levels within brain areas implicated in modulation of motivation, emotion, and cognitive function. Chronic activation of KORs in animal models has maladaptive effects including increases in behaviors that reflect depression, the propensity to engage in drug-seeking behavior, and drug craving. The fact that KOR activation has such a profound influence on behaviors often triggered by stress has led to interest in selective KOR antagonists as potential therapeutic agents. This Perspective provides a description of preclinical research conducted in the development of several different classes of selective KOR antagonists, a summary of the clinical studies conducted thus far, and recommendations for the type of work needed in the future to determine if these agents would be useful as pharmacotherapies for neuropsychiatric illness.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2327129,20200626,44583393|71716193,103634613|164128445,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23360448,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Biosynthetically the structural skeletons of cyclomarinone (1) and maristachones A (2), C (4), D (5a), and E (5b) are most unusual due to the presence of an additional carbon atom when compared to the basic polyketide skeleton.

A high throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, led to the discovery of a non-peptidic β-arrestin biased agonist for NTR1. The lead compound, 2-cyclopropyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- piperazin-1-yl)quinazoline, 32 (ML314), exhibits full agonist behavior against NTR1 (EC50 = 2.0 μM) in the primary assay and selectivity against NTR2. The effect of 32 is blocked by the NTR1 antagonist SR142948A in a dose dependent manner. Unlike peptide based NTR1 agonists, compound 32 has no significant response in a Ca(2+) mobilization assay and is thus a biased agonist that activates the β-arrestin pathway rather than the traditional G q coupled pathway. This bias has distinct biochemical and functional consequences that may lead to physiological advantages. Compound 32 displays good brain penetration in rodents, and studies examining its in vivo properties are underway.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2433825,20200629,53245590,174498737,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24611085,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Currently, there is no highly selective, nonpeptidyl and reversible mu opioid receptor antagonist available. Among a series of naltrexamine derivatives that have been designed and synthesized, two compounds, NAP and NAQ, were previously identified as novel leads for this purpose based on their in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profiles. Both compounds displayed high binding affinity and selectivity to the mu opioid receptor. To further study the interaction of these two ligands with the three opioid receptors, the recently released opioid receptor crystal structures were employed in docking studies to further test our original hypothesis that the ligands recognize a unique 'address' domain in the mu opioid receptor involving Trp318 that facilitates their selectivity. These modeling results were supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies on the mu opioid receptor, where the mutants Y210A and W318A confirmed the role of the latter in binding. Such work not only enriched the 'message-address' concept, also facilitated our next generation ligand design and development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2444608,20200630,25232540|25232541,103592905|103592906,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24055076,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

The first-generation ligands appeared to be MOR-selective, whereas the second and the third generation ones showed MOR/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) dual selectivity. Docking of ligands 2 (MOR selective) and 10 (MOR/KOR dual selective) to the three opioid receptor crystal structures revealed a nonconserved-residue-facilitated hydrogen-bonding network that could be responsible for their distinctive selectivity profiles. The MOR/KOR dual-selective ligand 10 showed no agonism and acted as a potent antagonist in the tail-flick assay.

An in vitro study in the rat._||_Abstract: We have previously found that phenanthrenic opioids, including codeine, modulate morphine glucuronidation in the rat. Here codeine and five of its derivatives were compared in their effects on the synthesis of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) from morphine by rat liver microsomal preparations, and by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes previously incubated for 72 h with either codeine or its derivatives. Acetylcodeine and pivaloylcodeine shared the capability of the parent compound of inhibiting the synthesis of M3G by liver microsomes through a noncompetitive mechanism of action. Their IC50 were 3.25, 2.27, and 4.32 μM, respectively. Dihydrocodeine, acetyldihydrocodeine, and lauroylcodeine were ineffective. In all the experimental circumstances M6G was undetectable in the incubation medium. In primary hepatocyte cultures codeine only inhibited M3G formation, but with a lower efficacy than that observed with microsomes (IC50 20.91 vs 4.32 μM). Preliminary results show that at micromolar concentrations codeine derivatives exhibit a low rate of affinity for μ opiate receptors. In conclusion, acetyl and pivaloyl derivatives of codeine noncompetitively inhibit liver glucuronidation of morphine interacting with microsomes. This study further strengths the notion that phenanthrenic opioids can modulate morphine glucuronidation independently from their effects on μ opiate receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3096279,20200620,5284543|5288826|5463874|5486550|70187032|72736864,103169185|123090163|194152077|194159045|194186555|194186556,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24183585,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

Recent studies demonstrated that compounds containing a biaryl-linked motif (Ar-X-Ar') modulate Na(+) currents. We, and others, have reported that compounds with an embedded benzyloxyphenyl unit (ArOCH2Ar', OCH2=X) exhibit potent anticonvulsant activities.

Electrophysiological studies of 4-(2'-trifluoromethoxybenzyloxy)benzylammonium chloride (9) using embryonic cortical neurons demonstrated that 9 promoted both fast and slow inactivation of Na(+) channels.

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor. Thus, the analog with a 17-(3-ethoxypropyl) group showed the best selectively and potent agonistic activity for the δ receptor among KNT-127 derivatives.

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285644,20200618,5748589|90678812|90678813,242640973|242640974|242640975,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

The additional N atom of the quinoxaline system located outside the ethylenediamine κ pharmacophore allows the fine-tuning of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. The perhydroquinoxalines were synthesized stereoselectively using the concept of late stage diversification of the central building blocks 14. In addition to high κ-opioid receptor affinity they demonstrate high selectivity over μ, δ, σ1, σ2, and NMDA receptors. In the [35S]GTPγS assay full agonism was observed. Because of their high polarity, the secondary amines 14a (log D7.4=0.26) and 14b (log D7.4=0.21) did not penetrate an artificial blood-brain barrier. 14b was able to inhibit the spontaneous pain reaction after rectal mustard oil application to mice (ED50=2.35 mg/kg).

Pharmacological activity and metabolic stability of the series was assessed. Consistent with earlier studies of β-amino acid substitution into endomorphins, multiple analogues incorporation AHPBA displayed high affinity for μ and δ opioid receptors (MOR and DOR, respectively) in radioligand competition binding assays, and an increased stability in rat brain membrane homogenates, notably Dmt-Tic-(2R,3S)AHPBA-Phe-NH2 (compound 26). Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of 26 produced antinociception (ED50 value (and 95% confidence interval) = 1.98 (0.79-4.15) nmol, i.c.v.) in the mouse 55 °C warm-water tail-withdrawal assay, equivalent to morphine (2.35 (1.13-5.03) nmol, i.c.v.), but demonstrated DOR-selective antagonism in addition to non-selective opioid agonism.

1261647,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu opioid receptor (unknown origin),"Title: Discovery of Novel Multifunctional Ligands with μ/δ Opioid Agonist/Neurokinin-1 (NK1) Antagonist Activities for the Treatment of Pain._||_Abstract: Multifunctional ligands with agonist bioactivities at μ/δ opioid receptors (MOR/DOR) and antagonist bioactivity at the neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R) have been designed and synthesized. These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

1272387,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to mu type opioid receptor (unknown origin) by competition binding assay,"Title: Receptor binding profiles and quantitative structure-affinity relationships of some 5-substituted-N,N-diallyltryptamines._||_Abstract: N,N-Diallyltryptamine (DALT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) are two tryptamines synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin. In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values. At the σ2 receptor, higher affinity was correlated with increasing π. These correlations should aid in the development of more potent and selective drugs within this family of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756495,20200623,24839550|50878551|127026052|127036186|127036932|127036953,174496429|336866908|336883200|336884944|336884983|336885079,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26739781,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Despite this, identification of a potent small molecule tool possessing pharmacokinetic properties allowing for robust in vivo target coverage has been challenging. Here we describe the optimization of a potent, selective series of quinazolinone-based TRPA1 antagonists. High-throughput screening identified 4, which possessed promising potency and selectivity. A strategy focused on optimizing potency while increasing polarity in order to improve intrinsic clearance culminated with the discovery of purinone 27 (AM-0902), which is a potent, selective antagonist of TRPA1 with pharmacokinetic properties allowing for >30-fold coverage of the rat TRPA1 IC50 in vivo. Compound 27 demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition of AITC-induced flinching in rats, validating its utility as a tool for interrogating the role of TRPA1 in in vivo pain models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3789626,20180905,73297271,336876664,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26942860,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

In vitro receptor binding studies revealed high σ1 receptor affinity (Ki σ1 = 1.4 nM) and excellent selectivity over not only σ2 receptor (1366-fold) but also other CNS targets (adrenergic, μ-opioid, sertonerigic receptors, etc.) for 2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-6-(3-(piperidin-1-yl)propoxy)pyridazin-3(2H)-one (compound 54). Compound 54 exhibited dose-dependent antiallodynic properties in mouse formalin model and rats chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. In addition, functional activity of compound 54 was evaluated using phenytoin and indicated that the compound was a σ1 receptor antagonist. Moreover, no motor impairments were found in rotarod tests at antiallodynic doses and no sedative side effect was evident in locomotor activity tests. Last but not least, good safety and favorable pharmacokinetic properties were also noted. These profiles suggest that compound 54 may be a member of a novel class of candidate drugs for treatment of neuropathic pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3806909,20200624,127050803,336904635,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27003636,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine. These hybrids hence represent a promising avenue toward analgesics for the dual treatment of acute and neuropathic pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3813313,20200624,49843739,242635779,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27035422,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

We herein report that potassium permanganate supported on iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate can be used as a convenient oxidant in the one-step, heterogeneous conversion of Δ7,8-opioids to the corresponding 7β-hydroxy-8-ketones. Details of the reaction mechanism are given and the effects of the substituent at position 6 of several opioids on the reaction outcome is discussed. The opioid hydroxy ketones prepared are antagonists at the mu- and delta-opioid receptors.

In order to study the effects of simplifying the structures of these compounds, a scaffold hopping strategy was used to design several novel sets of substituted isoindolines, tetrahydroisoquinolines and tetrahydro-2-benzazepines. The binding affinities of these new compounds for the sigma 1 (σ1R) and sigma 2 (σ2R) receptors were determined, and some analogs were identified that exhibit high affinity (Ki ≤ 25 nM) and significant selectivity (>10-fold) for σ1R or σ2R. The preferred binding modes of selected compounds for the σ1R are predicted by modeling studies, and the nature of substituents on the aromatic ring and the nitrogen atom of the bicyclic skeleton appears to affect the preferred binding orientation of σ1R-preferring ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4153438,20200618,132060720|132060733|132060734|132060743|132060746|132060752|132060763|132060770|132060776|132060812|132075278,404653221|404656024|404656499|404656632|404658729|404660063|404662671|404665338|404665926|404684558|404686633,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29656199,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Recently, many groups have sought MOR agonists that induce minimal βarrestin-mediated signaling because MOR agonist-treated βarrestin2 knockout mice were found to display enhanced antinociceptive effects with significantly less respiratory depression and tachyphylaxis. Substantial data now exists to support the premise that G protein signaling biased MOR agonists can be effective analgesic agents. We recently showed that, within a chemical series, the degree of bias correlates linearly with the magnitude of the respiratory safety index. Herein we describe the synthesis and optimization of piperidine benzimidazolone MOR agonists that together display a wide range of bias (G/βarr2).

According to the pharmacological results, the functional reversal observed in orvinol analogues by introduction of 7β-methyl substituent could not be reproduced in nepenthone analogues. Alternatively, introduction of 7β-methyl substituent was associated with substantial loss of both subtype selectivity and potency but not efficacy for nepenthone analogues, which was not found in 7β-methyl orvinol analogues. Surprisingly, SLL-603, a 7β-methyl analogue of SLL-020ACP, was identified to be a KOR full agonist. The possible molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity in activity cliff was also investigated. In conclusion, 7β-methyl substituent was a structural locus associated with activity cliff and demonstrated as a pharmacological heterogeneity between nepenthone and orvinol analogues that warrants further investigations.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4234963,20200619,118200491|118200640|134227139|145982510|145982515|145982585|145982792|145982828|145982968|145983526|145983969|145984022|145984192|145984332|145984702|145984984|145986165,404700896|404700902|404701000|404701302|404701354|404701555|404702330|404702946|404703021|404703256|404703400|404703467|404703987|404704355|404704805|404704854|404706051,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30054192,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or 99mTc for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) or the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEK cells transfected with μ (HEK-mu) or δ (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies.

In comparison with 1 and 2, the KOP receptor affinity, selectivity, and agonist activity were modulated by introducing bulkier N-substituents, a 2-fluoro substitution, and additional hydroxyl groups at positions 3' and 4'. Several analogues showed subnanomolar affinity and excellent KOP receptor selectivity acting as full or partial agonists, and one as an antagonist. The new diphenethylamines displayed antinociceptive efficacies with increased potencies than U50,488, 1 and 2 in the writhing assay and without inducing motor dysfunction after sc administration in mice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4019245,20200621,122589938|137631847|137632903|137634403|137638688|137640860|137642012|137643506|137646522|137646782|137647554|137649850|137651510|137654001|137655206|137655599|137656887|137660781|137660824|137662178,381837197|381838788|381841040|381847496|381850709|381850828|381852421|381854637|381859066|381859452|381860563|381863993|381866407|381870110|381871937|381872524|381878436|381885622|381885690|381887685,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28825813,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041179,20200621,72771081,242581035,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

While hit rates ranged from 40% to 63% against the on-targets, they were just as good against the antitargets, even though the molecules were selected for their putative lack of binding to the off-targets.

Thus, hLH-R represents a valid target for the treatment of sex hormone-dependent cancers and diseases (polycystic ovary syndrome, uterine fibroids, endometriosis) as well as contraception. Screening of the Bayer compound library led to the discovery of tetrahydrothienopyridine derivatives as novel, small-molecule (SMOL) hLH-R inhibitors and to the development of BAY-298, the first nanomolar hLH-R antagonist reducing sex hormone levels in vivo. Further optimization of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters led to the identification of BAY-899 with an improved in vitro profile and proven efficacy in vivo. BAY-298 and BAY-899 serve as valuable tool compounds to study hLH-R signaling in vitro and to interfere with the production of sex hormones in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4323864,20210302,139600336|139600337,440134679|440177903,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31670515,0,NULL,P35372,9606,198,,NULL

Since neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor antagonists reversed opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, the present work was performed to synthetize two branched peptidomimetics, EKR and RKE, containing the opioid peptide endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9. Our data obtained from the in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate experiment demonstrated that EKR functioned as a mixed mu-, delta-opioid receptors agonist and NPFF<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist/NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist, whereas RKE acted as a multi-functional peptidomimetic with the mu-opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism. Furthermore, EKR and RKE completely blocked the NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth of Neuro 2A cells. In vivo antinociception studies found that supraspinal administration of EKR and RKE dose-dependently produced potent antinociception via the mu-opioid receptor in the tail-flick test. In carrageenan inflammatory pain model, spinal administration of EKR and RKE induced dose-related analgesia, which was significantly reduced by the opioid antagonist naloxone and the NPFF antagonist RF9. Notably, compared with morphine, intracerebroventricular repeated administration of EKR and RKE maintained prolonged antinociceptive effectiveness. In addition, at the antinociceptive doses, these two branched peptidomimetics did not significantly inhibit gastrointestinal transit. Taken together, the present work suggest that EKR and RKE behave as multi-functional ligands with the opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism, and produce prolonged antinociception with limited side effects. Moreover, our results imply that EKR and RKE might be interesting pharmacological tools for further investigating the biological function of the NPFF and opioid systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4333170,20210302,5311081|155515973|155520785,103347472|440118014|440125450,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30626554,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

A set of spirocyclic cyclohexanes with diverse O-heterocycles and amino moieties (general structure III) was prepared and pharmacologically evaluated. In structure-activity relationships studies, the σ1 receptor affinity and σ1:σ2 selectivity were correlated with the stereochemistry, the kind and substitution pattern of the O-heterocycle, and the substituents at the exocyclic amino moiety. cis-configured 2-benzopyran cis-11b bearing a methoxy group and a tertiary cyclohexylmethylamino moiety showed the highest σ1 affinity ( Ki = 1.9 nM) of this series of compounds. In a Ca2+ influx assay, cis-11b behaved as a σ1 antagonist. cis-11b reveals high selectivity over σ2 and opioid receptors. The interactions of the novel σ1 ligands were analyzed on the molecular level using the recently reported X-ray crystal structure of the σ1 receptor protein. The protonated amino moiety forms a persistent salt bridge with E172. The spiro[benzopyran-1,1'-cyclohexane] scaffold and the cyclohexylmethyl moiety occupy two hydrophobic pockets.

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase catalytic activity of the tankyrases (TNKS/TNKS2) has been reported to reduce the Wnt/β-catenin signal by preventing poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent degradation of AXIN, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. With the goal of investigating the effects of tankyrase and Wnt pathway inhibition on tumor growth, we set out to find small-molecule inhibitors of TNKS/TNKS2 with suitable drug-like properties. Starting from 1a, a high-throughput screening hit, the spiroindoline derivative 40c (RK-287107) was discovered as a potent TNKS/TNKS2 inhibitor with >7000-fold selectivity against the PARP1 enzyme, which inhibits WNT-responsive TCF reporter activity and proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell line COLO-320DM.

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity. Molecular modeling suggests that ML417 interacts with the D3R in a unique manner, possibly explaining its remarkable selectivity. ML417 was also found to protect against neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs. Together with promising pharmacokinetics and toxicology profiles, these results suggest that ML417 is a novel and uniquely selective D3R agonist that may serve as both a research tool and a therapeutic lead for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4406684,20210302,119570|27842480|53475319,103245538|163332281|440152736,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32342685,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands.

Acyl-glycine inhibitors, however, are selective for GlyT2 and have been shown to provide analgesia in animal models of pain with minimal side effects, but are comparatively weak GlyT2 inhibitors. Here, we modify the simple acyl-glycine by synthesizing lipid analogues with a range of amino acid head groups in both l- and d-configurations, to produce nanomolar affinity, selective GlyT2 inhibitors. The potent inhibitor oleoyl-d-lysine (33) is also resistant to degradation in both human and rat plasma and liver microsomes, and is rapidly absorbed following an intraperitoneal injection to rats and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier. We demonstrate that 33 provides greater analgesia at lower doses, and does not possess the severe side effects of the very slowly reversible GlyT2 inhibitor, ORG25543 (2).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4481215,20210302,155547990,440175629,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30714733,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Increasingly bulky enantiomeric N-alkyl homologs were prepared until their interaction with the sigma 1 receptor decreased and their insolubility became a hindrance to their evaluation in vivo and/or in vitro. The (-)-methyl, -pentyl, -hexyl, and -heptyl homologs were essentially as potent as, or more potent than, morphine in the tail-flick, phenylquinone, and hot-plate assays for antinociceptive activity; the (-)-propyl homolog had narcotic antagonist activity between that of nalorphine and naloxone in the tail-flick vs morphine assay, and it also displayed antagonist properties in the single-dose suppression assay in the rhesus monkey. The antinociceptively potent (-)-heptyl homolog did not substitute for morphine in monkeys but did show morphine-like properties in a primary physical-dependence study in continuously infused rats. All five potent compounds showed high affinity for the mu opioid receptor from both rat and monkey preparations and the kappa opioid receptor (< 0.05 microM), and all except the (-)-methyl homolog interacted reasonably well at the delta receptor (K(i) < 0.1 microM). The (-)-propyl compound was equipotent (K(i) 1.5-2.0 nM) at mu and kappa receptors. The pattern of interaction of the (-)-enantiomeric homologs with mu receptors from rat and monkey preparations was similar, but not identical. The enantioselectivity of the homologs for mu receptors was greater in the rat than in the monkey preparation for all but the N-H and butyl compounds, and the enantioselectivity of the lower homologs (methyl through butyl) for the mu (monkey) receptor was greater than for the kappa or delta receptors. However, bulkier homologs (hexyl through decyl) displayed higher enantioselectivity at kappa or delta receptors than at the mu (monkey) receptor. The (+)-butyl through (+)-octyl homologs were essentially equipotent with, or more potent than, (+)-pentazocine at the sigma receptor.

The 8-amino group was hypothesized to be a replacement for the prototypic 8-OH substituent for 2,6-methano-3-benzazocines and related opiates. This OH group is generally required for binding yet is implicated in unfavorable pharmacokinetic characteristics such as low oral bioavailability and rapid clearance via O-glucuronidation. The core structures in which the 8-OH group was replaced were cyclazocine and its enantiomers, ethylketocyclazocine and its enantiomers, ketocyclazocine, and Mr2034. Many new analogues had high affinity for opioid receptors with several in the subnanomolar range. Highest affinity was seen in analogues with secondary 8-(hetero)arylamino appendages. Binding to opioid receptors was enantioselective with the (2R,6R,11R)-configuration preferred and high selectivity for mu and kappa over delta opioid receptors was observed within the series.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives.

The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series.

All but two of the eight compounds showed antagonist activity at 1 microM against [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin (DADLE) in the MVD when tested under reversible conditions; in all cases the Mel4 peptide had lower activity against DADLE than did the corresponding Phe4 peptide. At higher concentrations (10 microM) the two active Mel4 analogues, (benzyl)2Tyr-Gly-Gly-Mel-Leu (2a) and (allyl)2Tyr-Aib-Aib-Mel-Leu (3a), both showed weak irreversible antagonism at the delta receptor. Compound 2a was a selective irreversible delta opioid antagonist while 3a was an irreversible antagonist at both the mu and delta opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752479,20181011,13893363,103226438,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3041000,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752481,20200628,118718756,312365627,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244.

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755060,20200628,5360515|46877642,103734702|131283791,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

In a previous report we had described the unique biological characteristics of this ligand and also a need for further structural evaluation.(6) To pursue this, we have introduced a completely different heterocyclic template (2 and 3), which, based on molecular modeling studies, may present the required structural features to properly orient the pharmacophore groups. We also have made more subtle changes to the original piperazine scaffold (5 and 11). The biological activities of these compounds revealed an important participation of the scaffold in the ligand-receptor interaction. To further explore functional diversity on the scaffold, we have maintained the original piperazine ring and introduced four different functionalities at position 2 of the heterocyclic ring (15a-d; a = CH(2)-O-CH(2)-Ph; b = Me; c = CH(2)Ph; d = CH(2)OH). The biological activities observed for these compounds showed a very interesting trend in terms of the steric effects of the groups introduced at this position. A decrease of almost 2000-fold in affinity and potency at the delta-receptor was observed for 15c compared with 15b. This difference may be explained if we postulate that the bioactive conformation of these peptidomimetics is close to the minimal energy conformations calculated in our study. On the basis of these findings we have realized the importance of this position to further explore and simplify the structure of future generations of peptidomimetic ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755555,20181016,10342555|10791647,103396326|103396354,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10639279,0,NULL,P35372,9823,NULL,,NULL

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding.

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding.

150240,Confirmatory,Opioid receptor agonistic potency in guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle(GPI) preparation,"Title: Opioid agonist and antagonist activities of peripherally selective derivatives of naltrexamine and oxymorphamine._||_Abstract: A series of beta-naltrexamine and beta-oxymorphamine derivatives that contain ionizable moieties coupled to the 6 beta-amino group were synthesized in an effort to develop antagonists and agonists that have negligible access into the central nervous system (CNS). Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

A cross-species study on the metabolism of (R)-3 in vitro has shown large variations in the extent of metabolism from species to species. Imidazoquinolinones (R)-5 and (R)-6 have comparable activity to (R)-3 in animals and also show good dopaminergic (D2) and serotonergic (5HT1A) activities in binding assays.

Isopavines as a new class of morphinomimetics and their human opioid receptor binding activity._||_Abstract: The importance of visual imagery and relational thinking manifests itself in a heuristic approach to the design and synthesis of potential morphinomimetics as agonists of the human mu receptor. The well-known class of alkaloids represented by the isopavine nucleus has a topological resemblance to the morphine skeleton, especially when viewed in a particular way. Enantiopure isopavines can be readily obtained from a 1,2 Stevens rearrangement of 13-substituted dihydromethanodibenzoazocines, prepared in four steps from d- and l-amino acids. Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity.

Novel 4-alkoxy and 14-phenylpropoxy derivatives of the mu opioid receptor antagonist cyprodime._||_Abstract: The synthesis, biological, and pharmacological evaluation of novel derivatives of cyprodime are described. Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

Thus Michael reaction of the benzylimines of oxycodones and oxymorphones with nitrostyrenes gave a series of 4'-aryl-N-benzylpyrrolomorphinans. These were selective delta antagonists of much higher in vitro potency (with 5a having K(e) delta = <1 nM) than their binding affinities predicted. In mice in vivo assays 5a showed good delta antagonist activity in the anti-writhing analgesic assay and also inhibited delta agonist-induced convulsant activity.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757365,20200703,44367028,103397107,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11784158,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL
151124,Confirmatory,Binding affinity using [3H]diprenorphine as the radioligand against wild-type Opioid receptor mu 1 in COS-7 cells,"Title: Binding of norbinaltorphimine (norBNI) congeners to wild-type and mutant mu and kappa opioid receptors: molecular recognition loci for the pharmacophore and address components of kappa antagonists._||_Abstract: Molecular modifications of both the kappa opioid antagonist norbinaltorphimine (norBNI, 1) and the kappa receptor have provided evidence that the selectivity of this ligand is conferred through ionic interaction if its N17' protonated amine group (an 'address') with a nonconserved acidic residue (Glu297) on the kappa receptor. In the present study, we have examined the effect of structural modifications on the affinity of norBNI analogues for wild-type and mutant kappa and mu opioid receptors expressed in COS-7 cells. Compounds 2, 3, and 7, which have an antagonist pharmacophore and basic N17' group in common with norBNI, retained high affinity for the wild-type kappa but exhibited greatly reduced affinity for mutant kappa receptors (E297K and E297A). Modification of the phenolic or N-substituent groups of the antagonist pharmacophore (4 and 5) or removal of basicity at the address N17' center (6) led to greatly reduced affinity for the wild-type and mutant receptors. The reduced affinity upon modification of the kappa receptor is consistent with the ionic interaction of the protonated N17' group of kappa antagonists (1-3, 7) with the carboxylate group of E297 at the top of TM6. This was supported by the greatly enhanced affinity of compounds 1-3 for the mutant mu receptor (K303E), as compared to the wild-type mu receptor, given that residue K303 occupies a position equivalent to that of E297 in the kappa receptor. In view of the high degree of homology of the seven TM domains of the kappa and mu opioid receptors, it is suggested that the antagonist pharmacophore is bound within this highly conserved region of the kappa or mutant mu receptor and that an anionic residue at the top of TM6 (E297 or K303E, respectively) provides additional binding affinity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757366,20181017,443408|5480230|10372345|10461299|10484384|10508302|13787553,103189159|103211596|103698780|103734667|103734668|103734675|103735456,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10780914,0,NULL,P35372,9527,207,,NULL
151594,Confirmatory,Affinity towards human Opioid receptor mu 1 on CHO cell membranes using [3H]DAMGO displacement.,"Title: Extended TIP(P) analogues as precursors for labeled delta-opioid receptor ligands._||_Abstract: Tyr-Tic-Phe-Phe-OH (TIPP) and the shorter Tyr-Tic-Phe-OH (TIP) peptides are potent and highly selective antagonists at the delta-opioid receptor and, therefore, are ideal candidates for the attachment of labels to assist in the study of delta-opioid receptors. Peptides extended at the C-terminus with residues which can be used as handles for further modification and/or labeling (i.e. Asx, Glx, and Lys) were synthesized. The TIPP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives exhibited similar delta-receptor affinity to TIPP (K(i) = 5-10 nM vs K(i) = 6 nM), and neither the location of the carboxylic acid moiety nor the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue significantly affected the delta-receptor affinity of these derivatives. Extension of TIPP with an additional residue did not increase mu-receptor affinity, even though the position of the acidic group, which imparts delta-receptor selectivity to TIPP, was shifted relative to the carboxylic acid moiety of TIPP. The delta-receptor affinities of the TIP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives were found to be influenced mainly by the position of the carboxylic acid function rather than the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue. TIP(P)-D/L-Lys(Ac)-OH derivatives exhibited moderate delta-receptor affinity (K(i)(delta) = 16-28 nM). The most potent compounds found in the extended TIP(P) series were TIPP-D-Gln-OH and TIP-D-Gln-OH (K(i)(delta) = 5 nM) which had similar affinities to TIPP.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL873069,20181016,644210|10077545|10440134|10557001|10651237|10651238|10651452|10675111|10676537|10722490|10747714|10771425|10818843|10818935|10841295|10841482|11803174|12093958|73350137|73354619|118719100,103463433|174485071|174495129|174500373|174500374|174500375|174500376|174500377|174500378|174505473|174510682|174510684|174510685|174515846|174515847|174515848|174520934|174520935|174520936|174520937|312366212,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11150177,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,197,,NULL

The use of these neuroactive peptides in diverse studies has led to an increased understanding of brain function. Unfortunately, the use of brain-derived peptides as pharmaceutical agents to alter brain chemistry in vivo has lagged because peptides do not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Attachment of simple sugars to enkephalins increases their penetration of the blood-brain barrier and allows the resulting glycopeptide analogues to function effectively as drugs. The delta-selective glycosylated Leu-enkephalin amide 2, H(2)N-Tyr-D-Thr-Gly-Phe-Leu-Ser(beta-D-Glc)-CONH(2), produces analgesic effects similar to morphine, even when administered peripherally, yet possesses reduced dependence liability as indicated by naloxone-precipitated withdrawal studies.

Approaches to eliminate opioid agonist metabolites via modification of linker and 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine moiety._||_Abstract: We have previously described compound 1a as a high-affinity subtype selective alpha(1a) antagonist. In vitro and in vivo evaluation of compound 1a showed its major metabolite to be a mu-opioid agonist, 4-methoxycarbonyl-4-phenylpiperidine (3). Several dihydropyrimidinone analogues were synthesized with the goal of either minimizing the formation of 3 by modification of the linker or finding alternative piperidine moieties which when cleaved as a consequence of metabolism would not give rise to mu-opioid activity. Modification of the linker gave several compounds with good alpha(1a) binding affinity (K(i) = < 1 nM) and selectivity (>300-fold over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d)). In vitro analysis in the microsomal assay revealed these modifications did not significantly affect N-dealkylation and the formation of the piperidine 3. The second approach, however, yielded several piperidine replacements for 3, which did not show significant mu-opioid activity. Several of these compounds maintained good affinity at the alpha(1a) adrenoceptor and selectivity over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d). For example, the piperidine fragments of (+)-73 and (+)-83, viz. 4-cyano-4-phenylpiperidine and 4-methyl-4-phenylpiperidine, were essentially inactive at the mu-opioid receptor (IC(50) > 30 microM vs 3 microM for 3). Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 were subjected to detailed in vitro and in vivo characterization. Both these compounds, in addition to their excellent selectivity (>880-fold) over alpha(1b) and alpha(1d), also showed good selectivity over several other recombinant human G-protein coupled receptors. Compounds (+)-73 and (+)-83 showed good functional potency in isolated human prostate tissues, with K(b)s comparable to their in vitro alpha(1a) binding data. In addition, compound (+)-73 also exhibited good uroselectivity (DBP K(b)/IUP K(b) > 20-fold) in the in vivo experiments in dogs, similar to 1a.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL874639,20181016,32414|2823239|10589837|10754185,103287849|103385516|103386220|103386287,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10579841,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A change in chirality of Dmt at C alpha (1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 13) curtailed delta receptor parameters, while replacement of its alpha-amino function by a methyl group (3) led to inactivity; Tyr-Tic analogues 4 and 11 weakly interacted with delta receptors. N-Alkylation of H-Dmt-Tic-OH and H-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH with methyl groups produced potent delta-opioid ligands with high delta receptor binding capabilities and enhanced delta antagonism: (i) N-Me-Dmt-Tic-OH 5 had high delta opioid binding (Ki delta = 0.2 nM), elevated delta antagonism on mouse vas deferens (MVD) (pA2 = 8.5; Ke = 2.8 nM), and nondetectable mu activity with guinea pig ileum (GPI). (ii) N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) was equally efficacious in delta receptor binding (Ki delta = 0.12 nM; Ki mu/Ki delta = 20000), but delta antagonism rose considerably (pA2 = 9.4; Ke = 0.28 nM) with weak mu antagonism (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:5640). N-Me-(9) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) also augmented delta opioid receptor binding, such that 15 demonstrated high affinity (Ki delta = 0.0755 nM) and selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 20132) with exceptional antagonist activity on MVD (pA2 = 9.6; Ke = 0.22 nM) and weak antagonism on GPI (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:7180).

For many years efforts to obtain superior GABAB agonists were unsuccessful. We describe the syntheses and biological properties of two new series of GABAB agonists, the best compounds of which are more potent than baclofen in vitro and in vivo. They were obtained by replacing the carboxylic acid group of GABA or baclofen derivatives with either the phosphinic acid or the methylphosphinic acid residue. Surprisingly, ethyl- and higher alkylphosphinic acid derivatives of GABA yielded novel GABAB antagonists, which are described in part 2 of this series. Structure-activity relationships of the novel GABAB agonists are discussed with respect to their affinities to GABAB receptors as well as to their effects in many functional tests in vitro and in vivo providing new muscle relaxant drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756442,20181014,5230|5310933,103334318|103334994,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650684,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and biological evaluation of piperazinopyrrolothienopyrazines._||_Abstract: A series of piperazinopyrrolo[1,2-a]thieno[3,2-e]- and -[2,3-e]pyrazine derivatives were prepared and evaluated in order to determine the necessary requirements for high affinity on the 5-HT3 receptors and high selectivity versus other 5-HT receptor subtypes. Various substitutions on the piperazine and the thiophene ring of the pyrrolothienopyrazine moieties were systematically explored as well as replacement of the piperazine by other cyclic amines. The best compounds are in the nanomolar range of affinity of 5-HT3 receptors with high to very high selectivity (up to 10,000 for 14b). These high-affinity compounds have in common a benzyl- or allylpiperazine substituent with no substitutions on the thiophene ring. Five of these compounds (1a, 4b, 13a,b, and 14b) have been evaluated on the Von Bezold-Jarisch reflex and were characterized as partial agonists. One of them, 13a, has shown in vivo at very low dose a potent anxiolytic-like activity in the light/dark test.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756443,20181015,9863146,103237550,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8642566,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Since 5b and 5c have the 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl) group locked in a conformation comparable to an equatorial group of a piperidine chair conformation, this information provides very strong evidence that opioid antagonists can interact with opioid receptors in this conformation. In addition, it suggests that the trans-3, 4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of antagonist operates via a phenyl equatorial piperidine chair conformation. Importantly, the close relationship between the 4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidines and 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan antagonists shows that the latter class of compound provides a rigid platform on which to build a novel series of opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758205,20181016,5360515,131283791,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9767649,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives._||_Abstract: This paper describes the chemical synthesis and the development of structure-activity relationships (SAR) for the kappa opioid receptor affinity and mu/kappa opioid receptor selectivity of novel N-[(2-aminocyclohexyl)aryl]acetamide derivatives. The SAR of this series are investigated by consideration of structural modifications made to the aromatic moiety, the amide linkage, and cyclohexane and the pyrrolidine ring substituents of the prototype kappa selective agonist, PD117302 (trans-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo[b]thiophene-4- acetamide) (1). The kappa and mu opioid receptor binding affinities of 23 novel compounds are reported. It is observed that optimal mu/kappa receptor selectivity is obtained with a benzo[b]thiophene aromatic system attached via the C-4 position, which is discussed in terms of steric and electronic parameters. The amide linkage has been replaced with the reversed amide, an ester, an aminomethylene, a thioamide, and a secondary amide. The best of these isosteres is the N-methyl amide. Substitution of the pyrrolidine ring of PD117302 in the 3-position with a hydroxymethylene group increases the mu/kappa selectivity compared to the unsubstituted compound, e.g. compound 14, trans-(+/-)-N-methyl-N-[2-[3-(hydroxymethyl)-1-pyrrolidinyl] cyclohexyl]-4-benzo[b]furanacetamide monohydrochloride, mu/kappa receptor selectivity = 244.

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor. The lack of correlation between the pharmacological profiles observed in smooth muscle and in the brain binding assays suggests the existence of different subtypes of the kappa and mu opioid receptors in the brain and peripheral nervous systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756021,20181012,10102939|10677974|15160017|16133805|25079852|25087514|25087515|25087516,103173862|103241413|103241617|103241618|103241619|103241662|103241663|103241664,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1972964,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv. The present study suggests that zwitterionic groups are highly effective in preventing penetration of ligands into the CNS.

Moreover, they could find clinical applications when the central actions are unwanted.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872830,20181012,13893991|13894004|13894014,163312515|163319331|163333212,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2475628,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

These ligands were of interest in our investigation of the relationship between the structure of the ester function and the ability to irreversibly block mu opioid receptors. While all of the ligands were potent reversible agonists in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, most appeared to behave as irreversible antagonists of morphine. The benzyl 5 and phenethyl 6 esters possessed irreversible mu antagonist potency that was of similar magnitude to that of beta-FNA in the GPI. In the MVD, all esters appeared to irreversibly block the agonist effect of morphine, but none of the compounds irreversibly antagonized [D-Ala2,D-Leu5]enkephalin to a significant degree.

Substitutions in position 3._||_Abstract: cyclo[d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-13)NH(2) (Dap, 2,3-diaminopropionic acid; Dyn A, dynorphin A), synthesized previously in our laboratory, showed sub-nanomolar affinity for kappa opioid receptors and potent agonist activity in the guinea pig ileum assay (Arttamangkul et al., J. Med. Chem. 1995, 38, 2410-2417). Various modifications were made in position 3 of cyclo[d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) that could influence the opioid receptor affinity, selectivity, and/or efficacy of this peptide. An optimized orthogonal synthetic strategy was developed for the synthesis of these cyclic peptides in which the final peptides could be cleaved from the solid support with trifluoroacetic acid. Substitutions of Gly(3) by Ala, d-Ala, Trp, and d-Trp in cyclo[d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) and its linear counterpart [d-Asp(2),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) were generally well tolerated by both kappa and micro opioid receptors. Despite differences in the size and stereochemistry of the substitutions, most of the peptides (except for cyclo[d-Asp(2),Pro(3),Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2) and [d-Asp(2),d-Ala(3), Dap(5)]Dyn A-(1-11)NH(2)) exhibited low nanomolar affinity for both kappa (K(i) = 0.21 to 2.2 nM) and micro (K(i) = 0.22 to 7.27 nM) opioid receptors.

N,N-Dialkylated and N-monoalkylated (alkyl = allyl, benzyl, and cyclopropylmethyl (CPM) tyrosine derivatives were prepared from tyrosine tert-butyl ester and the corresponding alkyl halides. [D-Pro10]Dyn A-(2-11) was prepared by solid phase synthesis using Fmoc-protected amino acids, and the tyrosine derivatives were coupled to the peptide with BOP ((benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate). Both the degree of substitution and the identity of the alkyl group affected kappa-receptor affinity, selectivity, and efficacy. All of the N-monoalkylated derivatives exhibited much higher affinity (Ki < 0.05 nM) for kappa receptors in the guinea pig cerebellum and greatly enhanced kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu) > 200) compared to the N,N-dialkyl [D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11) analogues, although one disubstituted analogue, N,N-diCPM[D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11), retained high affinity (Ki = 0.19 nM) for kappa receptors. Thus the introduction of the second alkyl group at the N-terminus lowered kappa-receptor affinity and selectivity. The N-allyl and N-CPM analogues were moderately potent agonists in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) assay, while the N-benzyl derivative was a weak agonist in this assay. In vivo in the phenylquinone abdominal stretching assay the N-CPM analogue exhibited potent antinociceptive activity (ED50 = 1.1 micrograms/mouse), while N-allyl[D-Pro10]Dyn A-(1-11) exhibited weak antinociceptive activity (ED50 = 27 micrograms/mouse).

Evidence for the existence of different mu receptor subtypes in different tissues._||_Abstract: A series of beta-funaltrexamine (2, beta-FNA) analogues (3-14) were synthesized that contain a variety of electrophilic groups attached at the 6 beta-position of the opiate. The opioid agonist and antagonist activities of these ligands were evaluated in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) in vitro assays. Several of the compounds behaved like beta-FNA in that they exhibited reversible agonist activity at kappa opioid receptors and irreversible antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. The rank order of irreversible antagonism for a series of related Michael acceptors did not parallel their intrinsic chemical reactivity, confirming that the degree of covalent binding is in part dependent on the spatial disposition of the electrophilic center relative to the receptor nucleophile (secondary recognition). The maleimidoacetamide 8 behaved very differently from beta-FNA in that it exhibited considerably greater irreversible mu antagonism in MVD relative to the mu blockage in the GPI. This suggests that different proportions of mu receptor subtypes exist in the two tissues. Several of the agents tested, including some nonreactive control compounds, displayed an unusual type of persistent kappa agonist activity in the GPI. This activity, which was reversed by addition of naloxone, reappeared upon washing. Receptor models have been presented to explain this effect. A few of the reactive ligands displayed a true nonreversible kappa agonist activity, suggesting a covalent association with the receptor. Of note in this regard was the propiolamide 6, which appeared to be an irreversible mixed agonist-antagonist at kappa and mu receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850207,20200628,44276305,103196829,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6090663,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively).

The initially reported tryptamine analogues displayed either poor solution stability, potent central nervous system activity, or both of these undesirable characteristics and were unacceptable for clinical evaluation. A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect. Compound 9 appears to be an excellent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist for conducting further studies directed toward a clinical proof-of-concept study for this class of ocular hypotensive agents.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL853009,20181020,135453290,103476625,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16392816,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and in vivo evaluation of [O-methyl-(11)C]2-{4-[4-(7-methoxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (10), a potential high affinity (K(i) = 1.36 nM) 5-HT(1A) agonist PET tracer is described. Piperazine 10 is a 5-HT(1A) agonist with an EC(50) comparable to serotonin, based on cAMP formation and GTP(gamma)S binding assays. Radiosynthesis of [(11)C]10 has been achieved by reacting 2-{4-[4-(7-hydroxynaphthalen-1-yl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}-4-methyl-2H-[1,2,4]triazine-3,5-dione (9) and [(11)C]CH(3)OTf in 25 +/- 5% (n = 15) yield at the end of synthesis (EOS). The chemical and radiochemical purities of [(11)C]10 were >99% with a specific activity 1500 +/- 300 Ci/mmol (n =15). PET studies in anesthetized baboon demonstrate [(11)C]10 specific binding in brain regions rich in 5-HT(1A) receptors. Binding of [(11)C]10 was blocked by WAY100635 and 8-OH-DPAT. The regional brain volumes of distribution (V(T)) of [(11)C]10 in baboon correlate with [(11)C]WAY100635 V(T) in baboons.

The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3. The constrained analogues 6 and 9 showed high affinity toward the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6 was found to be a mu-opioid antagonist, whereas the constrained analogue 9 displayed potent mu-agonist activity in vitro. This study provides additional information about the molecular determinants for mu recognition, the structural features affecting ligand binding, and the structure function relationships.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL909318,20181021,16094343,103503700,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17149858,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain. These data demonstrate that acute and selective pharmacological blockade of Na(v)1.8 sodium channels in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL935652,20181023,16038374,103558202,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17483457,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1017471,20181024,5284596,103170037,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

As a hydrolase, LTA 4H stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of the unstable epoxide LTA 4 to the diol LTB 4, a potent chemoattractant and activator of neutrophils and a chemoattractant of eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells. Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening. From this work we identified a series of benzoxazole, benzthiazole, and benzimidazole inhibitors.

The series similarity to previously reported sigma ligands prompted analysis at sigma receptors to determine the SAR for affinity at sigma receptors. Within the N-substituent series the saturated analogs showed increased affinity at both sigma receptors. Optimal chain length in the N-arylalkyl series for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors proved to be N-propylphenyl; extension to a four carbon chain dramatically decreased affinity at both receptors. Substituents in the 4-position affect only sigma(1) affinity; no change in affinity at sigma(2) was shown. The N-isobutyl, N-phenylpropyl, and N-benzyl analogs are worth pursuing due to their good affinity and selectivity at the sigma(1) receptor, whereas the N-benzyl analog exhibits the greatest selectivity for sigma(1).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL995853,20181026,62513|191408|13046858|13599612|18997149|24885962|24885965|24886211|24886213,103628005|103628006|103628007|103628060|103628061|103628062|103628063|103628064|103628065,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17988766,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL
350956,Literature-derived,Inhibition of mu opioid receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed.

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970720,20181026,5462471,103217856,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

Eleven [d-Xaa(5)]NPS derivatives were synthesized and pharmacologically tested measuring [Ca(2+)](i) in HEK293(mNPSR) cells.

At present, there is little information available as to why this compound is selective for kappa opioid receptors. One approach to better understanding the mode of binding of 1 at kappa receptors is to systematically alter the structure of 1 and examine the effects on opioid receptor affinity and activity. Currently, there is a paucity of methods described for the preparation of analogues derived from 1. Here, we report the investigation of several chemical transformations of 1 isolated from S. divinorum. In particular, this work provides a semisynthesis of salvinicins A (2) and B (3) and has identified 10a as the first neoclerodane diterpene with delta opioid antagonist activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL969927,20181025,128563|11546512,103457931|103497749,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16441078,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL
381434,Literature-derived,Effect on mu opioid dependent JNK phosphorylation in U50488 treated HEK293 cells expressing GFP tagged mu opioid receptor at 10 uM after 1 hr,"Title: Long-acting kappa opioid antagonists disrupt receptor signaling and produce noncompetitive effects by activating c-Jun N-terminal kinase._||_Abstract: Norbinaltorphimine (NorBNI), guanidinonaltrindole, and atrans-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl) piperidine (JDTic) are selective kappa opioid receptor (KOR) antagonists having very long durations of action in vivo despite binding non-covalently in vitro and having only moderately high affinities. Consistent with this, we found that antagonist treatment significantly reduced the subsequent analgesic response of mice to the KOR agonist U50,488 in the tail-withdrawal assay for 14-21 days. Receptor protection assays were designed to distinguish between possible explanations for this anomalous effect, and we found that mice pretreated with the readily reversible opioid antagonists naloxone or buprenorphine before norBNI responded strongly in the tail-flick analgesia assay to a subsequent challenge with U50,488 1 week later. Protection by a rapidly cleared reagent indicates that norBNI did not persist at the site of action. In vitro binding of [(3)H]U69,593 to KOR showed that K(d) and Bmax values were not significantly affected by prior in vivo norBNI exposure, indicating that the agonist binding site was intact. Consistent with the concept that the long-lasting effects might be caused by a functional disruption of KOR signaling, both norBNI and JDTic were found to stimulate c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation in HEK293 cells expressing KOR-GFP but not in untransfected cells. Similarly, norBNI increased phospho-JNK in both the striatum and spinal cord in wild type mice but not in KOR knock-out mice. Pretreatment of mice with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 before norBNI attenuated the long acting antagonism. Together, these results suggest that the long duration KOR antagonists disrupt KOR signaling by activating JNK.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL977786,20181025,5480230,103698780,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17702750,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

Their predominant opioid receptor activity was mu receptor (MOR) antagonism, but the unsubstituted cinnamoyl derivative (6a) had partial MOR agonist activity in vitro and in vivo. When compared to the equivalent 14-cinnamoylaminomorphinones (5), the cinnamoyloxy morphinones (6) as MOR antagonists had a shorter duration of action and were less effective as pseudoirreversible antagonists. The antinociceptive activity of the cinnamoyloxycodeinones (7) was not significantly greater than that of the morphinones (6), but they exhibited no evidence of any pseudoirreversible MOR antagonism. In both respects, these profiles differed from those of the equivalent 14-cinnamoylaminocodeinones (4).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1023001,20180910,5288826|25257431|44417373,103169185|103500772|103594951,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19253983,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

In order to investigate structural requirements for position 2, we synthesized endomorphin analogs incorporating, instead of Pro, unnatural amino acids with six-membered heterocyclic rings, such as piperidine 2-, 3- or 4-carboxylic acids (Pip, Nip and Inp, respectively). (R)-Nip residue turned out to be favourable for improving MOR affinity. Introduction of 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) instead of Tyr(1) led to obtaining [Dmt(1), (R)-Nip(2)]EM-2 which showed exceptional MOR affinity and high stability against enzymatic degradation in rat brain homogenate. In in vivo hot-plate test in mice, this analog given intracerebroventicularly (i.c.v.), produced profound supraspinal analgesia, being much more potent than EM-2. The antinociceptive effect of this analog lasted about 170 min and was almost completely reversed by beta-funaltrexamine (beta-FNA), a selective MOR antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1036852,20180910,5311081|24863351|44592575,103347472|103654109|103654111,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19435668,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

We conducted bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) studies on COS cells coexpressing MOP and CCK2 receptors to determine whether receptor heterodimerization is involved in such modulation. These studies revealed the absence of constitutive or monovalent ligand-induced heterodimerization. Heterodimerization of MOP and CCK2 receptors therefore is unlikely to be responsible for the opposing effects between morphine and CCK in the CNS. However, association was induced, as indicated by a positive BRET signal, on exposure of the cells to bivalent ligands containing mu-opioid agonist and CCK2 receptor antagonist pharmacophores linked through spacers containing 16-22 atoms but not with a shorter (9-atom) spacer. These studies demonstrate for the first time that an appropriately designed bivalent ligand is capable of inducing association of G-protein-coupled receptors. The finding that opioid tolerance studies with these ligands in mice showed no correlation with the BRET data is consistent with the absence of association of MOP and CCK2 receptors in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1021530,20181026,5462471|44580898|44580899|44580900|44580901|44580932,103217856|103628240|103628241|103628242|103628243|103628328,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,19113864,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,197,,NULL

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR.

In receptor binding studies, the N-benzyl derivative 7a (WMS-1813) revealed extraordinarily high sigma(1) receptor affinity (K(i) = 1.4 nM) and excellent sigma(1)/sigma(2) selectivity (>600 fold). In vitro biotransformation of 7a with rat liver microsomes led to three main metabolites. N-Debenzylation was inhibited by introduction of an N-phenylethyl residue (7 g). The PET tracer [(18)F]7a was synthesized by nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 13 with K[(18)F]F-K222-carbonate complex. The decay corrected radiochemical yield of [(18)F]7a was 35-48% with a radiochemical purity of >99.5% and a specific activity of 150-238 GBq/micromol. The radiotracer properties were evaluated in female CD-1 mice by organ distribution and ex vivo brain autoradiography. The radiotracer uptake in the brain was fast and sufficient, with values of approximately 4% injected dose per gram.

Historically, many of these drugs have multiple mechanisms of action including calcium and sodium channel blockade as well as GABAergic activity and thus a number of associated side effects. Modulation of the M-current through opening of KCNQ channels has been proposed as a way to attenuate neuroexcitability and have a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of seizure disorders. Therefore, as part of our program to identify new treatments for epilepsy, we set out to identify agonists of KCNQ channels.

Here we describe the isolation and pharmacological characterization of four novel, neurologically active purines 1-4, isolated from Haplosclerida sponges collected in the Republic of Palau. The structures were determined by analyses of spectral and X-ray data. Compound 1 induced convulsions upon intracerebroventricular injection into mice, with a CD50 value of 2.4 nmol/mouse. Purines 2-4 were active in mouse bioassays at higher doses. The seizurogenic activity of 1 was correlated with inhibition of neuronal GABAergic transmission, with only a modest impact on excitatory signaling, in electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal neurons. Despite having a purine template structure, the inhibitory activity of 1 was not prevented by a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist. Thus, 1 represents a novel substituted purine that elicits convulsions through its actions on inhibitory neurotransmission.

In this work, an aromatic ring and/or alkyl residues have been used with an N-propanamide or N-acetamide spacer for the synthesis of a new series of 5,9-dimethyl-2'-hydroxy-6,7-benzomorphan derivatives (12-22).

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640636,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,NULL,P35372,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Unusual inverse μ-agonists and potent μ-opioid antagonists by modification of the N-substituent in enantiomeric 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphans._||_Abstract: Conformational restraint in the N-substituent of enantiomeric 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphans was conferred by the addition of a cyclopropane ring or a double bond. All of the possible enantiomers and isomers of the N-substituted compounds were synthesized. Opioid receptor binding assays indicated that some of them had about 20-fold higher μ-affinity than the compound with an N-phenylpropyl substituent (K(i) = 2-450 nM for the examined compounds with various N-substituents). Most of the compounds acted unusually as inverse agonists in the [(35)S]GTP-γ-S functional binding assay using nondependent cells that stably express the cloned human μ-opioid receptor. Two of the N-substituted compounds with a cyclopropane ring were very potent μ-opioid antagonists ((+)-29, K(e) = 0.17 and (-)-30, K(e) =0.3) in the [(35)S]GTP-γ-S functional binding assay.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor. In conclusion the present study set the basis for a systematic investigation on the structural modifications that can be introduced into novel ligands for NOPr and helped to feature the surrounds of the allosteric site of NOPr.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1764074,20200629,5311340|52915030|52915031|52915032|52915269|52915270|52915389|52915390|52915391|52915392|52915393|52915514|52915515|52915516|52915517|52915518|52915634|52915635|52915636|52915637|52916598|52916599|52916712|52916713|52916714,103383609|131271836|131271837|131271839|131271840|131271841|131277784|131277785|131277786|131277788|131277789|131279873|131279874|131279875|131279876|131281858|131281861|131281862|131281863|131281864|131283862|131283863|131283864|131285840|131287148,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21330016,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

Microwave-assisted methods were developed and successfully employed, aiding in functionalizing the chemically sensitive salvinorin A scaffold. This demonstrates the first reported results for both cycloaddition of the furan ring and functionalization via microwave-assisted methodology of the salvinorin A skeleton. The cycloadducts yielded herein introduce electron-withdrawing substituents and bulky aromatic groups into the C-12 position. Kappa opioid (KOP) receptor space was explored through aromatization of the bent oxanorbornadiene system possessed by the cycloadducts to a planar phenyl ring system. Although dimethyl- and diethylcarboxylate analogues 5 and 6 retain some affinity and selectivity for KOP receptors and are full agonists, their aromatized counterparts 13 and 14 have reduced affinity for KOP receptors.

A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM).

The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity.

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects.

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP). Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1. Collectively, these findings suggest that different aromatic groups appended directly to the decalin core may be well tolerated by KOP receptors, and may generate further ligands with affinity and activity at KOP receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026566,20180921,25242485|44581834|70681352|70683422|70683437|70685545|70687673|70687674|70693930,103630048|103630212|160667387|160672672|160672710|160678019|160683345|160683346|160699551,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22464684,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

However, their central administration led to the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Conjugation of C-terminal substance P (SP) fragments to opioids and opioid peptides was previously shown to produce hybrid peptides with strong analgesic activity, with low or no propensity to develop tolerance. In this study, four peptides (2-5) comprised of endomorphin-1 (1) and C-terminal fragments of SP (four or five amino acids, SP(8-11) (2) or SP(7-11) (4), respectively), with an overlapping Phe residue, were synthesized. To overcome low metabolic stability and poor membrane permeability of the peptide, the N-terminus of 2 and 4 was further modified with a C10-carbon lipoamino acid (C10LAA) achieving 3 and 5, respectively. LAA-modification of the hybrid peptides resulted in a significant increase in metabolic stability and membrane permeability compared to peptides 1, 2 and 4. Compound 5 showed potent μ-opioid receptor binding affinity (K(iμ)=3.87 ± 0.51 nM) with dose-dependent agonist activity in the nanomolar range (IC(50)=45 ± 13 nM).

These effects are particularly remarkable because (1) salvinorin A is the first reported non-nitrogenous opioid receptor agonist and (2) its effects are not mediated through the previously investigated targets of psychotomimetics.

A library of compounds using the core scaffold 21 was synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit [(35)S]GTPγS binding stimulated by the selective κ opioid agonist U69,593. These studies led to N-[(1S)-1-{[(3S)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methylpiperazin-1-yl]methyl}-2-methylpropyl]-4-phenoxybenzamide (11a), a compound that showed good κ opioid receptor antagonist properties. An SAR study based on 11a provided 28 novel analogues.

As a first step in investigating this possibility, we have synthesized a series of bivalent ligands 1-5 that contain both μ agonist and CB1 antagonist pharmacophores for use as tools to study the functional interaction between MOP and CB1 receptors in vivo. Immunofluorescent studies on HEK293 cells coexpressing both receptors suggested 5 (20-atom spacer) to be the only member of the series that bridges the protomers of the heteromer. Antinociceptive testing in mice revealed 5 to be the most potent member of the series.

A high throughput screening campaign, followed by medicinal chemistry optimization, led to the discovery of a non-peptidic β-arrestin biased agonist for NTR1. The lead compound, 2-cyclopropyl-6,7-dimethoxy-4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)- piperazin-1-yl)quinazoline, 32 (ML314), exhibits full agonist behavior against NTR1 (EC50 = 2.0 μM) in the primary assay and selectivity against NTR2. The effect of 32 is blocked by the NTR1 antagonist SR142948A in a dose dependent manner. Unlike peptide based NTR1 agonists, compound 32 has no significant response in a Ca(2+) mobilization assay and is thus a biased agonist that activates the β-arrestin pathway rather than the traditional G q coupled pathway. This bias has distinct biochemical and functional consequences that may lead to physiological advantages. Compound 32 displays good brain penetration in rodents, and studies examining its in vivo properties are underway.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2433830,20200629,53245590,174498737,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24611085,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

There is growing interest in developing biased G protein coupled receptor ligands to yield safer, better tolerated, and more efficacious drugs. The classical μ opioid morphine elicited increased efficacy and duration of analgesic response with reduced side effects in β-arrestin-2 knockout mice compared to wild-type mice, suggesting that G protein biased μ opioid receptor agonists would be more efficacious with reduced adverse events.

An in vitro study in the rat._||_Abstract: We have previously found that phenanthrenic opioids, including codeine, modulate morphine glucuronidation in the rat. Here codeine and five of its derivatives were compared in their effects on the synthesis of morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G) from morphine by rat liver microsomal preparations, and by primary cultures of rat hepatocytes previously incubated for 72 h with either codeine or its derivatives. Acetylcodeine and pivaloylcodeine shared the capability of the parent compound of inhibiting the synthesis of M3G by liver microsomes through a noncompetitive mechanism of action. Their IC50 were 3.25, 2.27, and 4.32 μM, respectively. Dihydrocodeine, acetyldihydrocodeine, and lauroylcodeine were ineffective. In all the experimental circumstances M6G was undetectable in the incubation medium. In primary hepatocyte cultures codeine only inhibited M3G formation, but with a lower efficacy than that observed with microsomes (IC50 20.91 vs 4.32 μM). Preliminary results show that at micromolar concentrations codeine derivatives exhibit a low rate of affinity for μ opiate receptors. In conclusion, acetyl and pivaloyl derivatives of codeine noncompetitively inhibit liver glucuronidation of morphine interacting with microsomes. This study further strengths the notion that phenanthrenic opioids can modulate morphine glucuronidation independently from their effects on μ opiate receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3096280,20200620,5284543|5288826|5463874|5486550|70187032|72736864,103169185|123090163|194152077|194159045|194186555|194186556,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24183585,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor.

TNKS inhibition has been shown to antagonize Wnt signaling via Axin stabilization in APC mutant colon cancer cell lines. We employed structure-based design to identify a series of 2-aminopyridine oxazolidinones as potent and selective TNKS inhibitors.

Y2 receptor is the most abundant Y subtype receptor in the central nervous system and implicated with food intake, bone formation, affective disorders, alcohol and drugs of abuse, epilepsy, pain, and cancer. The lack of small molecule non-peptidic Y2 receptor modulators suitable as in vivo pharmacological tools hampered the progress to uncover the precise pharmacological role of Y2.

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Part II._||_Abstract: The nociceptin opioid receptor (NOP) and its endogenous peptide ligand nociceptin/orphanin FQ have been shown to modulate the pharmacological effects of the classical opioid receptor system. Suppression of opioid-induced reward associated with mu-opioid receptor (MOP)-mediated analgesia, without decreasing anti-nociceptive efficacy, can potentially be achieved with NOP agonists having bifunctional agonist activity at MOP, to afford 'non-addicting' analgesics. In Part II of this series, we describe a continuing structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the NOP-selective piperidin-4-yl-1,3-dihydroindol-2-one scaffold, to obtain bifunctional activity at MOP, and a suitable ratio of NOP/MOP agonist activity that produces a non-addicting analgesic profile.

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285643,20200618,90678812|90678814,242640974|242640976,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

Currently, no small molecules displaying good affinity or selectivity for either subtype have been reported, to decipher the role of NPFF2-R as it relates to opioid-mediated analgesia, for further exploration of NPFF1-R, or for medication development for either subtype. We report the first nonpeptide small molecule scaffold for NPFF1,2-R, the guanidino-piperidines, and SAR studies resulting in the discovery of a NPFF1 agonist (7b, K(i) = 487 ± 117 nM), a NPFF1 antagonist (46, K(i) = 81 ± 17 nM), and a NPFF2 partial antagonist (53a, K(i) = 30 ± 5 nM), which serve as leads for the development of pharmacological probes and potential therapeutic agents.

The vast structural diversity of this group of polyketides is largely introduced by enzymatic oxidations, which can significantly influence the bioactivity profile. Four new compounds, griseorhodins D-F, were isolated from a griseorhodin producer, Streptomyces sp.

Two of these compounds, griseorhodins D1 and D2, were shown to be identical to the major, previously uncharacterized products of a grhM mutant in an earlier griseorhodin biosynthesis study. Their structures enabled the establishment of a more complete hypothesis for the biosynthesis of griseorhodins and related compounds.

As an approach to reducing side effects associated with κ opioid agonists, a series of β-naltrexamides 3-10 was synthesized in an effort to selectively target putative κ opioid heteromers without recruiting β-arrestin upon activation. The most potent derivative 3 (INTA) strongly activated KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR heteromers in HEK293 cells. In vivo studies revealed 3 to produce potent antinociception, which, when taken together with antagonism data, was consistent with the activation of both heteromers. 3 was devoid of tolerance, dependence, and showed no aversive effect in the conditioned place preference assay. As immunofluorescence studies indicated no recruitment of β-arrestin2 to membranes in coexpressed KOR-DOR cells, this study suggests that targeting of specific putative heteromers has the potential to identify leads for analgesics devoid of adverse effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3371069,20200623,102340665,312351639,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24978316,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

The competition binding assay showed two-atom spacer and aromatic side chain were optimal for MOR selectivity. Meanwhile, substitutions at the 1'- and/or 4'-position of the isoquinoline ring retained or improved MOR selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor while still possessing above 20-fold MOR selectivity over the delta opioid receptor.

Among this series of ligands, compound 11 acted as an antagonist when challenged with morphine in warm-water tail immersion assay and produced less significant withdrawal symptoms compared to naltrexone in morphine-pelleted mice. Compound 11 also antagonized the intracellular Ca(2+) increase induced by DAMGO. Molecular dynamics simulation studies of 11 in three opioid receptors indicated orientation of the 6'-nitro group varied significantly in the different 'address' domains of the receptors and played a crucial role in the observed binding affinities and selectivity.

Analogous to the now widely accepted rule of 5 in the design of oral drugs, the physicochemical properties required for optimal brain exposure have been extensively studied in an attempt to similarly define the attributes of successful CNS drugs and drug candidates.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts.

Here we describe the discovery, synthesis, and molecular pharmacology of δ-opioid receptor-selective positive allosteric modulators (δ PAMs). These δ PAMs increase the affinity and/or efficacy of the orthosteric agonists leu-enkephalin, SNC80 and TAN67, as measured by receptor binding, G protein activation, β-arrestin recruitment, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) activation.

Circular dichroism (CD) in H2O, trifluoroethanol (TFE), and SDS micelles confirmed the importance of the amphipathic helices (11s → 11sG → 11) for antinociception. The glycosylated analogues showed only nascent helices and random coil conformations in H2O. Chemical shift indices (CSI) and nuclear Overhauser effects (NOE) with 600 MHz NMR and CD confirmed helical structures in micelles, which were rationalized by molecular dynamics calculations. Antinociceptive studies with mice confirm that these glycosylated endorphin analogues are potential drug candidates that penetrate the BBB to produce potent central effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3599488,20200624,5462471|122183206|122183207|122183208|122183209|122183210|122183211|122183212|122183213|122183214|122183215|122183217|122183218|122183219|122183220|122183221|122183222|122183223|122183281|122183282|122183283|122183284,103217856|318379848|318379849|318379850|318379851|318379852|318379853|318379854|318379855|318379856|318379857|318379859|318379860|318379861|318379862|318379863|318379864|318379865|318379928|318379929|318379930|318379931,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26125201,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

In this report we synthesized analogs of a general sequence Dmt-c[D-Lys-Xaa-Yaa-Asp]NH2, with D-1- or D-2-naphthyl-3-alanine (D-1-Nal or D-2-Nal) in positions 3 or 4. In our earlier papers we have indicated that replacing a phenylalanine residue by the more extended aromatic system of naphthylalanines may result in increased bioactivities of linear analogs. The data obtained here showed that only cyclopeptides modified in position 4 retained the sub-nanomolar MOR and nanomolar κ-opioid receptor (KOR) affinity, similar but not better than that of a parent cyclopeptide. In the in vivo mouse hot-plate test, the most potent analog, Dmt-c[D-Lys-Phe-D-1-Nal-Asp]NH2, exhibited higher than EM-2 but slightly lower than the cyclic parent peptide antinociceptive activity after peripheral (ip) and also central administration (icv).

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

As the present study, a series of (4-arylpiperidine substituted-methyl)-[bicyclic (hetero)cycloalkanobenzene] analogs was designed, synthesized, and biologically evaluated in vitro to seek and identify potent and selective, small-molecules of nonpeptide NOP receptor antagonists, which resulted in the discovery of novel potent small-molecule 15 with high human NOP receptor selectivity over human μ receptor.

Important features of the cyclopropane ring are, the (1) coplanarity of the three carbon atoms, (2) relatively shorter (1.51 Å) C-C bonds, (3) enhanced π-character of C-C bonds, and (4) C-H bonds are shorter and stronger than those in alkanes. The present review will focus on the contributions that a cyclopropyl ring makes to the properties of drugs containing it. Consequently, the cyclopropyl ring addresses multiple roadblocks that can occur during drug discovery such as (a) enhancing potency, (b) reducing off-target effects,",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3857935,20200624,5284594,103256810,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27299736,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed. Compounds with a phenolic 4-hydroxy group do not form the hydrogen bond with His291, an important residue for KOP affinity and agonist activity. The size of the N-substituent hosted by the hydrophobic pocket formed by Val108, Ile316 and Tyr320 considerably influences binding and selectivity, with the n-alkyl size limit being five carbon atoms, while bulky substituents turn KOP agonists in antagonists. Thus, combination of experimental and molecular modeling strategies provides an initial framework for understanding the structural features of diphenethylamines that are essential to promote binding affinity and selectivity for the KOP receptor, and may be involved in transduction of the ligand binding event into molecular changes, ultimately leading to receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3858679,20200624,122589952|134139387|134147031,374283991|374295165|374322756,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27567368,0,NULL,P35372,9606,197,,NULL

This assay measures the functional properties of a compound by quantifying the level of G-protein activation following agonist binding in studies using stably transfected cells, and is considered to be a measure of the efficacy of a compound. Membranes from CHO (Chinese Hamster Ovary) cells that stably expressed the cloned human Mu opioid receptor were used in the experiments. Specifically, in a final volume of 0.5 mL, 12 different concentrations of each test compound were incubated with 7.5 ug of CHO cell membranes that stably expressed the human mu opioid receptor. The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EGTA, 3 uM GDP, and 100 mM NaCl. The final concentration of [35S]GTPgammaS was 0.080 nM.

In this study, we present a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of a recently discovered new class of tetrahydroisoquinoline κ opioid receptor antagonists which led to (3 R)-7-hydroxy- N-{(1 S)-2-methyl-1-[(-4-methylpiperidine-1-yl)methyl]propyl}-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (12) (4-Me-PDTic).

Compounds ZL0420 (28) and ZL0454 (35) were identified as potent and selective BRD4 inhibitors with nanomolar binding affinities to bromodomains (BDs) of BRD4. Both of them can be well docked into the acetyl-lysine (KAc) binding pocket of BRD4, forming key interactions including the critical hydrogen bonds with Asn140 directly and Tyr97 indirectly via a H2O molecule. Both compounds 28 and 35 exhibited submicromolar potency of inhibiting the TLR3-dependent innate immune gene program, including ISG54, ISG56, IL-8, and Groβ genes in cultured human small airway epithelial cells (hSAECs). More importantly, they also demonstrated potent efficacy reducing airway inflammation in a mouse model with low toxicity, indicating a proof of concept that BRD4 inhibitors may offer the therapeutic potential to block the viral-induced airway inflammation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4153185,20200618,137285009,404667290,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29649741,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

In a four step synthesis the methyl acetals 6 were converted into fluoroethyl derivatives 13 and 30. The most promising σ2 receptor ligand is the methyl acetal 6a bearing a 2,4-dimethylbenzylamino moiety. The fluoroethyl derivatives 13c and 13d reveal high σ1 affinity but moderate selectivity over the σ2 subtype. In mice 13c and 13d showed antiallodynic activity that is stronger than that of the reference σ1 antagonist BD-1063 (34). Since the antiallodynic activity of 13c could only be partially reversed by the σ1 agonist PRE-084 (35), it is postulated that a second mechanism contributes to its overall antiallodynic effect. In contrast, the antiallodynic effect of its diastereomer 13d can be totally explained by a σ1 antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4158755,20200618,145950456|145954168|145957598,404653361|404658708|404663690,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30350997,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Recently, many groups have sought MOR agonists that induce minimal βarrestin-mediated signaling because MOR agonist-treated βarrestin2 knockout mice were found to display enhanced antinociceptive effects with significantly less respiratory depression and tachyphylaxis. Substantial data now exists to support the premise that G protein signaling biased MOR agonists can be effective analgesic agents.

It is implicated in nociception, diuresis, emotion, cognition, and immune system functions. KOP agonists possess a strong analgesic effect accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria. On the other hand, antagonists of this receptor were found to block depression, anxiety, and drug-seeking behaviors in animal models. Recently, great interest has been given to the development of selective KOP antagonists as an addiction treatment that does not cause dependence itself or show high relapse rates like the currently used agents. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the KOP antagonists developed for this purpose together with their in vivo studies and clinical trials. In addition, a future perspective and recommendations for the work needed to develop clinically relevant KOP antagonists are presented.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4252125,20200619,145991902,404714933,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29107424,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, penfluridol anticancer activity was observed at a dosage significantly higher than that administered in antipsychotic therapy, thus raising the concern for the potential onset of CNS side effects in patients undergoing intensive pharmacological treatment.

The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models.

The κ-opioid receptor (KOR) has emerged as a promising target for both indications, raising demand for new chemotypes of KOR antagonists as well as G-protein-biased agonists. We employed the crystal structure of the KOR-JDTic complex and ligand-optimized structural templates to perform virtual screening of available compound libraries for new KOR ligands. The prospective virtual screening campaign yielded a high 32% hit rate, identifying novel fragment-like and lead-like chemotypes of KOR ligands. A round of optimization resulted in 11 new submicromolar KOR binders (best Ki = 90 nM). Functional assessment confirmed at least two compounds as potent KOR antagonists, while compound 81 was identified as a potent Gi biased agonist for KOR with minimal β-arrestin recruitment.

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite. Herein we describe the discovery of second-generation HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 with increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile achieved by reduction of phase 2 metabolism. Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, the clinical pharmacokinetics for PT2977 supports the hypothesis that attenuating the rate of glucuronidation would improve exposure and reduce variability in patients. Early evidence of clinical activity shows promise for PT2977 in the treatment of ccRCC.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4312701,20210302,117947097,440223752,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31282155,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

Further optimization of physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and safety parameters led to the identification of BAY-899 with an improved in vitro profile and proven efficacy in vivo.

Contrary to the classical monomeric model, indirect evidence suggests that ORs might form dimers, which could be endowed with a distinct pharmacological profile, and, thus, be targeted to develop innovative pharmacological therapies. However, direct evidence for the spontaneous formation of OR dimers in living cells under physiological conditions is missing. Despite a growing interest in the κ opioid receptor (KOR), KOR-selective fluorescent probes are particularly scarce in the literature. Herein, we present the first set of fluorescent KOR-selective probes with antagonistic properties. Two of these were employed in single-molecule microscopy (SMM) experiments to investigate KOR homodimerization, localization, and trafficking.

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis.

This analgesic effect is mediated principally by the activation of μ-opioid receptors (MOR). However, prolonged activation of MOR also results in tolerance, dependence, addiction, constipation, nausea, sedation, and respiratory depression. To address this problem, we sought alternative ways to activate MOR - either by use of novel ligands, or via a novel activation mechanism. To this end, a series of compounds were screened using a sensitive CHO-K1/MOR/Gα15 cell-based FLIPR<sup>®</sup> calcium high-throughput screening (HTS) assay, and the bithiazole compound 5a was identified as being able activate MOR in combination with naloxone.

GPCR ligands that differentially activate the downstream signaling pathways are termed functionally selective or biased ligands. A class of novel non-catechol G protein-biased agonists of the dopamine D<sub>1</sub> receptor (D<sub>1</sub>R) was recently disclosed. We conducted the first comprehensive structure-functional selectivity relationship study measuring G<sub>S</sub> and β-arrestin2 recruitment activities focused on four regions of this scaffold, resulting in over 50 analogs with diverse functional selectivity profiles. Some compounds became potent full agonists of β-arrestin2 recruitment, while others displayed enhanced G<sub>S</sub> bias compared to the starting compound. Pharmacokinetic testing of an analog with an altered functional selectivity profile demonstrated excellent blood-brain barrier penetration.

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396144,20210302,155565189,440218835,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM). Most of the synthesized ligands reveal either similar GluN2B and σ<sub>1</sub> affinity or higher σ<sub>1</sub> affinity than GluN2B affinity.

In this paper, we describe the discovery of 1-(6-ethyl-8-fluoro-4-methyl-3-(3-methyl-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)quinolin-2-yl)- N-(tetrahydro-2 H-pyran-4-yl)piperidin-4 amine (CYM-53093, BTRX-335140) as a potent and selective KOR antagonist, endowed with favorable in vitro ADMET and in vivo pharmacokinetic profiles and medication-like duration of action in rat pharmacodynamic experiments. Orally administered CYM-53093 showed robust efficacy in antagonizing KOR agonist-induced prolactin secretion and in tail-flick analgesia in mice. CYM-53093 exhibited a broad selectivity over a panel of off-target proteins.

Metabolic instability or predicted toxicity has precluded successful translation of previously reported D3R-selective antagonists to clinical use for cocaine abuse. Herein, we report a series of novel and D3R crystal structure-guided 4-phenylpiperazines with exceptionally high D3R affinities and/or selectivities with varying efficacies. Lead compound 19 was selected based on its in vitro profile: D3R Ki = 6.84 nM, 1700-fold D3R versus D2R binding selectivity, and its metabolic stability in mouse microsomes. Compound 19 inhibited oxycodone-induced hyperlocomotion in mice and reduced oxycodone-induced locomotor sensitization. In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429168,20210302,130431318,440152147,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,NULL,P35372,9606,NULL,,NULL

In vitro, 3 and its analogs were potent agonists in [(35)S]GTPγS assays at the mu opioid receptor but failed to recruit β-arrestin-2, which is associated with opioid side effects.

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430768,20210302,104787|3036289|5462471|123445395|155515838|155522689|155530357|155553117|155558752|155563934,103202725|103217856|123099351|336866137|440117795|440128385|440140127|440188464|440202620|440215673,4988,NULL,P35372,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,NULL,P35372,9606,45,,NULL

A preponderance of preclinical data and clinical observations established p38αMAPK as a brain drug discovery target involved in neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction in multiple degenerative and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. We summarize the discovery of highly selective, brain-penetrant, small molecule p38αMAPK inhibitors that are efficacious in diverse animal models of neurologic disorders. A crystallography and pharmacoinformatic approach to fragment expansion enabled the discovery of an efficacious hit.

The peptide hormone ghrelin exerts pleiotropic effects including the stimulation of growth hormone secretion and subsequent increase of insulin-like growth factor-1 levels, an important mediator of muscle growth and repair. Ghrelin also acts on inflammation, appetite, and adipogenesis and therefore has been considered a promising therapeutic target for catabolic conditions. We previously reported on the synthesis and properties of an indane based series of ghrelin receptor full agonists which led to a sustained increase of insulin-like growth factor-1 in a dog pharmacodynamic study.

Poor metabolic stability and ineffective analgesia after peripheral administration were detrimental for the use of EMs as novel clinical analgesics. Therefore, here, we aimed to establish new EM analogs via introducing different bifunctional d-amino acids at position 2 of [(2-furyl)Map<sup>4</sup>]EMs. The combination of [(2-furyl)Map<sup>4</sup>]EMs with D-Arg<sup>2</sup> or D-Cit<sup>2</sup> yielded analogs with enhanced binding affinity to the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) and increased stability against enzymatic degradation (t<sub>1/2</sub> > 300 min). However, the agonistic activities of these analogs toward MOR were slightly reduced.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent.

Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_Summary of Probe Development Effort:_||_This probe development effort is focused on the identification of agonists of heterodimerization of the mu 1 (OPRM1) and delta 1 (OPRD1) opioid receptors.

For example, targeting of opiod receptors by opiates such as morphine is a widespread clinical application for GPCR modulation in pain management. The recently de-orphanized GPR7 (5) is localized predominantly in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex (6), with additional expression in the pituitary, hippocampus, amygdala, and spinal cord (7-9). GPR7 is highly conserved in humans and rodents (6), and exhibits structural features of both GPCRs and somatostatin receptors (7). Studies identifying the energy-regulating neuropeptides Neuropeptide W (NPW) and Neuropeptide B (NPB) as endogenous ligands of GPR7 (5, 10), and the development of hyperphagia and obesity in male GPR7 knockout mice (11, 12), implicate GPR7 in feeding behavior. Additional studies identifying GPR7 expression in peripheral Schwann cells (13) and increased GPR7 expression in rat models and human patients with inflammation-associated neuropathic pain (11, 13), suggest a role for GPR7 in mediating the inflammatory pain response. The identification of modulators of GPR7 will provide useful tools to elucidate the diverse roles of this receptor in central neuropeptide signaling and nociception in general._||_References:_||_1.

Studies identifying the energy-regulating neuropeptides Neuropeptide W (NPW) and Neuropeptide B (NPB) as endogenous ligands of GPR7 (5, 10), and the development of hyperphagia and obesity in male GPR7 knockout mice (11, 12), implicate GPR7 in feeding behavior. Additional studies identifying GPR7 expression in peripheral Schwann cells (13) and increased GPR7 expression in rat models and human patients with inflammation-associated neuropathic pain (11, 13), suggest a role for GPR7 in mediating the inflammatory pain response. The identification of modulators of GPR7 will provide useful tools to elucidate the diverse roles of this receptor in central neuropeptide signaling and nociception in general._||_References:_||_1.

These responses are mediated through high-affinity interactions with five members of the endothelial differentiation gene (EDG) family of plasma membrane-localized G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the sphingosine lipid receptors, S1P1-5 (8-10). S1P3 receptor couples promiscuously to Gi, Gq, and G12/13 proteins (11-13). Its expression is widespread (14-16). The S1P3 knockout mouse is phenotypically normal (14). Most S1P-mediated responses on endothelial cells occur via the S1P1 receptor alone or in combination with the S1P3 receptor. Bradycardia and hypertension are clearly associated with S1P3 activation and its expression patterns in cardiac tissue (3, 17). The use of the S1P1-selective agonist SEW2871 together with S1P3-deletant mice showed that activation of S1P3 regulates sinus rhythm, whereas activation of S1P1 plays no discernable role in the process (4). S1P3 on dendritic cells has been identified as a major exacerbating factor for mortality during sepsis by playing a role in the critical linkage of inflammation and coagulation pathways downstream of the thrombin cascade (18). A potent and selective S1P3 agonist would be useful in dissecting the complexities of S1P-mediated physiological processes in which S1P3 is involved, including bradycardia and hypertension._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function (1, 2). In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 (3). Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain(4). These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (5-7)._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.

It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6).

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively modulate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_Summary of Probe Development Effort:_||_This probe development effort is focused on the identification of inverse agonists of heterodimerization of the mu 1 (OPRM1) and delta 1 (OPRD1) opioid receptors.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Galphai and Galphao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively modulate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use. The goal of this project is identification of HTR5A inverse agonists._||_References:_||_1. Raehal KM, Bohn LM. Mu opioid receptor regulation and opiate responsiveness.

Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive phospholipid released by activated blood platelets and serves to influence endothelial integrity, lung epithelial integrity (1), and lymphocyte recirculation (2-5) through five related high affinity G-protein coupled receptors. Recently, modulation of S1P receptors locally in the lungs was shown to alter dendritic cell activation and accumulation in the mediastinal lymph nodes, resulting in blunted T cell responses and control of immunopathological features of influenza virus infection (6). Reports showing that S1P5 expression is very low in dendritic cells but that S1P4 is highly expressed (7), suggest that chemical activation of the S1P4 receptor subtype in the airways could be efficient at controlling the immunopathological response to viral infection. S1P4 is coupled to Gai and Gao G-proteins and activates ERK MAPK and PLC downstream pathways (8), indicating that selective antagonists of S1P4 may also serve as useful tools for understanding S1P4 biological function._||_References:_||_1.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function (1, 2). In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 (3). Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain(4). These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (5-7)._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.

The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

Serotonin mediates much of its actions by binding to and activating G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) on the surface of neurons and other cells. One of these GPCRs, the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR), is a 7-transmembrane spanning GPCR in the frontal cortex which impacts on development, anxiety, depression, perception, and cognitive function (1, 2). In neurons, the 5-HT2AR is a constitutively internalizing receptor and this trafficking is dependent upon interactions with the regulatory protein, Beta-arrestin2 (3). Studies in cell-based assays reveal that serotonin requires Beta-arrestin2 to internalize the receptors while other agonists, such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine, internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). All 5-HT2AR agonists seem to recruit Beta-arrestin2 to 5-HT2AR in cultured cells. However, while serotonin requires Beta-arrestins to traffic receptors, other agonists such as DOI, 5-MeO-DMT, and quipazine can internalize the receptor in the absence of Beta-arrestins (3, 4). It remains to be determined if the specific 5-HT2AR-Beta-arrestin interactions and trafficking events have physiological significance. It is conceivable that the regulation of 5-HT2AR in vivo may impact neurological sensitivity to serotonin and the responsiveness to pharmacological agents and drugs of abuse. We predict that drugs that disrupt the serotonin 2A receptor-Beta-arrestin interaction might provide a means to alter the sensitivity of the receptor to the levels of serotonin present in the brain(4). These findings may inspire the development of drugs that could be clinically useful for treating depression, schizophrenia, and drug addiction (5-7)._||_References:_||_1. Hsieh, C.L., A.M.

The lack of selective, brain-penetrant and orally active AVPR1a antagonists hampers the progress in our understanding of the precise/complete pharmacological role of AVPR1a in central nervous system disorders and the development of novel treatments for these disorders. The optimization of promising AVPR1a antagonist lead compounds and testing in known and relevant in vivo animal models will be a significant step forward in our understanding of the role of AVPR1a in CNS disorders and in the development of novel treatments of anxiety, depression and PTSD. It is estimated that over 15 million people in the USA suffer from major depression and is increasing. The current treatments are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for which some 60% of patients do not respond [1-2]. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects 7-8 million people in the US that have experienced a major traumatic effect in their lifetime, this is a particular area of focus for the military where up to 30% of combatants experience PTSD on their return from a tour of duty having experienced combat (for example in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq). A significant therapeutic need, the support of pre-clinical data and the lack of brain-penetrant, orally active AVPR1a antagonists emphasize the significance of this opportunity. Our aim is to identify a novel, selective, orally bioavailable and brain penetrant AVPR1a antagonist._||_References:_||_1.
