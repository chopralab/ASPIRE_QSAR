All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754635,20181015,44353390|44353391|44353454|44353457|44353458|44353468,103365942|103365943|103366138|103366152|103366153|103366185,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

In the guinea pig ileum preparation (GPI), all compounds except 8 were partial agonists. The ligands that were evaluated in mice were found to produce antinociception that was not selectively mediated via delta opioid receptors. However, two of these ligands (4 and 5) appeared to be delta-selective opioid receptor antagonists at subthreshold doses for antinociception. The finding that all of the compounds bind selectively to delta opioid receptors in guinea pig brain membranes together with the in vitro pharmacology and in vivo antagonist studies suggests that the lack of delta agonist selectivity in vivo may be due to a number of factors, including a basic difference between the delta receptor system in the MVD and in the mouse brain.

In binding studies based on displacement of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor selective radiolabels from guinea pig brain membranes, the new analogues showed a negligible affinity for the kappa binding site and a preference for mu- over delta-receptors with an evident dependence on N- and/or C-terminal modifications; H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-OCH3 was shown to be one of the most selective mu-receptor ligands reported to date. All these tetrapeptides display dose-related naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effects following intracerebroventricular (icv) or subcutaneous (sc) administrations in mice. In comparison to morphine, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and the guanidino derivative H2NC = (NH)-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-NH2 showed lower affinity for mu, delta, and kappa sites but exceptionally stronger analgesia: respectively they are 560 and 1550 times as potent an analgesic as morphine. Among analogues tested after sc administration, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-D-Ala-OH displayed the highest activities; they were respectively 22 and 30 times more potent than morphine on a molar basis.

Both 2 and 3 were found to be selective kappa opioid receptor antagonists in smooth muscle preparations, and they bound selectively to kappa-recognition sites. The thiophene analogue 2 displayed binding selectivity that was of the same order of magnitude as that of 1a, while 3 was considerably less selective for kappa site. This is consistent with the fact that the second pharmacophore in 1a and 2 displayed a greater degree of superposition than 1a and 3. The results of this study suggest that the pyrrole moiety of norBNI functions primarily as an inert spacer to rigidly hold the basic nitrogen in the second pharmacophore at an 'address' subsite that is unique for the kappa opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754285,20181013,46877617,103734661,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1849995,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754287,20181010,73346658|73347231|73350321,174489529|174490340|174500605,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,NULL,P41143,10029,NULL,,NULL

Their binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were evaluated using receptor binding assay. It was observed that the affinity of these compounds was sensitive to the character and length of the substituent in position 4. Further prolongation of the 4-alkoxy group of cyprodime (1) and its 4-butoxy analogue 2 is detrimental for the mu opioid receptor affinity. Introduction of an arylalkoxy group at C-4 does not increase mu affinity in the case of benzyloxy, while a phenylpropoxy group reduces mu affinity. The delta and kappa affinities were also reduced compared to the reference compounds. A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

A significant increase in the affinity at the mu opioid receptors was achieved by introducing a 14-phenylpropoxy group. Increases in the affinity at delta and kappa receptors were also observed. These findings provide further evidence that the nature of the substituent at position 14 has a major impact on the abilities of morphinans to interact with opioid receptors. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, all tested compounds were partial agonists at mu and delta receptors. Compounds 8 and 17 showed antagonism at kappa receptors, while compound 7 exhibited some partial agonist activity at this receptor. The novel derivatives of cyprodime containing a 14-phenylpropoxy group acted as potent antinociceptives. When tested in vivo, compounds 7, 8, and 17 were considerably more potent than morphine, with phenol 7 showing the highest antinociceptive potency (21-fold in the hot plate test, 38-fold in the tail flick test, and 300-fold in the paraphenylquinone writhing test) in mice. Introduction of a 14-phenylpropoxy substituent leads to a profound alteration in the pharmacological profile of this class of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751924,20181017,5748293|44339409|44339472|44339475|44339521,103332294|103332388|103332565|103332568|103332685,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15163203,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,197,,NULL

148085,Confirmatory,"Binding affinity was measured against cloned human Opioid receptor delta 1 (wild-type,Wt)","Title: De novo design, synthesis, and biological activities of high-affinity and selective non-peptide agonists of the delta-opioid receptor._||_Abstract: On the basis of the structure-activity relationships of delta-opioid-selective peptide ligands and on a model of the proposed bioactive conformation for a potent and selective, conformationally constrained delta-opioid peptide ligand [(2S, 3R)-TMT1]DPDPE, a series of small organic peptide mimetic compounds targeted for the delta-opioid receptor have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated in radiolabeled ligand binding assays and in vitro bioassays. The new non-peptide ligands use piperazine as a template to present the most important pharmacophore groups, including phenol and phenyl groups and a hydrophobic moiety. This hydrophobic group was designed to mimic the hydrophobic character of the D-Pen residues in DPDPE, which has been found to be extremely important for increasing the binding affinity and selectivity of these non-peptide ligands for the delta-opioid receptor over the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6f (SL-3111) showed 8 nM binding affinity and over 2000-fold selectivity for the delta-opioid receptor over the mu-opioid receptor. Both enantiomers of SL-3111 were separated, and the (-)-isomer was shown to be the compound with the highest affinity for the delta-opioid receptor found in our study (IC50 = 4.1 nM), with a selectivity very similar to that observed for the racemic compound. The phenol hydroxyl group of SL-3111 turned out to be essential to maintain high affinity for the delta-opioid receptor, which also was observed in the case of the delta-opioid-selective peptide ligand DPDPE. Binding studies of SL-3111 and [p-ClPhe4]DPDPE on the cloned wild-type and mutated human delta-opioid receptors suggested that the new non-peptide ligand has a binding profile similar to that of DPDPE but different from that of (+)-4-[((alphaR)-alpha(2S,5R)-4-allyl-2, 5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC-80), another delta-opioid-selective non-peptide ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750419,20181016,123924|159564|9909743,103175041|103385063|103385064,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9822547,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis and evaluation of N-alkyl-substituted (alpha-piperazinylbenzyl)benzamides as novel, highly selective delta opioid receptor agonists._||_Abstract: A series of N-alkyl- and N,N-dialkyl-4-[alpha-[(2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl] benzyl]-benzamides were synthesized and evaluated for binding affinities at mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor subtypes. Several compounds (2e,f,h,i,m) strongly bound to the delta receptor with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. On the other hand, the binding affinities of these compounds for the mu and kappa receptors were in the micromolar or greater range indicating excellent delta opioid receptor subtype selectivities. In this series, two important structure-activity relationships were found for the delta receptor binding affinity. First, the spatial orientation of the alpha-benzylic position influenced the affinities with the alpha R derivatives 2a-n generally showing more than 10-fold greater affinity than the alpha S derivatives 3a-n. Second, the binding affinities were strongly influenced by the number of alkyl substituents on the amide nitrogen. N-Monoalkylbenzamide derivatives 2b-d showed lower affinity than N,N-dialkylbenzamide derivatives 2e-n, and the N-unsubstituted benzamide derivative 2a had the lowest affinity for the delta receptor in the series. The dramatic effect of the amide group substitution pattern on the binding affinity for the delta receptor strongly suggests that the amide function is an important structural element in the interaction of this series of compounds at the delta receptor. Selective compounds in this series were examined for binding affinity in cloned human mu and delta receptors. The results obtained generally paralleled those from the rat brain binding assay. Compounds 2e,f with potent delta binding affinities and high delta selectivities were shown to be delta agonists with high selectivity by studies in the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. Compound 2f was the most selective compound in the rat brain and GPI/MVD assays with 1755- and 958-fold delta vs mu selectivity, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750421,20181015,123924|10388274|10576543|10648307|10695990|10718848|10719414|10788324|10837156,103175041|103315823|103315854|103315897|103315898|103316195|103316196|103316231|103316615,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9288176,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons.

These dimeric ligands can be viewed as dimeric morphinans, which were formed by coupling two identical morphinan pharmacophores (cyclorphan (1) or MCL 101 (2)) with varying connecting spacers. Ligands 6 and 7 with alkyl spacers on the nitrogen position and ligands 8 and 9 in which the two morphinan pharmacophores were coupled by ether moieties at the 3-hydroxyl positions showed significant decrease in affinity at all three opioid receptors. An improvement in the affinity was achieved by introducing an ester moiety as the spacer in the dimeric morphinans. It was observed that the affinity of these ligands was sensitive to the character and length of the spacer. Compound 13 (MCL-139) with a 4-carbon ester spacer, compound 17 (MCL-144) containing a 10-carbon spacer, and compound 19 (MCL-145) with the conformationally constrained fumaryl spacer were the most potent ligands in this series, displaying excellent affinities at micro and kappa receptors (K(i) = 0.09-0.2 nM at micro and K(i) = 0.078-0.049 nM at kappa), which were comparable to the parent compound 2. Ligand 12, a compound containing only one morphinan pharmacophore and a long-chain ester group, had affinity at both micro and kappa receptors almost identical to that of the parent ligand 2. In the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay, ligands 13, 17, and 19 and their parent morphinans 1 and 2 stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding mediated by the micro and kappa receptors. Compounds 13 and 17 were full kappa agonists and partial micro agonists, while compound 19 was a partial agonist at both micro and kappa receptors.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address. It is interesting to note the structural commonality (an amino and phenol groups) in both the message and address components of JDTic.

These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand.

On the other hand, (+)-3 and the more potent enantiomers of methadone, (-)-1, and isomethadone, (-)-2, appear to have less mu-receptor selectivity and interact with a greater fraction of delta receptors than does (-)-3.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions.

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective. The results with substitution of beta-MeTyr or Hat instead of Tyr also demonstrate that topographical modification in a conformationally restricted ligand can significantly modulate both potency and receptor selectivity of peptide ligands that have multiple sites of biological activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757182,20181013,44299404|44316570|44316571|44316856,103243877|103279850|103279851|103280379,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1320122,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The benzofuran (NTB), quinoxaline, and quinoline analogues (2, 3, and 4, respectively) were delta-selective opioid antagonists in vitro and bound selectively to delta receptors. The tetrahydroindole derivative 5, while delta-selective, was considerably less potent than its indole analogue 13. The data for 2-4 indicate that heterocycles other than pyrrole can serve as a spacer for the delta address moiety. Moreover, the lower delta antagonist potency of 5 illustrates the importance of the aromatic address component. Molecular dynamics simulations of enkephalin using a zipper binding model are consistent with a delta address subsite that may accommodate the benzene moiety of NTI or the Phe4 phenyl group of leucine enkephalin. The considerably lower delta opioid receptor antagonist potencies of the 6-aryl derivatives 6-8 are consistent with the conformational mobility of the aryl group and its location in the molecule.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL882757,20181013,46877644,103734704,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1851846,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The methyl-substituted derivatives (+/-)-trans-N, alpha-dimethyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzo-[b] thiophene-4-acetamide monohydrochloride (6a,b) possess significantly weaker affinity than 1 for the kappa opioid receptor (Ki = 172 and 3.7 nM, respectively). It is proposed that this is due to the conformational restriction imposed by the methyl group of 6. In order to test this proposal the acenaphthene derivative and the 4,5-dihydro-3H-naphtho [1,8-bc]thiophene derivative were prepared. The acenaphthene derivative (+)-N-methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidinyl)-1-oxaspiro [4.5]dec-8-yl]acenaphthenecarboxamide monohydrochloride (9) was found to have high kappa opioid receptor affinity and selectivity (kappa Ki = 0.37 +/- 0.05 nM, mu/kappa = 659, delta/kappa = 1562) and is 100 times more potent than morphine as an analgesic in the rat paw pressure test for analgesia after intravenous administration (MPE50 = 0.014 and 1.4 mg/kg, respectively).

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective.

Chromatography of the mixture resulted in conversion of the bulk of the thiol 9 to the disulfide 13 by air oxidation. The disulfide 13 was also prepared by condensing the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether of 4 with the dithiodiglycolyl chloride and treating the resulting product with F- to give the desired product. The pure thiol 9 free of contamination with the disulfide was prepared by treating 13 with excess N-acetyl-L-cysteine and processing the reaction mixture without resorting to chromatography for purification. The corresponding N-(cyclopropylmethyl) nor compound 15 was prepared from the silyl ether 6 and acetylthioglycolyl chloride followed by hydrolysis, treatment with F-, and air oxidation. Incubation of bovine striatal membranes with 13 and 15 resulted in wash-resistant inhibition of the binding of the mu-selective peptide [3H][D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,Gly(ol)5]-enkephalin (DAMGO). Incubation of membranes with mu but not kappa or delta ligands protected the mu binding sites from alkylation by 13 and 15. The wash-resistant inhibition of mu opioid binding was partially reversed by the addition of the reducing reagent dithiothreitol (DTT). A Scatchard plot of the effect of 13 and 15 on [3H]DAMGO binding showed that these affinity ligands caused a marked decrease in the Bmax value without affecting the Kd value.

The affinities of the target compounds for the mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors were determined by radiolabeled binding experiments using bovine brain membranes. An analogous series of 7,8-dihydrocodeinones and morphinones was prepared and assayed in the same systems. The 3-methoxy derivatives 3 and 4 were more selective than the corresponding morphinones for the mu receptor. The 5 beta-methylcodeinones 25 and 27 had lower affinity at all receptors than the corresponding morphinones, but the 5 beta-methylmorphinones had affinities similar to the morphinones 5 and 6. A similar pattern was observed in the 7,8-dihydro series. Two compounds, 5 beta-methyl-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydromorphinone, 20 (MET-CAMO), and N-(cyclopropylmethyl)-14 beta-[(p-nitrocinnamoyl)amino]-7,8-dihydronormorphinone, 22 (N-CPM-MET- CAMO), acted as nonequilibrium ligands in antinociception and membrane binding studies. In mice after icv administration, neither ligand showed any agonist activity but 8-24 h after administration both compounds acted as potent mu antagonists. A Scatchard plot of the effect of N-CPM-MET-CAMO on [3H]DAMGO ([3H]D-Ala2, (Me)-Phe4, Gly(ol)5] enkephalin) binding to bovine striatal membranes showed that there was a significant decrease in the Bmax value and a marginal effect on the Kd value suggesting that the number of binding sites was reduced. When taken together, these results support the view that 20 and 22 bind covalently to the mu receptor. On the other hand, when N-acetylcysteine and 22 were allowed to react in a buffered solution, 22 was recovered unchanged. Under these conditions no Michael reaction was observed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753264,20181013,11849246|11849365|44336988|44337160|44337164|44337243|44337264|44337269|44337271|44337273|44337274|44337275|44337276|44337314|44337316|44337344|46878245,103327006|103327386|103327396|103327546|103327576|103327594|103327603|103327611|103327612|103327613|103327614|103327722|103327724|103327783|103734817|103734823|103735536,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7693944,0,NULL,P41143,9913,NULL,,NULL
149481,Confirmatory,Binding affinity towards Opioid receptor delta 1,"Title: Phenylmorphans and analogues: opioid receptor subtype selectivity and effect of conformation on activity._||_Abstract: The morphine-like (+)-phenylmorphan, the atypical (-)-enantiomer, and some analogues have been tested in receptor binding assays selective for opioid mu 1, mu 2, delta, kappa 1, and kappa 3 receptors. The affinities of all of the compounds except one, including the atypical (-)-phenylmorphan, were greatest for mu 1 and mu 2 receptors. The only exception was the (+)-9 alpha-methyl analogue which had slightly greater affinity for the kappa 1 receptor. The selective receptor binding assays provide evidence that opioids in which the phenyl ring is constrained to be equatorial on the piperidine ring can have considerable affinity for mu receptors. In addition, dose-response curves were determined for (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan using the mouse tail-flick assay with the (+)-enantiomer found to be about 7 times more potent. Pretreatment with the selective opioid antagonists beta-FNA (mu 1 and mu 2), naloxonazine (mu 1), nor-BNI (kappa 1), and naltrindole (delta) suggests that the antinociceptive activity of both enantiomers is mediated through mu receptors. The pretreatment with naloxonazine, which attenuated the antinociceptive effect, shows that both (+)- and (-)-phenylmorphan are mu 1 agonists while intrathecal administration shows that both are mu 2 agonists. Conformational energy calculations on the compounds were also performed using the MM2-87 program. Consistent with previous conformational results for the phenylmorphans (J. Med. Chem. 1984, 27, 1234-1237), the most potent antinociceptive compounds preferred a particular orientation of the phenyl ring.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753266,20181013,5288826|12368881|44284742|44285029|44285070|44299404,103169185|103213590|103213625|103214145|103214210|103243877,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1315868,0,NULL,P41143,9913,NULL,,NULL

It was shown that high-affinity, fully efficacious, and delta opioid receptor-selective compounds can be obtained from this transposition. In addition to the N,N-diethylamido group needed as the delta address, the structural features identified to promote delta receptor affinity in the set of compounds studied included a cis relative stereochemistry between the 3- and 4-substituents in the piperidine ring, a trans-crotyl or allyl substituent on the basic nitrogen, the lack of a 2-methyl group in the piperidine ring, and either no substitution or hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring not substituted with the N,N-diethylamido group. Structural features found to be important for mu affinity include hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring, the presence of a 2-methyl group in a cis relative relationship to the 4-amino group as well as N-substituents such as cyclopropylmethyl. It was also determined that mu receptor affinity could be increased while maintaining delta receptor affinity, especially when hydroxyl-substituted compounds are considered. Additionally, it was discovered that the somewhat lower mu/delta selectivities observed for the piperidine compounds relative to the piperazine-based ligands appear to arise as a consequence of the carbon-nitrogen transposition which imparts an overall lower delta and higher mu affinity to the piperidine-based ligands. This higher affinity for the mu receptor, apparently intrinsic to the piperidine-based compounds, suggests that ligands of this class will more easily be converted to mu/delta combination agonists compared to the piperazine ligands such as 1. This is particularly important since analogues of 1, which show both mu- and delta-type activity, are now recognized as important for their strong analgesia and cross-canceling of many of the side effects found in agonists operating exclusively from either the delta or mu opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL752607,20181017,105104|5462471|10320022|10410736,103177815|103217856|103435316|163333315,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11300879,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

In smooth muscle preparations, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the affinity labels 3-6 behaved as kappa agonists in that they were potently antagonized by norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). In addition to the high binding affinity and selectivity of the 3-isothiocyanate 3 (DIPPA) to kappa opioid receptors, wash studies have suggested that this involves covalent binding. In the mouse tail-flick assay, the 3- and 4-substituted isomers (3 and 5, respectively) produced long-lasting antagonism of the antinociceptive effect of the kappa opioid agonist, (+/-)-trans-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]acetamide ((+/-)-U50,488).

The improved kappa-selectivities of 3 and 4 and the different agonist and antagonist potencies of 3 and 5 may be explained respectively by the existence of multiple kappa agonist binding sites and distinct agonist and antagonist binding sites.

Pharmacological studies of SNF 9007 suggest a relationship between the ligand requirements of CCK-B and delta-opioid receptors, which further implies a possible structural relationship between these receptors. We have utilized topographical constrainment of the important Trp30 residue to investigate structural features of SNF 9007 that would distinguish between binding requirements in this region for the CCK-B and delta-opioid receptors. Thus, the four optically pure isomers of beta-MeTrp were substituted for L-Trp30 of SNF 9007. Receptor binding results suggest that the preferred topography of the Trp30 residue for CCK-B receptor binding may be the 2S,3S (erythro-L) configuration whereas for the delta-opioid receptor it may be the 2S,3R (threo-L) configuration. Molecular modeling studies of these ligands further support the recently revised receptor-bound model for CCK-B octapeptide ligands (Kolodziej et al. J. Med.

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective.

The lowest energy conformation was found to exhibit an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence. It was suggested that an alpha-helical conformation in the cyclized address sequence or a helical conformation induced by the conformational characteristics of the message sequence may be important for binding potency and kappa opioid receptor selectivity. Side chain to side chain lactam bridges between the i and i + 4 positions have been shown to stabilize alpha-helical conformation. Thus, a series of cyclic lactam analogues of dynorphin A(1-11)-NH2 have been designed, synthesized and evaluated by the guinea pig brain (GPB) binding assay and guinea pig ileum (GPI) bioassay to evaluate the conformational analysis prediction and, further, to investigate the conformational requirements for high potency and selectivity for kappa opioid receptors. Positions 2-6, 3-7, and 5-9 were chosen as the sites for incorporating cyclic conformational constraints. Cyclization between D-Asp(2) and Lys(6) in c[D-Asp(2),Lys(6)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to an analogue with pronounced potency and selectivity enhancement for the mu opioid receptor, whereas cyclization between D-Asp(3) and Lys(7) in c[D-Asp(3),Lys(7)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to a potent ligand (IC(50) 4.9 nM) with kappa receptor selectivity. The other analogues in the series proved to be less selective. The biological results led to the suggestion that the binding conformation for the kappa receptor may have structural requirements that are distinct from those of mu and delta receptors. Interestingly, analogues with a D-Asp at position 2, 3, or 9 were found to be more potent for the kappa receptor than analogues with an L-Asp at the same positions. It is suggested that the incorporation of D-Asp into position 2, 3, or 9 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 may have stereochemical and conformational effects on the nearby amino acids which can help discriminate the preference between kappa, mu, and delta receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750005,20181015,10677974,103241617,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8676350,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The glycine residues in the 2 and 3 positions of dynorphin A may affect the relative orientation of the aromatic rings in positions 1 and 4, but their flexibility precludes careful analysis. To examine these effects on dynorphin A, we previously have synthesized the linear analogues [D-Ala3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (2) and [Ala3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (3) and reported their biological activities. Analogues 2 and 3 displayed affinities for the central kappa opioid receptor (IC50 = 0.76 and 1.1 nM, respectively) similar to that of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1) (IC50 = 0.58 nM) and greatly enhanced selectivities for kappa vs mu and kappa vs delta receptors (IC50 ratios of 350 and 1300 for 2, and 190 and 660 for 3, respectively).

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance. These results indicate that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan templates could provide ligands with mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist profiles and such ligands may have the potential of emerging as novel analgesic drugs devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751659,20181018,10050608|11282704|11292839,103734931|103734934|103734937,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14998329,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The potency and selectivity (delta- vs mu- and kappa-opioid receptor) were evaluated by radioreceptor binding assays. Agonist or antagonist potency were assayed in the mouse vas deferens and in the guinea pig ileum. In the TIPP analogues containing L-beta-methyl amino acids the influence on delta-receptor affinity and on delta-antagonist potency is limited, the [(2S,3R)-beta-MePhe3]TIPP-OH analogue being among the most potent delta-antagonists reported. In the D-beta-methyl amino acid series, the [D-beta-MeTic2] analogues are delta-selective antagonists whereas [D-Tic2]TIPP-NH2 is a delta-agonist. NMR studies did not indicate any influence of the beta-methyl substituent on the conformation of the Tic residue. The [(2R,3S)-beta-MePhe3]TIPP-NH2 is a potent delta-agonist, its C-terminal carboxylic acid analogue being more delta-selective but displaying partial agonism in both the delta- and mu-bioassay.

The glycine residues in the 2 and 3 positions of dynorphin A may affect the relative orientation of the aromatic rings in positions 1 and 4, but their flexibility precludes careful analysis. To examine these effects on dynorphin A, we previously have synthesized the linear analogues [D-Ala3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (2) and [Ala3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (3) and reported their biological activities.

It appears that kappa-agonist binding of the orvinols avoids the inhibitory site in the intramolecular H-bonded conformation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753663,20181017,49799964,103770293,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10794701,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

I: Phe3 replacement with ring-substituted and heterocyclic amino acids._||_Abstract: In order to assess steric, lipophilic, and electronic influences on opioid binding affinity, analogs of the delta receptor selective peptide deltorphin I (Tyr-D-Ala-Phe-Asp-Val-Val-GlyNH2) were prepared in which the residue 3 phenylalanine was replaced with lipophilic fluoro- and methyl-substituted phenylalanines or with the heterocyclic aromatic amino acids 3-(4-thiazolyl)alanine, 3-(2-pyridyl)alanine, 3-(3-pyridyl)alanine, histidine, and 3-(4-thiazolyl)alanine. mu binding was variable, with KiS in excess of 10,000 nM for most analogs, and all of the analogs bound poorly to k receptors. Among the phenyl ring-substituted analogs, those containing the smaller and electron-withdrawing halogens were favored over those with larger, electron-releasing methyl groups, although delta opioid binding affinity was reduced in all cases. The m-fluorophenylalanine analog demonstrated the best delta binding of the group, with a Ki of 4.79 nM. Within the group of heterocyclic analogs, 3-(2-thienyl)alanine proved to be the best modification, displaying a delta receptor Ki of 1.38 nM, while the polar histidine analog suffered the greatest loss in delta binding (Ki = 317). Compounds containing pyridylalanine and thiazolylalanine were intermediate in binding affinity, with delta KiS ranging from 39.5 to 62.4 nM.

The compounds were biased toward opioid receptor antagonist activity by incorporating (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (a potent, nonselective opioid pure antagonist) as one of the monomers. The other two monomers, which included N-substituted or unsubstituted Boc-protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity. Screening of these compounds in competitive binding experiments with the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [3H]U69,593 led to the discovery of a novel kappa opioid receptor selective ligand, N-¿(2'S)-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamido]-3'-methylbutyl¿-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (8, RTI-5989-29). Additional structure-activity relationship studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen-bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. These sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-fold increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu-selective ligand, (+)-N-[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a). The degree of selectivity observed in the radioligand binding experiments was not observed in the functional assay. According to its ability to inhibit agonist stimulated binding of [35S]GTPgammaS at all three opioid receptors, compound 8 behaves as a mu/kappa opioid receptor pure antagonist with negligible affinity for the delta receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753667,20200704,5360515|5480230|9804952|44365777,103171149|103394215|103698780|131283791,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9857089,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

Of the two bivalent ligands (1,2) synthesized, only 1 had substantially greater antinociceptive potency in mice than its monovalent analogues (1a, 1b). Testing of 1, 1a, and 1b in the guinea pig ileum preparation (GPI) revealed a potency profile similar to that found in vivo, whereas no correlation was observed in the mouse vas deferens (MVD). Binding data indicated the same rank-order affinities at delta receptors as the opioid activities in the GPI and in mice. However, mu binding exhibited no relationship with activity.

Conformational constraint in the 'address' sequence._||_Abstract: Several cyclic lactam analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 were prepared in order to reduce the conformational flexibility in different regions of the native linear peptide. Cyclo[D-Asp(i),Dap(i+3)]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 (Dap = alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid) analogues were designed on the basis of molecular modeling using AMBER, which suggested that this constraint may be compatible with an alpha-helix. The cyclic portion of these constrained analogues spanned from residues 3 to 9, a region proposed by Schwyzer (Biochemistry 1986, 25, 4281) to adopt a helical conformation at kappa receptor sites. Analogues containing Dab (alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid) or Orn in position i + 3 were also synthesized to examine the effects of larger ring size. The cyclic peptides exhibited marked differences in binding affinities for kappa, mu, and delta receptors and in opioid activity in the guinea pig ileum (GPI). Cyclo[D-Asp6,Dap9]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 showed both high kappa receptor affinity and potent agonist activity in the GPI, while cyclo[D-Asp3,Dap6]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 exhibited very weak binding affinity at all opioid receptors as well as very weak opioid activity in the GPI. Cyclo[D-Asp5,Dap8]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 showed moderate binding affinity for kappa receptors and was the most kappa selective ligand in this study, but this peptide exhibited very weak agonist activity in the GPI assay. Compared to the corresponding linear peptides, all of the cyclic peptides exhibited decreased mu receptor affinity, while kappa receptor affinity was retained or improved. Therefore the corresponding linear peptides were generally mu selective while the cyclic constrained peptides demonstrated slight selectivity for kappa vs mu receptors or were nonselective. Increasing the ring size by incorporating Dab or Orn in positions 6, 8, or 9 did not significantly affect the binding affinity for the three opioid receptor types nor the opioid activity observed in the GPI. Circular dichroism spectra of the cyclo[D-Asp(i),Dap(i+3)] derivatives in 80% trifluoroethanol at 25 and 5 degrees C suggested differences in the stability of a helical structure when the constraint was incorporated near the N-terminus vs in the middle of the peptide.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753763,20181015,25075996|44272933|44272934|44273019|44273020|44273021|44273048|44273049|44273050|44273081|44273082|73356166,103185275|103185276|103185463|103185464|103185465|103185513|103185514|103185515|103185566|103185567|103566017|174520919,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9111295,0,NULL,P41143,10141,197,,NULL

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754168,20181015,44297100|44297195,103238133|103238445,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

This approach envisaged the delta opioid receptor to contain two major recognition subsites; a message subsite which recognizes the pharmacophore, and an address subsite that is unique for the delta receptor type and confers selectivity. The message and address components of the delta-selective enkephalins were postulated to be Tyr1 and Phe4, respectively, with Gly2-Gly3 functioning as a spacer. The message component of the target compounds in this study was derived from naltrexone and related structures. An indole system was fused to the C ring of naltrexone as a mimic of the address component. The benzene moiety of indole was viewed as the delta address component, mimicking the phenyl group of Phe4, and the pyrrole portion was used as a rigid spacer. Members of the series (1-23) were evaluated for opioid antagonist activity on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. Naltrindole (NTI, 1) was the most potent member of the series, with Ke values of approximately 0.1 nM at delta receptors. The antagonism by NTI was approximately 220- and 350-fold greater at delta than at mu and kappa opioid receptors. The binding of NTI and selected members of the series to guinea pig brain membranes was qualitatively consistent with their pharmacologic antagonist activity profiles in the MVD and GPI, but the Ki values were not in the same rank order. The selectivity of NTI arises mainly as a consequence of increased affinity at delta receptors. Thus, the Ke and Ki values of NTI were 1/530 and 1/90 that of the delta antagonist enkephalin analogue, ICI 174864. In contrast to NTI, ICI174864 derives its selectivity through greatly decreased recognition at mu and kappa receptors.

A hydrazone group was employed as a linkage between the alkaloids and peptides. The binding data for mu, kappa, and delta receptors indicate that peptide portions of the analogues can modulate the receptor selectivity of the attached alkaloid pharmacophores. The selectivity for different opioid receptor types depends on a balance between the affinities of the message and address components. In cases where these components have comparable receptor affinities, the address can significantly shift selectivity by increasing affinity to one receptor type while reducing affinity to other types. When the message component has high affinity for a particular receptor type, the modulatory role of the address is expressed mainly by reducing the affinity of the ligand for other opioid receptor types.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758770,20181011,461776|5284604|5360515|44273477|49860168|49860169|49860170|56674946|90663908|90663910,103166802|103186355|103250876|104234924|104234926|104234927|131283791|134453407|242583867|242583868,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2879914,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

Effects on opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity were determined. The results, which are generally consistent with reports of analogous modifications in linear and cyclic pentapeptide enkephalins, indicate that steric, lipophilic, and electronic properties are all important determinants of delta opioid receptor recognition. Specifically, modifications which increase lipophilicity or exert electron-withdrawing effects on the aromatic ring enhance binding affinity, while hydrophilic, bulky, or electron-releasing modifications are detrimental.

The other two monomers, which included N-substituted or unsubstituted Boc-protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity.

Additional structure-activity relationship studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen-bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. These sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-fold increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu-selective ligand, (+)-N-[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a).

Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756033,20181015,5497186|44353390|44353391|44353454|44353457|44353458|44353468,103365942|103365943|103366138|103366152|103366153|103366185|103697951,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

It was shown that high-affinity, fully efficacious, and delta opioid receptor-selective compounds can be obtained from this transposition. In addition to the N,N-diethylamido group needed as the delta address, the structural features identified to promote delta receptor affinity in the set of compounds studied included a cis relative stereochemistry between the 3- and 4-substituents in the piperidine ring, a trans-crotyl or allyl substituent on the basic nitrogen, the lack of a 2-methyl group in the piperidine ring, and either no substitution or hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring not substituted with the N,N-diethylamido group. Structural features found to be important for mu affinity include hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring, the presence of a 2-methyl group in a cis relative relationship to the 4-amino group as well as N-substituents such as cyclopropylmethyl. It was also determined that mu receptor affinity could be increased while maintaining delta receptor affinity, especially when hydroxyl-substituted compounds are considered. Additionally, it was discovered that the somewhat lower mu/delta selectivities observed for the piperidine compounds relative to the piperazine-based ligands appear to arise as a consequence of the carbon-nitrogen transposition which imparts an overall lower delta and higher mu affinity to the piperidine-based ligands. This higher affinity for the mu receptor, apparently intrinsic to the piperidine-based compounds, suggests that ligands of this class will more easily be converted to mu/delta combination agonists compared to the piperazine ligands such as 1. This is particularly important since analogues of 1, which show both mu- and delta-type activity, are now recognized as important for their strong analgesia and cross-canceling of many of the side effects found in agonists operating exclusively from either the delta or mu opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756035,20181017,10431414|71450906,103191930|163315976,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11300879,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

By utilizing this natural product as a lead compound, synthesis of some derivatives, evaluations of the structure-activity relationship, and surveys of the intrinsic activities and potencies on opioid receptors were performed with guinea pig ileum. The affinities of some compounds for mu-, delta-, and kappa-receptors were determined in a receptor binding assay. The essential structural moieties in the Corynanthe type indole alkaloids for inducing the opioid agonistic activity were also clarified. The oxidative derivatives of mitragynine, i.e., mitragynine pseudoindoxyl (2) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (12), were found as opioid agonists with higher potency than morphine in the experiment with guinea pig ileum.

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance. These results indicate that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan templates could provide ligands with mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist profiles and such ligands may have the potential of emerging as novel analgesic drugs devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756039,20181018,10389163|10619541|11190061,103396470|103734666|103734938,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14998329,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

A specific class of thioureas bearing basic pyrrolidine residues were shown to give good binding affinities.

To overcome this limitation, we enhanced the hydrophobicity while maintaining the aqueous solubility properties in a class of opioid-mimetic substances by inclusion of two identical N-termini consisting of Dmt (2',6'-dimethyl-l-tyrosine) coupled to a pyrazinone ring platform by means of alkyl chains to yield the class of 3,6-bis[Dmt-NH-(CH(2))(n)]-2(1H)-pyrazinones. These compounds displayed high micro-opioid receptor affinity (K(i)micro = 0.042-0.115 nM) and selectivity (K(i)delta/K(i)micro = 204-307) and functional micro-opioid receptor agonism (guinea-pig ileum, IC(50) = 1.3-1.9 nM) with little or undetectable bioactivity toward delta-opioid receptors (mouse vas deferens) and produced analgesia in mice in a naloxone reversible manner when administered centrally (intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) or systemically (subcutaneously and orally). Furthermore, the most potent compound, 3,6-bis(3'-Dmt-aminopropyl)-5-methyl-2(1H)-pyrazinone (7'), lacked functional delta-opioid receptor bioactivity and was 50-63-fold and 18-21-fold more active than morphine by icv administration as measured analgesia using tail-flick (spinal involvement) and hot-plate (supraspinal effect) tests, respectively; the compound ranged from 16 to 63% as potent upon systemic injection. These analgesic effects are many times greater than unmodified opioid peptides. The data open new possibilities for the rational design of potential opioid-mimetic drugs that pass through the epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract and the blood-brain barrier to target brain receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL883419,20181001,90665145,242612234,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15115401,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Absolute configuration and analgetic potency of beta-1,2-dimethyl-2-phenyl-4-(propionyloxy)piperidine enantiomers._||_Abstract: Enantiomers of beta-1,2-dimethyl-4-phenyl-4-(propionyloxy)piperidine (4) were employed as probes to demonstrate that opioid receptors are capable of distinguishing between the enantiotopic edges (the Ogston effect) of the piperidine ring. These enantiomers, (-)- and (+)-4.HCl, were prepared by esterification of the corresponding alcohols, (+)- and (-)-4a. Single crystal X-ray studies of (-)-4a.HCl reveal that it possesses the 2R,4S absolute configuration. Analgetic testing in mice (hot-plate) and receptor binding studies indicate that (-)-(2S,4R)-4.HCl is approximately ten times more potent than its enantiomer. The results are consistent with the operation of the Ogston effect in the interaction of achiral 4-phenylpiperidines with opioid receptors. Additionally, it is suggested that the piperidine ring of these and other closely related 4-phenylpiperidines bind within a receptor subsite cleft whose dimensions exclude diequatorial 2,6- and 3,5-dimethyl-substituted ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755152,20181002,4741130|6542471|44272414,103184211|103184536|160686191,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,6283082,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

The analgesic activities of the compounds were determined in mice. Opiate receptor binding studies, in the presence and absence of sodium ion, were carried out. The antagonist activities of normetazocine derivatives were studied in monkeys. These were further examined in the isolated guinea pig ileum for relative agonist activity. The pKa values were measured; in vivo agonist acitivty was lost with weakly basic derivatives. For the normetazocine derivatives, opiate receptor binding data were consistent with guinea pig ileum agonist potency and mouse vas deferens antagonist potency but not with in vivo data. Opiate receptor binding was reduced for the less basic normetazocine derivatives. In the normeperidine series, there was no apparent direct relationship between pKa and opiate receptor binding. However, a relationship involving the hydrophobic character of the N-substituent is discussed. The N-(2-fluoroethyl) derivatives in both series were found to cause convulsions in rats at doses of 40-45 mg/kg ip.

These agents were prepared to obtain electrophilic opioid ligands potentially useful in the characterization of opioid receptors and drug-receptor interactions. Preparation of these ligands was accomplished from 3-O-trityl-6 beta-naltrexol (13) via phase transfer-catalyzed alkylation of the regioisomeric o-, m-, and p-nitrobenzyl halides and the o-, m-, and p-cyanobenzyl halides. The intermediates were deprotected and reduced, and formation of the isothiocyanates from the corresponding amines completed the synthesis. The ligands (6-11) were tested in radioligand displacement assays in guinea pig brain homogenate for opioid receptor binding affinity and irreversibility. All six of the isothiocyanates demonstrated significant affinity in the displacement assays for all three opioid receptors. They also appeared to be irreversibly bound at each of the receptor types. Compound 6, the o-isothiocyanatobenzyl ether analog, had the highest affinity, and it demonstrated significant irreversibility at very low concentration.

Stepwise removal of the C-terminal residues from this ligand demonstrated that its positively charged Arg residues, particularly Arg6 and Arg7, were crucial for binding to the kappa receptor. Analogues shorter than seven amino acids lacked significant affinity for opioid receptors. Comparison with a series of truncated analogues of Dyn A showed that the relative losses in binding potency differed only slightly between the two series. The neutral residues Ile8 and Pro10 could be removed without significant loss in affinity for the kappa receptor. Their replacement, in the Pro3 analogue, with additional Arg residues led to analogues with improved kappa affinity (e.g., [Pro3,Arg8]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 20: K(i)(kappa) = 0.44 nM). This type of modification did not compromise the high kappa selectivity of the Pro3 analogues. These findings support the view that a negatively charged domain in the putative second extracellular loop of the kappa receptor selectively recognizes residues 6-11 of dynorphin through electrostatic interactions. As with parent compound 2, analogue 20 and related compounds displayed kappa antagonist properties.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754235,20181017,73346891,174489922,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12747782,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,10141,NULL,,NULL

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively).

Several of these Dyn A analogs exhibit unexpected apparent selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogs has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [L-Pen5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (4), [Cys5,Cys10]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (5), [Cys5,Cys9]DynA1-11-NH2 (6), and [Cys4,Cys9,Arg10]DynA1-11-NH2(7). All of these analogs possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities for the central receptor (guinea pig brain), but effect only weak potency at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (GPI). In fact cyclic dynorphin A analog 4 shows > 19,000-fold differences between central kappa opioid affinity and potency in the guinea pig ileum (GPI). Additionally analog 4 is not an antagonist in the GPI, suggesting possible receptor differences between these sites. Substitution of Tyr1 by Phe1 in the cyclic 1-11 series gave the analog [Phe1,Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) that was surprisingly potent in the guinea pig brain binding assay (IC50 = 15.1 nM) at the kappa receptor, but was inactive in the GPI and mouse vas deferens bioassays. D-Ala2 and Tic4 analogs of 1 had lower affinity at brain kappa receptors and had very weak potencies in the GPI and MVD bioassays.

Among the beta-naltrexamine derivatives 1-7, all displayed partial agonism on the guinea pig ileal longitudinal muscle preparation except for aspartyl derivative 6, which was a full agonist with activity in the range of morphine. The beta-oxymorphamine derivatives 8-12 were all full agonists with potencies ranging from 1.5 to 6.1 times that of morphine. Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

The L- and D-Homophe4 (homophenylalanine) analogues of [D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 were compared to the (R)- and (S)-Atc4 (2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid) derivatives (Aldrich et al.

[l-Homophe4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the D-Homophe4 isomer, while [(R)-Atc4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the (S)-Atc4 isomer. Comparing the structure of Atc to those of Phe and Homophe, these results suggest that the Atc isomers are functioning more as constrained Homophe rather than Phe analogues in these Dyn A derivatives. The higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity of the (R)-Atc4 analogue suggests that Phe4 of Dyn A most likely adopts a gauche (-) or trans conformation in the kappa-opioid receptor binding site.

Most of the analogues in this series showed much lower affinity for delta-opioid receptors than the parent peptide, suggesting that kappa- and delta-opioid receptors have distinct binding pockets for the residue at position 4 of Dyn A.

All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000.

The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective.

A change in chirality of Dmt at C alpha (1, 2, 6, 8, 10, 13) curtailed delta receptor parameters, while replacement of its alpha-amino function by a methyl group (3) led to inactivity; Tyr-Tic analogues 4 and 11 weakly interacted with delta receptors. N-Alkylation of H-Dmt-Tic-OH and H-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH with methyl groups produced potent delta-opioid ligands with high delta receptor binding capabilities and enhanced delta antagonism: (i) N-Me-Dmt-Tic-OH 5 had high delta opioid binding (Ki delta = 0.2 nM), elevated delta antagonism on mouse vas deferens (MVD) (pA2 = 8.5; Ke = 2.8 nM), and nondetectable mu activity with guinea pig ileum (GPI). (ii) N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) was equally efficacious in delta receptor binding (Ki delta = 0.12 nM; Ki mu/Ki delta = 20000), but delta antagonism rose considerably (pA2 = 9.4; Ke = 0.28 nM) with weak mu antagonism (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:5640). N-Me-(9) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) also augmented delta opioid receptor binding, such that 15 demonstrated high affinity (Ki delta = 0.0755 nM) and selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 20132) with exceptional antagonist activity on MVD (pA2 = 9.6; Ke = 0.22 nM) and weak antagonism on GPI (pA2 = 5.8; Ke = 1.58 microM; GPI/MVD = 1:7180). Although the amidated dimethylated dipeptide analogue 14 had high Ki delta (0.31 nM) and excellent antagonist activity (pA2 = 9.9; Ke = 0.12 nM), the increased activity toward mu receptors in the absence of a free acid function at the C-terminus revealed modest delta selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta = 1655) and somewhat comparable bioactivity (GPI/MVD = 4500). Thus, the data demonstrate that N,N-(Me)2-Dmt-Tic-OH (12) and N,N-Me2-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH (15) retained high delta receptor affinities and delta selectivities and acquired enhanced potency in pharmacological bioassays on MVD greater than that of other peptide or non-peptide delta antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844631,20200704,5497186|10596072|10668458|15384271|44336001|44336032|44336081|44336096|73351569|73353034|73353035|73355833,103324449|103324528|103324574|103324599|103324678|103324699|103697951|103700766|174505469|174510599|174510600|174520363,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9301674,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

These results indicate that a positively charged N-terminal amino group may be essential for signal transduction but not for receptor binding and suggested that its deletion in agonist opioid peptides containing an N-terminal 2',6'-dimethyltyrosine (Dmt) residue may represent a general way to convert them into antagonists. In an attempt to develop dynorphin A (Dyn A)-derived kappa opioid antagonists, we prepared analogues of [Dmt(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1), in which the N-terminal amino group was either omitted or replaced with a methyl group. This was achieved by replacement of Tyr(1) with 3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid (Dhp) or (2S)-2-methyl-3-(2,6-dimethyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid [(2S)-Mdp]. Compounds were tested in the guinea pig ileum and mouse vas deferens bioassays and in rat and guinea pig brain membrane receptor binding assays.

However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852599,20200628,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73346658|73347231|73350321|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174489529|174490340|174500605|174505789|174510939,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The role of steric hindrance in conferring selectivity._||_Abstract: A series of 2',3'-disubstituted pyrrolomorphinans (5a-i) were synthesized to determine the role of steric hindrance at mu and kappa receptors in promoting delta opioid receptor antagonist selectivity. In smooth muscle preparations, five members of the series (5a-c,e,f) possessed Ke values in the range 2-15 nM and were delta selective. Since the unsubstituted analogue 4 possessed delta antagonist potency of similar magnitude, but was not delta selective, it is suggested that the 2',3'-substitution confers delta selectivity by hindering the interaction of the pharmacophore at mu and kappa receptors, while not affecting delta receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL848822,20200704,5497186|44302610|44302643|44302652|44302653,103250407|103250450|103250465|103250466|103697951,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9207938,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors. The cis-ACCA analogue showed very weak opioid activity (IC50 = 4.0 microM) in the guinea pig ileum.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL840919,20200703,25079852,103173862,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097539,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Hydrophilic groups as determinants of selective antagonism of delta 1 opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in mice._||_Abstract: A series of amino acid conjugates (2-6) of naltrindole (1) were synthesized from 7'-carboxynaltrindole (7) in order to obtain delta antagonists that would have minimal access to the central nervous system (CNS) upon peripheral administration. All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852828,20200703,44353390|44353391|44353454|44353457|44353458|44353468,103365942|103365943|103366138|103366152|103366153|103366185,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The corresponding acetamide derivatives (5-7) also were synthesized to serve as nonelectrophilic controls. The o- and p-isothiocyanates (2 and 4) and the haloamides (8-11) were selective delta opioid receptor antagonists in the mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, while the meta isomer 3 was a delta-selective full agonist (IC50 = 5 nM). The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component. The m-isothiocyanate 3 was found to be a delta-selective and irreversible agonist in the MVD, and it is suggested that it may be covalently binding to an agonist recognition site. In the mouse abdominal stretch antinociceptive assay, compounds 2-4 and 9 were delta-selective antagonists but exhibited delta 2/delta 1 selectivity ratios than that of BNTI.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL840955,20200704,44276213|44276269|44276292|44276293|44276334,103196586|103196719|103196790|103196791|103196920,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7731019,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Compounds 4-16 were evaluated for their affinities in opioid receptor binding assays in rat or guinea pig brain membranes and for their opioid antagonist and agonist activities in vitro on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. All of the compounds displayed delta selectivity in binding to the delta, mu, and kappa opioid receptors. The binding potencies of most of the compounds at the delta, mu, and kappa sites, however, were lower than that of 1. Among positional isomers, the 7'-substituted compounds in general had higher affinities than 6'-, 5'-, or 4'-substituted analogues, indicating that bulky groups are tolerated better at the 7'-position than at other positions. The affinity of the compounds were also determined at putative subtypes of the delta and kappa receptors: deltacx-1 (mu-like), deltacx-2 (delta-like), and the kappa2b site in an attempt to identify subtype selective agents. Although none were identified, the data revealed a different rank-order of potency beteween mu vs deltacx-1, deltacx-2 vs delta, and the kappa2b vs mu, delta, and kappa1. The antagonist potencies of the compounds in the MVD were in agreement with their binding affinities at the delta site in rat brain membrane. The most potent member of the series, the 7'-phenoxy compound 14, binds to the delta site with a Ki of 0.71 nM, shows >40-fold delta over mu and delta over kappa binding selectivity, and exhibits delta receptor antagonist potency in the MVD with a Ke of 0.25 nM, properties which are comparable to the delta receptor affinity and antagonist potency of naltrindole (Ki = 0.29 nM, Ke = 0. 49 nM). Interestingly, many members of the series were found to possess significant partial to full agonist activities in the MVD (6, 9, 10, 13, 16) or GPI (6, 11, 14, 15). Among the compounds studied, the highest agonist activity in the MVD was displayed by 16 (IC50 = 220 nM), and the highest agonist activity in the GPI was displayed by 14 (IC50 = 450 nM). The overall affinity and activity profile of compound 14 is, therefore, that of a nonpeptide ligand possessing mixed mu agonist/delta antagonist properties. Recently there has been considerable interest in such compounds possessing mu agonist/delta antagonist activities because of their potential therapeutic usefulness as analgesics with low propensity to produce tolerance and dependence side effects. The results of the present study suggest that morphinan derivatives related to 16 and 14 may provide useful leads for the development of potent nonpeptide ligands possessing delta agonist or mixed delta antagonist/mu agonist activities.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL841115,20200704,5497186|44329399|44329448|44329452|44329460|44329469|44329553,103311925|103312035|103312041|103312058|103312071|103312228|103697951,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9667975,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

CCK may be upregulated in conditions of chronic pain or during sustained morphine administration resulting in attenuation of opioid-mediated pain relief. These complex interactions between opioids and endogenous CCK receptor systems have suggested the need for a new paradigm in drug design for some states of chronic pain. In these circumstances the rational design of potential drugs for the treatment of these conditions must be based on one ligand for multiple targets. We have designed a single peptide which can interact with delta and mu opioid receptors as agonists and with CCK receptors as antagonists. The ligands were designed based on a model of overlapping pharmacophores of opioid and CCK peptide ligands, which incorporates opioid pharmacophores at the N-terminal and CCK tetrapeptide pharmacophores at the C-terminal of the designed ligands. We measured binding and activities of our bifunctional peptides at opioid and CCK receptors.

CCK may be upregulated in conditions of chronic pain or during sustained morphine administration resulting in attenuation of opioid-mediated pain relief. These complex interactions between opioids and endogenous CCK receptor systems have suggested the need for a new paradigm in drug design for some states of chronic pain. In these circumstances the rational design of potential drugs for the treatment of these conditions must be based on one ligand for multiple targets. We have designed a single peptide which can interact with delta and mu opioid receptors as agonists and with CCK receptors as antagonists. The ligands were designed based on a model of overlapping pharmacophores of opioid and CCK peptide ligands, which incorporates opioid pharmacophores at the N-terminal and CCK tetrapeptide pharmacophores at the C-terminal of the designed ligands. We measured binding and activities of our bifunctional peptides at opioid and CCK receptors. Compound 11 (Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-d-Trp-NMeNle-Asp-Phe-NH(2)) demonstrated opioid agonist properties at delta and mu receptors (IC(50) = 63 +/- 27 nM and 150 +/- 65 nM, respectively in MVD and GPI tissue assays) and high binding affinity at CCK-1 and CCK-2 receptors (K(i) = 320 and 1.5 nM, respectively).

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process. We believe that this is one of the first examples for a Phase III drug candidate that was discovered and optimized, from start to finish, using in silico model-based methods as the primary tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL862261,20181020,9851104|11430856,103488450|103570372,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16722631,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Recently, it has been successfully used in peptide chemistry for obtaining cyclic molecules bridged through an olefin unit in place of the usual disulfide bond. Here, we describe this approach for obtaining cyclic olefin bridged analogues of H-Tyr-c[D-Cys-Gly-Phe-Cys]-OH. The synthesis of the new ligands was performed using the second generation Grubbs' catalyst.

Also the linear precursor 13 (lDADAE) and the hydrogenated derivative 11 (rDADAE) also were tested.

In this concept, the bifunctional peptides were expected to interact with each receptor separately in the spinal dorsal horn where both the opioid receptors and the NK1 receptors were found to be expressed, to show an enhanced analgesic effect, no opioid-induced tolerance, and to provide better compliance than coadministration of two drugs. Compounds were synthesized using a two-step combinatorial method for C-terminal modification. In the method, the protected C-terminal-free carboxyl peptide, Boc-Tyr( tBu)- d-Ala-Gly Phe-Pro-Leu-Trp(Boc)-OH, was synthesized as a shared intermediate using Fmoc solid phase chemistry on a 2-chlorotrityl resin. This intermediate was esterified or amidated in solution phase. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) showed that the C-terminus acted as not only a critical pharmacophore for the substance P antagonist activities, but as an address region for the opioid agonist pharmacophore that is structurally distant from the C-terminal. Among the peptides, H-Tyr- d -Ala-Gly-Phe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bzl ( 3) demonstrated high binding affinities at both delta and mu receptors ( K i = 10 and 0.65 nM, respectively) with efficient agonist functional activity in the mouse isolated vas deferens (MVD) and guinea pig isolated ileum (GPI) assays (IC 50 = 50 and 13 nM, respectively).

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1017472,20181024,5284596,103170037,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970719,20181026,44299404,103243877,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

The b-isomers were very difficult to synthesize because of the highly strained 5,6-trans-fused ring junction that had to be formed. Our successful strategy required functionalization of the position para (or ortho) to a fluorine atom on the aromatic ring using an electron-withdrawing nitro group to activate that fluorine. The racemic N-phenethyl analogues 24 and 16 were moderately potent kappa-receptor antagonists in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay.

A variety of novel piperidine MDL 100907 derivatives, possible to label with (18)F-fluorine, were synthesized to improve molecular imaging properties of [(11)C]MDL 100907. Their in vitro affinities to a broad spectrum of neuroreceptors and their lipophilicities were determined and compared to the clinically used reference compounds MDL 100907 and altanserin.

The opiates 6beta-naltrexol and 6beta-naltrexamide function as neutral antagonists in in vitro and in vivo systems previously exposed to morphine, and are under investigation as improved treatments for narcotic dependence. In this research, we synthesized and characterized carbamate and sulfonate ester derivates of 6beta-naltrexol that do not contain a protic group at C(6), and evaluated these compounds for opioid receptor affinity. In vitro receptor subtype (mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors) binding data of the carbamate and sulfonate derivatives is reported. All four compounds synthesized exhibited affinity for the MOR better than the standard 6beta-naltrexol HCl. Based on K(i) data, the order of MOR affinity is as follows: 9>13>14>10>6beta-naltrexol HCl. Carbamate 9 and tosylate 13 displayed subnanomolar affinity for the MOR, while 10 was the most mu-selective compound synthesized. In conclusion, our data indicate that the absence of a hydrogen-bond donor on the C(6) oxygen enhances rather than impedes the in vitro affinity of naltrexol derivatives for the MOR.

Historically, many of these drugs have multiple mechanisms of action including calcium and sodium channel blockade as well as GABAergic activity and thus a number of associated side effects. Modulation of the M-current through opening of KCNQ channels has been proposed as a way to attenuate neuroexcitability and have a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of seizure disorders. Therefore, as part of our program to identify new treatments for epilepsy, we set out to identify agonists of KCNQ channels.

As a consequence of these efforts, it is known today that several compounds from different structural groups and with different mechanisms of action seem to be responsible for the observed antidepressant efficacy of St. John's Wort. Co-effectors in the extract improve the bioavailability of active constituents such as hypericin (1) (pharmacokinetic synergy). Unwanted side effects are preventable without remarkable loss of activity when the responsible constituent(s) are carefully removed during the extraction process, as demonstrated for hyperforin (3), which is responsible for the induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP)-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, in particular).

These modifications were made mainly on the aryl side of the ester bond to permit possible rapid labeling of the carboxylic acid component with a positron emitter, either carbon-11 (t(1/2) = 20.4 min) or fluorine-18 (t(1/2) = 109.7 min), and included (i) replacement of the iodine atom with a small substituent such as nitrile, methyl, or fluoro, (ii) methylation of the 8-amino group, (iii) opening of the dioxan ring, and (iv) alteration of the length of the N-alkyl goup. High-affinity ligands were discovered for recombinant human 5-HT(4) receptors with amenability to labeling with a positron emitter and potential for development as imaging probes. The ring-opened radioligand, (([methoxy-(11)C]1-butylpiperidin-4-yl)methyl 4-amino-3-methoxybenzoate; [(11)C]13), showed an especially favorable array of properties for future evaluation as a PET radioligand for brain 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1259781,20180915,49783209|49783415|49783419,123087255|123089475|123092024,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20812727,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The secondary amine 10 represents the central building block for the synthesis of more than 25 tetrahydro-3-benzazepin-1-ols. Generally 7-hydroxy derivatives display higher NR2B receptor affinities than the corresponding 7-benzyloxy compounds. A distance of four atoms (five bond lengths) between the basic amino group and the terminal aryl moiety led to highest NR2B affinity. 3-(4-Phenylbutyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (WMS-1410, 25) represents the most promising NR2B antagonist of this series showing a K(i)-value of 14nM. Compound 25 reveals excellent selectivity over more than 100 further relevant target proteins, antagonizes glutamate induced excitotoxicity (IC(50)=18.4nM) and is metabolically more stable than ifenprodil.

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets.

The novel ligands are formed by two modified JTC-801 units linked by di-iminic and di-aminic spacers with length ranging from three to ten methylene units. Moreover, the synthesis and the pharmacological characterization were extended to the corresponding univalent ligands. The latter compounds consisted in a single modified JTC-801 unit and an alkyl or alkylamino or alkylimino tail. The purpose of this study is to feature the location and surroundings of the allosteric binding site(s) of pharmacophores containing the 4-aminoquinoline structure. Most important, the bivalent ligands were exploited to reveal the eventual occurrence of a supramolecular receptorial architecture of the NOPr. All the bivalent derivatives 4 and 5 proved to be active in the nanomolar range with no outstanding dependence on the chain length. They showed potencies from three to ten times higher than the corresponding monomers. Consequently, results clearly indicated a positive role of the second pharmacophore in the ligand-protein interaction. The pharmacological profile of the monomers 7 and 8 clarified the contribution of the linker chain to NOP receptor affinity and suggested the presence of a lipophilic acidic site neighbouring the binding site of the JTC-like ligands. Selectivity of saturated compounds 5, 7, and 8 was tested by binding experiments on δ, κ and μ opioid receptors. Results indicated a general loss of selectivity as compared to JTC-801. In the [(35)S]GTPγS binding assay, all the compounds revealed antagonistic properties at the NOP Receptor.

Particularly, the mu opioid receptor selectivity over kappa opioid receptor of NGP was considerably enhanced compared to that of NAP.

Several of the synthesized peptides were determined to be high affinity agonists for the μ opioid receptor (OPRM) with selectivity over the δ opioid receptor (OPRD). Interesting effects of the Aba configuration on ligand binding affinity were observed. H-Dmt-d-Ala-erythro-(4S,5S)-5-Me-Aba-Gly-NH(2)9 and H-Dmt-threo-(4R,5S)-5-Me-Aba-Gly-NH(2)12 exhibited subnanomolar affinity for OPRM, while they possess an opposite absolute configuration at position 4 of the Aba ring.

642501,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to delta opioid receptor,"Title: Synthesis, radiofluorination and pharmacological evaluation of a fluoromethyl spirocyclic PET tracer for central σ1 receptors and comparison with fluoroalkyl homologs._||_Abstract: The spirocyclic σ(1) receptor ligand 1 (1'-benzyl-3-(fluoromethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]) was prepared in four steps starting from methoxy derivative 5. Due to its high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.74nM) and selectivity against several other relevant targets, 1 was investigated as (18)F-labeled PET tracer and its biological properties were compared with those of homologous fluoroalkyl derivatives 2-4. The fluoromethyl derivative 1 was faster metabolized in vitro than homologs 2-4. In contrast to the radiosynthesis of [(18)F]2-4, the nucleophilic substitution of the tosylate 15 using the K[(18)F]F-K(222)-carbonate complex required heating to 150°C in DMSO to achieve high labeling efficiencies. Whereas radiometabolites of [(18)F]2-4 were not detected in vivo in the brain of mice, two radiometabolites of [(18)F]1 were found. Analysis of ex vivo autoradiography images provided rather low target-to-nontarget ratio for [(18)F]1 compared with [(18)F]2-4. [(18)F]1 showed a fast uptake in the brain, which decreased continuously over time. The brain-to-plasma ratio of the radiotracer [(18)F]1 was only exceeded by the fluoroethyl tracer [(18)F]2.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1941655,20200626,44474938|50994498|56840667|57402462,103697992|124958368|136930451|136943461,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22136765,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Synthesis of an N-substituted 4-hydroxy-5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)morphan with high affinity and selective μ-antagonist activity._||_Abstract: A simple three-step synthesis of 5-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-2-methyl-2-azabicyclo[3.3.1]nonan-4-ol (3a) was achieved using an osmium tetroxide mediated oxidation of the known intermediate 6. A pyrrolidine-ring variant of 3a (3-(7-(hydroxymethyl)-6-methyl-6-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octan-1-yl)phenol (5)) was isolated when other routes were used. The epimeric hydroxy analogue 4a was synthesized by simple inversion of the stereochemistry at C-4. Both N-methyl (3a and 4a) and N-phenethyl (3b and 4b) derivatives were synthesized. The compounds were examined for their opioid receptor affinity and the N-phenethyl analogue 3b was found to have relatively weak affinity for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 74 nM). However, the N-phenethyl analogue of the C-4 epimer, 4b, had about 15 fold higher affinity than 3b and was selective for the μ-opioid receptor (K(i) = 4.6 nM). Compound 4b was a moderately potent μ-opioid antagonist (K(e) = 12 nM), as determined by [(35)S]GTP-γ-S assays. Compounds 3b and 4b were energy minimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G*, and then overlaid onto the 5-phenylmorphan, the (1R,5R,9S)-(-)-enantiomer of 2b (Fig. 1) with the α or β-OH group at the C-9 position. The spatial orientation of the hydroxyl moiety in 3b, 4b, 2a, and 2b is proposed to be the structural requirement for high μ-opioid receptor binding affinity and their agonist or antagonist activity. The modest change in spatial position of the hydroxyl moiety, and not the N-substituent, induced the change from potent agonist to an antagonist of moderate potency.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1955136,20200626,105104|5288826|5462471|57391716|57393448|57395174|57396943|57396944|57402172,103169185|103177815|103217856|136923502|136926723|136929908|136933179|136933180|136942933,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22341895,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

Conversion of the furan ring to an aldehyde at the C-12 position (5) has allowed for the synthesis of analogues with new carbon-carbon bonds at that position. Previous methods for forming these bonds, such as Grignard and Stille conditions, have met with limited success. We report a palladium catalyzed Liebeskind-Srogl cross-coupling reaction of a thioester and a boronic acid that occurs at neutral pH and ambient temperature to produce ketone analogs at C-12. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported usage of the Liebeskind-Srogl reaction to diversify a natural product scaffold. We also describe a one-step protocol for the conversion of 1 to 12-epi-1 (3) through microwave irradiation. Previously, this synthetically challenging process has required multiple steps. Additionally, we report in this study that alkene 9 and aromatic analogues 12, 19, 23, 25, and 26 were discovered to retain affinity and selectivity at kappa opioid receptors (KOP). Finally, we report that the furan-2-yl analog of 1 (31) has similar affinity to 1. Collectively, these findings suggest that different aromatic groups appended directly to the decalin core may be well tolerated by KOP receptors, and may generate further ligands with affinity and activity at KOP receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026569,20180921,60150457|60150458|70681353|70683422|70685543|70687674|70689742|70691889|70696034,160667388|160667389|160672672|160678017|160683346|160688715|160688716|160694206|160704839,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22464684,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

However, their central administration led to the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Conjugation of C-terminal substance P (SP) fragments to opioids and opioid peptides was previously shown to produce hybrid peptides with strong analgesic activity, with low or no propensity to develop tolerance. In this study, four peptides (2-5) comprised of endomorphin-1 (1) and C-terminal fragments of SP (four or five amino acids, SP(8-11) (2) or SP(7-11) (4), respectively), with an overlapping Phe residue, were synthesized. To overcome low metabolic stability and poor membrane permeability of the peptide, the N-terminus of 2 and 4 was further modified with a C10-carbon lipoamino acid (C10LAA) achieving 3 and 5, respectively. LAA-modification of the hybrid peptides resulted in a significant increase in metabolic stability and membrane permeability compared to peptides 1, 2 and 4. Compound 5 showed potent μ-opioid receptor binding affinity (K(iμ)=3.87 ± 0.51 nM) with dose-dependent agonist activity in the nanomolar range (IC(50)=45 ± 13 nM). In silico modeling was used to investigate the binding modes and affinities of compounds 1-5 in the active site of μ-opioid receptors.

However, it now appears that biological diversity has evolved an alternative source. Specifically, at least two alkaloids isolated from the plant Mitragyna speciosa, mitragynine ((E)-2-[(2S,3S)-3-ethyl-8-methoxy-1,2,3,4,6,7,12,12b-octahydroindolo[3,2-h]quinolizin-2-yl]-3-methoxyprop-2-enoic acid methyl ester; 9-methoxy coryantheidine; MG) and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH-MG), and several synthetic analogues of these natural products display centrally mediated (supraspinal and spinal) antinociceptive (analgesic) activity in various pain models. Several characteristics of these compounds suggest a classic 'opioid' mechanism of action: nanomolar affinity for opioid receptors, competitive interaction with the opioid receptor antagonist naloxone, and two-way analgesic cross-tolerance with morphine. However, other characteristics of the compounds suggest novelty, particularly chemical structure and possible greater separation from side effects. We review the chemical and pharmacological properties of these compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399172,20180927,44301701,103248656,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23517479,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

We developed a method for preparing [(18)F]11 in useful radiochemical yield and in high specific activity from [(18)F]fluoride ion and an N-Boc-protected (phenyl)aryliodonium salt precursor (15). In baseline experiments in rhesus monkey, [(18)F]11 gave high brain radioactivity uptake, reflecting the expected distribution of mGluR1 with notably high uptake in cerebellum, which became 47% lower by 120 min after radioligand injection. Pharmacological challenges demonstrated that a very high proportion of the radioactivity in monkey brain was bound specifically and reversibly to mGluR1.

Recent studies demonstrated that compounds containing a biaryl-linked motif (Ar-X-Ar') modulate Na(+) currents. We, and others, have reported that compounds with an embedded benzyloxyphenyl unit (ArOCH2Ar', OCH2=X) exhibit potent anticonvulsant activities. Here, we show that benzyloxybenzylammonium chlorides ((+)H3NCH2C6H4OCH2Ar' Cl(-)) displayed notable activities in animal seizure models. Electrophysiological studies of 4-(2'-trifluoromethoxybenzyloxy)benzylammonium chloride (9) using embryonic cortical neurons demonstrated that 9 promoted both fast and slow inactivation of Na(+) channels. These findings suggest that the potent anticonvulsant activities of the earlier compounds were due, in part, to the benzyloxyphenyl motif and provide support for the use of the biaryl-linked pharmacophore in future drug design efforts.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3094844,20180928,23372523|47003377|72736159|72736161|72736163|75414421|76317227|76317228|76320939,194152381|194152382|194159323|194159324|194166328|194166329|194173164|194173165|194186818,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24238903,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The 17-substituent in KNT-127 derivatives exerted a great influence on the affinity and agonistic activity for the δ receptor. While the compounds with electron-donating 17-substituents showed higher affinities for the δ receptor than those with electron-withdrawing groups, KNT-127 derivatives with 17-fluoroalkyl groups (the high electron-withdrawing groups) showed high selectivities for the δ receptor among evaluated compounds. In addition, the basicity of nitrogen as well as the structure of the 17-N substituent such as the length and configuration at an asymmetric carbon atom contributed to agonist properties for the δ receptor. Thus, the analog with a 17-(3-ethoxypropyl) group showed the best selectively and potent agonistic activity for the δ receptor among KNT-127 derivatives.

In Part II of this series, we describe a continuing structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the NOP-selective piperidin-4-yl-1,3-dihydroindol-2-one scaffold, to obtain bifunctional activity at MOP, and a suitable ratio of NOP/MOP agonist activity that produces a non-addicting analgesic profile. The SAR reported here is focused on the influence of various piperidine nitrogen aromatic substituents on the ratio of binding affinity and intrinsic activity at both the NOP and MOP receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3270924,20181003,105104|5462471|16131448|22558157|86279209|90655970|90655971|90655972|90655973|90655974|90655975|90655976|90655977|90655978|90655979,103177815|103217856|103532611|242635767|242635768|242635769|242635770|242635771|242635772|242635773|242635774|242635775|242635776|242635777|242635778,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24657054,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285644,20200618,5748589|90678812|90678813,242640973|242640974|242640975,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

In vitro pharmacological characterization of representative compound 44 indicated agonist-PAM activity toward mGlu2 and PAM activity at mGlu3. The most potent mGlu2/3 PAMs were characterized in assays predictive of ADME/T and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, allowing the discovery of systemically active mGlu2/3 PAMs. On the basis of its overall profile, compound 74 was selected for behavioral studies and was shown to dose-dependently decrease cocaine self-administration in rats after intraperitoneal administration.

As an approach to reducing side effects associated with κ opioid agonists, a series of β-naltrexamides 3-10 was synthesized in an effort to selectively target putative κ opioid heteromers without recruiting β-arrestin upon activation. The most potent derivative 3 (INTA) strongly activated KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR heteromers in HEK293 cells. In vivo studies revealed 3 to produce potent antinociception, which, when taken together with antagonism data, was consistent with the activation of both heteromers. 3 was devoid of tolerance, dependence, and showed no aversive effect in the conditioned place preference assay. As immunofluorescence studies indicated no recruitment of β-arrestin2 to membranes in coexpressed KOR-DOR cells, this study suggests that targeting of specific putative heteromers has the potential to identify leads for analgesics devoid of adverse effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3370809,20200623,102340665|118709684|118709689|118709690,312351639|312351640|312351645|312351646,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24978316,0,NULL,P41143,9606,45,,NULL

The additional N atom of the quinoxaline system located outside the ethylenediamine κ pharmacophore allows the fine-tuning of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. The perhydroquinoxalines were synthesized stereoselectively using the concept of late stage diversification of the central building blocks 14. In addition to high κ-opioid receptor affinity they demonstrate high selectivity over μ, δ, σ1, σ2, and NMDA receptors. In the [35S]GTPγS assay full agonism was observed. Because of their high polarity, the secondary amines 14a (log D7.4=0.26) and 14b (log D7.4=0.21) did not penetrate an artificial blood-brain barrier. 14b was able to inhibit the spontaneous pain reaction after rectal mustard oil application to mice (ED50=2.35 mg/kg).

Selective introduction of the κ pharmacophoric structural elements pyrrolidine and 3,4-dichlorophenylacetamide with a two-carbon distance afforded conformationally restricted κ agonists 13-15 based on the quinoxaline ring system. In competitive radioligand receptor binding studies the benzylamine 13b, the secondary amine 14b, and the carbamate 15 displayed high κ receptor affinity. The Ki value of the lead compound derived methoxycarbonyl derivative 15 is 9.7nM. However, the κ affinity of 15 is exceeded by 13b and 14b with a basic functional group instead of the methoxycarbonyl group in 1-position of the quinoxaline system. The chlorine atoms of the dichlorophenylacetyl residue are essential, since the corresponding phenylacetyl analogs show considerably reduced κ affinity. The potent κ ligands 13b, 14b and 15 are selective over the related μ- and δ-opioid receptors, σ1, σ2 and NMDA receptors.

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues.

We synthesized diazaheterocyclics from reduced tripeptides. In vitro screening with radioligand competition binding assays demonstrated variable affinity for μ (MOR), δ (DOR), and κ (KOR) opioid receptors across the series, with the diimidazodiazepine 14 (2065-14) displaying good affinity for DOR and KOR.

These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

In this report we synthesized analogs of a general sequence Dmt-c[D-Lys-Xaa-Yaa-Asp]NH2, with D-1- or D-2-naphthyl-3-alanine (D-1-Nal or D-2-Nal) in positions 3 or 4. In our earlier papers we have indicated that replacing a phenylalanine residue by the more extended aromatic system of naphthylalanines may result in increased bioactivities of linear analogs. The data obtained here showed that only cyclopeptides modified in position 4 retained the sub-nanomolar MOR and nanomolar κ-opioid receptor (KOR) affinity, similar but not better than that of a parent cyclopeptide.

Of these, the C6-Me-(2-phenylethynyl) and C2-(5-chlorothienylethynyl) analogues were particularly potent, with human A3AR Ki values of 6 and 42 nM, respectively. Additionally, the C2-(5-chlorothienyl)-6-H analogue was potent and selective at A3AR (MRS7220, Ki 60 nM) and also completely reversed mouse sciatic nerve mechanoallodynia (in vivo, 3 μmol/kg, po). The lack of a C6 H-bond donor while maintaining A3AR affinity and efficacy could be rationalized by homology modeling and docking of these hypermodified nucleosides. The modeling suggests that a suitable combination of stabilizing features can partially compensate for the lack of an exocyclic amine, an otherwise important contributor to recognition in the A3AR binding site.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3803504,20200624,127047717,336900452,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26890707,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

Combination of 7 and NOP ligands (e.g., H-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) led to binding affinities in the low nanomolar domain. In vitro, the hybrids behaved as agonists at the opioid receptors and antagonists at the nociceptin receptor. Intravenous administration of hybrid 13a (H-Dmt-d-Arg-Aba-β-Ala-Arg-Tyr-Tyr-Arg-Ile-Lys-NH2) to mice resulted in potent and long lasting antinociception in the tail-flick test, indicating that 13a was able to permeate the BBB. This was further supported by a cell-based BBB model. All hybrids alleviated allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain models. Especially with respect to hyperalgesia, they showed to be more effective than the parent compounds. Hybrid 13a did not result in significant respiratory depression, in contrast to an equipotent analgesic dose of morphine. These hybrids hence represent a promising avenue toward analgesics for the dual treatment of acute and neuropathic pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3810904,20200624,101341769|118731120|122409965|127043001|127043364|127043559|127044528,312385060|336893551|336894039|336894287|336895782|336895818|336897110,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27035422,0,NULL,P41143,9606,45,,NULL

By revisiting this concept, and based on the structure of tramadol, we designed a series of novel compounds that act as highly potent and selective agonists of DOR among which (-)-6j showed the highest affinity (K i = 2.7 nM), best agonistic activity (EC50 = 2.6 nM), and DOR selectivity (more than 1000-fold over the other two subtype opioid receptors). Molecular docking studies suggest that the 'message' part of (-)-6j interacts with residue Asp128(3.32) and a neighboring water molecule, and the 'address' part of (-)-6j packs with hydrophobic residues Leu300(7.35), Val281(6.55), and Trp284(6.58), rendering DOR selectivity.

In previous studies we reported that compounds that did not have a hydroxyl on the 3-hydroxyphenyl group and did not have methyl groups at the 3- and 4-position of the piperidine ring were still potent and selective KOR antagonists. In this study we report JDTic analogs 2, 3a-b, 4a-b, and 5, where the 3-hydroxyphenyl ring has been replaced by a 2-, 3-, or 4-pyridyl or 3-thienyl group and do not have the 3-methyl or 3,4-dimethyl groups, remain potent and selective KOR antagonists. Of these, (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-(1S)-2-methyl-[4-methyl-4-pyridine-3-yl-carboxamide (3b) had the best overall binding potency and selectivity in a [(35)S]GTPγS functional assay, with a Ke=0.18nM at the KOR and 273- and 16,700-fold selectivity for the KOR relative to the MOR and DOR, respectively.

We describe the synthesis, pharmacological evaluation and docking calculations of KOP receptor ligands from the class of diphenethylamines using an active-like structure of the KOP receptor attained by molecular dynamics simulations. The structure-activity relationships derived from computational studies was in accordance with pharmacological activities of targeted diphenethylamines at the KOP receptor established by competition binding and G protein activation in vitro assays. Our analysis identified that agonist binding results in breaking of the Arg156-Thr273 hydrogen bond, which stabilizes the inactive receptor conformation, and a crucial hydrogen bond with His291 is formed. Compounds with a phenolic 4-hydroxy group do not form the hydrogen bond with His291, an important residue for KOP affinity and agonist activity. The size of the N-substituent hosted by the hydrophobic pocket formed by Val108, Ile316 and Tyr320 considerably influences binding and selectivity, with the n-alkyl size limit being five carbon atoms, while bulky substituents turn KOP agonists in antagonists. Thus, combination of experimental and molecular modeling strategies provides an initial framework for understanding the structural features of diphenethylamines that are essential to promote binding affinity and selectivity for the KOP receptor, and may be involved in transduction of the ligand binding event into molecular changes, ultimately leading to receptor activation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3858680,20200624,122589952|134139387|134147031,374283991|374295165|374322756,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27567368,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

We herein report that potassium permanganate supported on iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate can be used as a convenient oxidant in the one-step, heterogeneous conversion of Δ7,8-opioids to the corresponding 7β-hydroxy-8-ketones. Details of the reaction mechanism are given and the effects of the substituent at position 6 of several opioids on the reaction outcome is discussed.

According to the pharmacological results, the functional reversal observed in orvinol analogues by introduction of 7β-methyl substituent could not be reproduced in nepenthone analogues. Alternatively, introduction of 7β-methyl substituent was associated with substantial loss of both subtype selectivity and potency but not efficacy for nepenthone analogues, which was not found in 7β-methyl orvinol analogues. Surprisingly, SLL-603, a 7β-methyl analogue of SLL-020ACP, was identified to be a KOR full agonist. The possible molecular mechanism for the heterogeneity in activity cliff was also investigated.

It is implicated in nociception, diuresis, emotion, cognition, and immune system functions. KOP agonists possess a strong analgesic effect accompanied by a feeling of dysphoria. On the other hand, antagonists of this receptor were found to block depression, anxiety, and drug-seeking behaviors in animal models. Recently, great interest has been given to the development of selective KOP antagonists as an addiction treatment that does not cause dependence itself or show high relapse rates like the currently used agents. This review provides a comprehensive survey of the KOP antagonists developed for this purpose together with their in vivo studies and clinical trials.

Indeed, dextro enantiomers bind with high affinity σ1 receptor while opposite enantiomers bind opioid receptors. In spite of their stereochemistry, cis-N-2-phenylethyl N-normetazocine (phenazocine) enantiomers showed mixed opioid/σ1 receptor profiles and a significant in vivo analgesia. To the best of our knowledge, there is no information available regarding the evaluation of σ1 pharmacological profile in the antinociceptive effects of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine. Therefore, the present study was designed to ascertain this component by in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, we tested the σ1 affinity of both enantiomers by a predictive binding assay in absence or presence of phenytoin (DPH). Our results showed that DPH (1 mM) did not increase the σ1 receptor affinity of (+)-and (-)-phenazocine (Ki = 3.8 ± 0.4 nM, Ki = 85 ± 2.0 nM, respectively) suggesting a σ1 antagonist profile of both enantiomers. This σ1 antagonistic component of two phenazocine enantiomers was corroborated by in vivo studies in which the selective σ1 receptor agonist PRE-084, was able to unmask their σ1 antagonistic component associated with the opioid activity. The σ1 antagonistic component of (+)- and (-)-phenazocine may justify their analgesic activity and it suggests that they may constitute useful lead compounds to develop new ligands with this dual activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4000649,20200620,11314197,136933674,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27721146,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or 99mTc for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) or the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEK cells transfected with μ (HEK-mu) or δ (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity.

Based on 3 functionally α6β2/3γ2 GABAAR selective pyrazoloquinolinones, 42 novel analogs were synthesized, and their in vitro metabolic stability and cytotoxicity as well as their in vivo pharmacokinetics, basic behavioral pharmacology, and effects on locomotion were investigated. Incorporation of deuterium into the methoxy substituents of the ligands increased their duration of action via improved metabolic stability and bioavailability, while their selectivity for the GABAAR α6 subtype was retained. 8b was identified as the lead compound with a substantially improved pharmacokinetic profile. The ligands allosterically modulated diazepam insensitive α6β2/3γ2 GABAARs and were functionally silent at diazepam sensitive α1β2/3γ2 GABAARs, thus no sedation was detected. In addition, these analogs were not cytotoxic, which render them interesting candidates for treatment of CNS disorders mediated by GABAAR α6β2/3γ2 subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4037843,20200621,124111399,381861765,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29481759,0,NULL,P41143,9606,45,,NULL

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite. Herein we describe the discovery of second-generation HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 with increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile achieved by reduction of phase 2 metabolism. Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties. In a phase 1 dose-escalation study, the clinical pharmacokinetics for PT2977 supports the hypothesis that attenuating the rate of glucuronidation would improve exposure and reduce variability in patients.

Contrary to the classical monomeric model, indirect evidence suggests that ORs might form dimers, which could be endowed with a distinct pharmacological profile, and, thus, be targeted to develop innovative pharmacological therapies. However, direct evidence for the spontaneous formation of OR dimers in living cells under physiological conditions is missing. Despite a growing interest in the κ opioid receptor (KOR), KOR-selective fluorescent probes are particularly scarce in the literature. Herein, we present the first set of fluorescent KOR-selective probes with antagonistic properties.

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity.

ML417 was also found to protect against neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons derived from iPSCs.

By reevaluating the binding of 3 to P2Y14R computationally, two alternatives, i.e., alkynyl and triazolyl derivatives, were identified. Improved synthesis of fluorescent antagonist 4 enabled affinity quantification (IC50s, nM) using flow cytometry of P2Y14R-expressing CHO cells. p-F3C-phenyl-triazole 65 (32) was more potent than a corresponding alkyne 11. Thus, additional triazolyl derivatives were prepared, as guided by docking simulations, with nonpolar aryl substituents favored. Although triazoles were less potent than 3 (6), simpler synthesis facilitated further structural optimization.

Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430773,20210302,155532072,440142712,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,NULL,P41143,9606,45,,NULL

76378,Confirmatory,Tested for inhibition of amplification of electrically induced twitch in guinea pig ileum (GPI),"Title: Phe3-substituted analogues of deltorphin C. Spatial conformation and topography of the aromatic ring in peptide recognition by delta opioid receptors._||_Abstract: In order to study the contribution of the electronic, hydrophobic, and conformational properties of the amino acid residue at position 3 in deltorphin C on binding to delta and mu opioid receptors, a series of 5- and 6-membered ring and bicyclic amino acid replacements at position 3 were prepared by solution synthesis methods. In general, the substitutions were deleterious for high delta affinity (Ki delta) and delta selectivity (Ki mu/Ki delta). However, several notable exceptions were recognized: peptides containing the constrained, bicyclic structures Aic3 and (R or S) Atc3 enhanced delta affinity, but only the latter increased delta selectivity 4-fold (= 2475) relative to deltorphin C (= 661); at the other extreme, delta affinity of N alpha MePh3 fell 900-fold. Bioassays of [N alpha MePhe3]-, [(R or S)C alpha MePhe3]-, [Tic3]-, [Aic3]-, and [(R or S) Atc3]deltorphin C using guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) for mu and delta bioactivity, respectively, revealed a significant correlation (r = 0.916) between MVD bioactivity and delta binding in brain membranes. [(R or S)Atc3]deltorphin C also exhibited the highest biological selectivity (GPI/MVD) (= 3,522), which was 3-fold greater than that observed for deltorphin C. Molecular modelling of [N alpha MePhe3]- and [(S)Atc3]deltorphin C established that these amino acid replacements for Phe3 produce alterations in the backbone (phi,psi) and side-chain (chi 1,chi 2) dihedrals which critically affect the flexibility of the peptide and possibly limit accessible conformations for its alignment within the delta opioid receptor. The data provide evidence that the delta receptor is sensitive to changes in the composition, conformation, and orientation of the side chain of residue 3 of a linear opioid heptapeptide.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL684401,20181014,10010455|10055958|10485385|44348435|44348542|44348645,103316202|103353318|103353645|103353949|103354012|103354013,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8254604,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors. The possible significance of these results is discussed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL690226,20181010,118718761,312365632,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3020244,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The 4-substituted series (6-9) were substantially less potent than the corresponding 3-substituted compounds. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated high levels of direct kappa-specific staining of mouse microglial cells by the fluorescent probe 5 containing a tetraglycyl linker, as indicated by a 41% decrease in percent cells positively labeled and a 61% decrease in mean fluorescence intensity in the presence of the kappa-selective antagonist, norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). In similar studies, the probe 2 without a linker exhibited only nonspecific binding.

The corresponding acetamide derivatives (5-7) also were synthesized to serve as nonelectrophilic controls. The o- and p-isothiocyanates (2 and 4) and the haloamides (8-11) were selective delta opioid receptor antagonists in the mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations, while the meta isomer 3 was a delta-selective full agonist (IC50 = 5 nM). The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component. The m-isothiocyanate 3 was found to be a delta-selective and irreversible agonist in the MVD, and it is suggested that it may be covalently binding to an agonist recognition site.

Role of conformation of the delta address moiety._||_Abstract: Naltrindole (1) (NTI) is a highly potent and selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist. In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors.

147940,Confirmatory,Compound was evaluated for the agonistic activity against Opioid receptor delta 1 in hamster vas deferens.,"Title: Synthesis and biological activities of dynorphin A analogues with opioid antagonist properties._||_Abstract: Dynorphin A, which displays a wide variety of physiological effects, binds to opioid receptors preferentially at the kappa receptor type. kappa-selective antagonists would be very useful as pharmacological and biochemical probes to study and better understand the action of dynorphin A at its preferred receptor. However, the development of such molecules has been elusive, and very few are known at this time. Taking these features into account, we have synthesized by the solid-phase procedure several analogues of dynorphin A containing various D-amino acid substitutions. The binding properties of the peptides have been examined at three main opioid binding sites (mu, delta, and kappa) and their kappa selectivity determined. Their biological activities have been tested in three specific pharmacological assays for agonist and/or antagonist properties. Introduction of D-Trp substitution leads to analogues, in particular [D- Trp2,8,D-Pro10]-, [D-Trp5,8,D-Pro10]-, and [D-Trp2,4,8,D-Pro10]dynorphin(1-11), showing antagonist properties in the isolated rabbit vas deferens preparation, a kappa specific bioassay. The antagonism against dynorphin A is weak, as indicated by the observed Ke values (433, 199, and 293 nM, respectively), and not very selective (kappa vs. mu). Such peptide analogues derived from the endogenous ligand and endowed with antagonist properties are the first ones reported to date and could open a promising way in designing more potent and selective kappa opioid antagonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754286,20181010,3086114|10351514|70685720|73345747|73351837|73353313,103303449|103382605|160678353|174485339|174505789|174510939,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2876099,0,NULL,P41143,10029,NULL,,NULL

These compounds, formally derived from SNC-80 (2) by replacing the piperazine ring with a piperidine ring containing an exocyclic carbon carbon double bond, were found to bind with high affinity and exhibit excellent selectivity for the delta opioid receptor as full agonists. 6a, the simplest structure in the class, exhibited an IC(50) = 0.87 nM for the delta opioid receptors and extremely high selectivity over the mu receptors (mu/delta = 4370) and the kappa receptors (kappa/delta = 8590). Rat liver microsome studies on a selected number of compounds show these olefinic piperidine compounds (6) to be considerably more stable than SNC-80. This novel series of compounds appear to interact with delta opioid receptors in a similar way to SNC-80 since they demonstrate similar SAR.

148086,Confirmatory,Binding affinity was measured against mutated human Opioid receptor delta 1 (W248L),"Title: De novo design, synthesis, and biological activities of high-affinity and selective non-peptide agonists of the delta-opioid receptor._||_Abstract: On the basis of the structure-activity relationships of delta-opioid-selective peptide ligands and on a model of the proposed bioactive conformation for a potent and selective, conformationally constrained delta-opioid peptide ligand [(2S, 3R)-TMT1]DPDPE, a series of small organic peptide mimetic compounds targeted for the delta-opioid receptor have been designed, synthesized, and evaluated in radiolabeled ligand binding assays and in vitro bioassays. The new non-peptide ligands use piperazine as a template to present the most important pharmacophore groups, including phenol and phenyl groups and a hydrophobic moiety. This hydrophobic group was designed to mimic the hydrophobic character of the D-Pen residues in DPDPE, which has been found to be extremely important for increasing the binding affinity and selectivity of these non-peptide ligands for the delta-opioid receptor over the mu-opioid receptor. Compound 6f (SL-3111) showed 8 nM binding affinity and over 2000-fold selectivity for the delta-opioid receptor over the mu-opioid receptor. Both enantiomers of SL-3111 were separated, and the (-)-isomer was shown to be the compound with the highest affinity for the delta-opioid receptor found in our study (IC50 = 4.1 nM), with a selectivity very similar to that observed for the racemic compound. The phenol hydroxyl group of SL-3111 turned out to be essential to maintain high affinity for the delta-opioid receptor, which also was observed in the case of the delta-opioid-selective peptide ligand DPDPE. Binding studies of SL-3111 and [p-ClPhe4]DPDPE on the cloned wild-type and mutated human delta-opioid receptors suggested that the new non-peptide ligand has a binding profile similar to that of DPDPE but different from that of (+)-4-[((alphaR)-alpha(2S,5R)-4-allyl-2, 5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide (SNC-80), another delta-opioid-selective non-peptide ligand.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750420,20181016,123924|159564|9909743,103175041|103385063|103385064,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9822547,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Isopavines as a new class of morphinomimetics and their human opioid receptor binding activity._||_Abstract: The importance of visual imagery and relational thinking manifests itself in a heuristic approach to the design and synthesis of potential morphinomimetics as agonists of the human mu receptor. The well-known class of alkaloids represented by the isopavine nucleus has a topological resemblance to the morphine skeleton, especially when viewed in a particular way. Enantiopure isopavines can be readily obtained from a 1,2 Stevens rearrangement of 13-substituted dihydromethanodibenzoazocines, prepared in four steps from d- and l-amino acids. Consideration of the topology and the expected orientation of the nitrogen lone pair for a better overlap with morphine necessitates the utilization of d-amino acids. By variation of the substituents on the aromatic rings and a judicious choice of ring substituents, it is possible to obtain low nanomolar binding to the human mu receptor while maintaining good to excellent mu/delta selectivity. Agonist-like activity is indicated in a functional assay for one of the analogues originally derived from d-alanine as a precursor.

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751261,20181017,105104|5288826|5497186|10430432|10645976|15548354|15548355|44349947|71456174|73346599|73349647|73352661,103169185|103177815|103357118|103357774|103357911|103697951|163322761|163326190|163326191|174489426|174499610|174509985,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

This analogue possesses high affinity and selectivity for the kappa opioid receptor (K(i)(kappa) = 2.7 nM, K(i) ratio kappa/micro/delta = 1/2110/3260). The gain in selectivity is achieved through an overall reduction of opioid receptor affinity which is most pronounced at micro and delta receptors. The Pro(3) analogue exhibits antagonist properties. Despite its high kappa affinity, [Pro(3)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH(2) is a relatively weak antagonist in both the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay (IC(50) = 380 nM) and the guinea pig ileum assay (K(e) = 244 nM). Discrepancies between GPI and binding assay have often been ascribed to differential kappa receptor subtypes prevailing in central vs peripheral neurons.

The key step in the synthesis of the target compound involves the ring opening of Cbz-d-serine beta-lactone with Boc-Phe-NHCH2CH2NHCH3. Further synthetic elaboration of the resulting building block yielded compound 1 (MABE, Tyr-c[(NbetaCH3)-D-A2pr-Gly-Phe-NHCH2CH2-], where A2pr is a 2,3-diaminopropionic acid residue). Utilizing a combination of NMR and molecular modeling, the structure-biological activity relationships for compound 1 were studied. Using an in vitro isolated receptor assay, MABE was found to have affinities for isolated mu delta, and kappa opioid receptors of 1.6, 2.1, and 340 nM, respectively. By an in vivo thermal escape assay, MABE was found to have an ED50 of 0.027 microg in the rat when administered intrathecally. This effect was reversed by naloxone.

A varied degree of kappa receptor selectivity was a feature of this novel class of antinociceptive agents (mu/kappa ratio from 44 to 950 according to the nature of the basic moiety).

149192,Confirmatory,Binding affinity was measured by the displacement of [3H]- DADLE in guinea pig brain membrane of opioid receptor delta,"Title: Design of peptidomimetic delta opioid receptor antagonists using the message-address concept._||_Abstract: Highly selective nonpeptide ligands with potent delta opioid receptor antagonist activity have been developed using the message-address concept. This approach envisaged the delta opioid receptor to contain two major recognition subsites; a message subsite which recognizes the pharmacophore, and an address subsite that is unique for the delta receptor type and confers selectivity. The message and address components of the delta-selective enkephalins were postulated to be Tyr1 and Phe4, respectively, with Gly2-Gly3 functioning as a spacer. The message component of the target compounds in this study was derived from naltrexone and related structures. An indole system was fused to the C ring of naltrexone as a mimic of the address component. The benzene moiety of indole was viewed as the delta address component, mimicking the phenyl group of Phe4, and the pyrrole portion was used as a rigid spacer. Members of the series (1-23) were evaluated for opioid antagonist activity on the guinea pig ileum (GPI) and mouse vas deferens (MVD) preparations. Naltrindole (NTI, 1) was the most potent member of the series, with Ke values of approximately 0.1 nM at delta receptors. The antagonism by NTI was approximately 220- and 350-fold greater at delta than at mu and kappa opioid receptors. The binding of NTI and selected members of the series to guinea pig brain membranes was qualitatively consistent with their pharmacologic antagonist activity profiles in the MVD and GPI, but the Ki values were not in the same rank order. The selectivity of NTI arises mainly as a consequence of increased affinity at delta receptors. Thus, the Ke and Ki values of NTI were 1/530 and 1/90 that of the delta antagonist enkephalin analogue, ICI 174864. In contrast to NTI, ICI174864 derives its selectivity through greatly decreased recognition at mu and kappa receptors. The implications of the high affinity and selectivity of NTI as a consequence of its conformational rigidity are discussed. It is suggested that any attempt to model a receptor-bound conformation of an opioid peptide should consider affinity and potency at multiple receptor sites rather than selectivity alone.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL757336,20181012,5360515|5362396|5491897|5497186|44149909|44292854|44578135|46877619|46877621|46877624|46877629|46877643|46877816|73348734,103229769|103230026|103553488|103623353|103623354|103697951|103734670|103734672|103734678|103734685|103734703|103734987|131283791|174495355,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,2160538,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The introduction of a hydroxy substituent in position 5 of the isoquinoline nucleus generated a compound, 40, which is 2 times more potent than the previously disclosed unsubstituted analogue 39 in mouse models of antinociception. A QSAR analysis of the 5-substitution clearly demonstrates that antinociceptive activity is inversely associated with the lipophilicity of the substituents. The substituted compounds described herein are less selective for the kappa opioid receptors than the unsubstituted isoquinoline 39. For example, the 5-hydroxy-substituted compound 59 shows high affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki kappa = 0.09 nM) and a Ki mu/Ki kappa ratio of only 5. However, a multiple linear regression analysis demonstrates a lack of correlation between antinociceptive activity and affinity for the mu opioid receptor.

Chromatography of the mixture resulted in conversion of the bulk of the thiol 9 to the disulfide 13 by air oxidation. The disulfide 13 was also prepared by condensing the tert-butyldimethylsilyl ether of 4 with the dithiodiglycolyl chloride and treating the resulting product with F- to give the desired product. The pure thiol 9 free of contamination with the disulfide was prepared by treating 13 with excess N-acetyl-L-cysteine and processing the reaction mixture without resorting to chromatography for purification. The corresponding N-(cyclopropylmethyl) nor compound 15 was prepared from the silyl ether 6 and acetylthioglycolyl chloride followed by hydrolysis, treatment with F-, and air oxidation. Incubation of bovine striatal membranes with 13 and 15 resulted in wash-resistant inhibition of the binding of the mu-selective peptide [3H][D-Ala2,(Me)Phe4,Gly(ol)5]-enkephalin (DAMGO). Incubation of membranes with mu but not kappa or delta ligands protected the mu binding sites from alkylation by 13 and 15. The wash-resistant inhibition of mu opioid binding was partially reversed by the addition of the reducing reagent dithiothreitol (DTT). A Scatchard plot of the effect of 13 and 15 on [3H]DAMGO binding showed that these affinity ligands caused a marked decrease in the Bmax value without affecting the Kd value. The wash-resistant inhibition of binding, the reduction in the number of binding sites, the partial reversal of wash-resistant inhibition of binding by DTT, and previously observed long-term antagonism of mu opioid receptors in vivo support the conclusion that 13 and 15 bind covalently to the mu opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750116,20200703,44287225,103218530,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7515442,0,NULL,P41143,9913,NULL,,NULL

Opioid receptor affinity studies have revealed the virtual absence of enantioselectivity for receptor binding, particularly at the mu-receptor, for the (+)-3a-f and the (-)-3a-f series.

Antinociceptive studies demonstrated that (dl)-22 was a full kappa-agonist while (+)-3a and (-)-3a did not possess kappa-activity.

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance. These results indicate that appropriate molecular manipulations of the morphinan templates could provide ligands with mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist profiles and such ligands may have the potential of emerging as novel analgesic drugs devoid of tolerance, dependence, and related side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753968,20181018,5497186|9805452|10050608|10365429|11153683|11186271|11190061|11213578|11282704|11292839|11351769|11359624,103697951|103734664|103734665|103734931|103734932|103734934|103734935|103734937|103734938|103734939|103734941|103734942,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14998329,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

It was shown that high-affinity, fully efficacious, and delta opioid receptor-selective compounds can be obtained from this transposition. In addition to the N,N-diethylamido group needed as the delta address, the structural features identified to promote delta receptor affinity in the set of compounds studied included a cis relative stereochemistry between the 3- and 4-substituents in the piperidine ring, a trans-crotyl or allyl substituent on the basic nitrogen, the lack of a 2-methyl group in the piperidine ring, and either no substitution or hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring not substituted with the N,N-diethylamido group. Structural features found to be important for mu affinity include hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring, the presence of a 2-methyl group in a cis relative relationship to the 4-amino group as well as N-substituents such as cyclopropylmethyl. It was also determined that mu receptor affinity could be increased while maintaining delta receptor affinity, especially when hydroxyl-substituted compounds are considered. Additionally, it was discovered that the somewhat lower mu/delta selectivities observed for the piperidine compounds relative to the piperazine-based ligands appear to arise as a consequence of the carbon-nitrogen transposition which imparts an overall lower delta and higher mu affinity to the piperidine-based ligands. This higher affinity for the mu receptor, apparently intrinsic to the piperidine-based compounds, suggests that ligands of this class will more easily be converted to mu/delta combination agonists compared to the piperazine ligands such as 1. This is particularly important since analogues of 1, which show both mu- and delta-type activity, are now recognized as important for their strong analgesia and cross-canceling of many of the side effects found in agonists operating exclusively from either the delta or mu opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754688,20181017,105104|5462471|10320022|10410736,103177815|103217856|103435316|163333315,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11300879,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The peptidic analogues were synthesized by solid phase techniques using a Fmoc/tert-butyl strategy, and the psi(CH2-NH) bond, or reduced bond, was introduced via reductive alkylation of the N-terminal amino group of the growing peptide with a Fmoc-N(alpha)-protected amino aldehyde. The synthesis of Fmoc-N(alpha)-protected amino aldehydes also is described. Several other peptides have been previously synthesized incorporating this modification and showed for instance increased enzymatic stability and antagonist properties. Results obtained in the GPB show that modifications of the peptide bond in the address site (analogues 4-9) do not affect the binding at the kappa receptor and, with a few exceptions, at the mu and delta receptors. On the other hand, analogues 2 and 3, modified in the message segment of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2, show a decrease in binding affinity at all three receptors. In the GPI, the results are more varied as the influence of the peptide bond modification seems to be more important than in the GPB.

In smooth muscle preparations, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the affinity labels 3-6 behaved as kappa agonists in that they were potently antagonized by norbinaltorphimine (norBNI). In addition to the high binding affinity and selectivity of the 3-isothiocyanate 3 (DIPPA) to kappa opioid receptors, wash studies have suggested that this involves covalent binding. In the mouse tail-flick assay, the 3- and 4-substituted isomers (3 and 5, respectively) produced long-lasting antagonism of the antinociceptive effect of the kappa opioid agonist, (+/-)-trans-2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl) cyclohexyl]acetamide ((+/-)-U50,488). In contrast, the non-electrophilic parent compound (+)-S-2 and the fumaramate derivative 4 were devoid of antagonist activity in the tail-flick assay. At substantially different doses, DIPPA (3) and the 4-isothiocyanate 5 also produced antinociception in the mouse abdominal stretch assay. In addition, DIPPA and the 3-fumaramate methyl ester 4 had improved in vivo kappa-selectivities compared to the unsubstituted parent compound (+)-S-2 and the para-substituted derivative 5. The improved kappa-selectivities of 3 and 4 and the different agonist and antagonist potencies of 3 and 5 may be explained respectively by the existence of multiple kappa agonist binding sites and distinct agonist and antagonist binding sites. In view of the antagonist selectivity and the apparent irreversible binding of DIPPA to kappa receptors, it may serve as a useful pharmacologic or biochemical tool to investigate kappa opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL749997,20181014,10456060,103230742,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7799399,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

Several of these analogues, bridged between positions 5 and 11 of Dyn A1-11-NH2, exhibited unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu receptors of the central over the peripheral nervous systems. In order to further investigate the conformational and topographical requirements for the residues in positions 5 and 11 of these analogues, we have synthesized a systematic series of Dyn A1-11-NH2 analogues incorporating the sulfydryl containing amino acids L- and D-Cys and L- and D-Pen in positions 5 and 11, thus producing 16 cyclic peptides. In addition, Dyn A1-11-NH2, [D-Leu5]Dyn A1-11-NH2, and [D-Lys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 were synthesized as standards.

These same analogues and most others exhibited a much lower activity in the guinea pig ileum (GPI), thus leading to centrally vs peripherally selective peptides, but showed a different structure-activity relationship than found previously. In a wider scope, this series of analogues also provided new insights into which amino acids (and their configurations) may be used in positions 5 and 11 of Dyn A analogues for high potency and good selectivity at kappa opioid receptors.

Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective.

These O3-ether ligands appeared to show significant affinity for opioid receptors, about 2-fold less than the parent phenols, and their receptor selectivities were similar. However, on close examination of the stability of a representative ether 2b in the radioligand displacement assay, considerable O3-dealkylation was observed. The dealkylation process occurred even after denaturation of the proteins of the membrane preparation, and it occurred in the presence of model nucleophiles imidazole and thiophenol. Thus, what apparently was unusual activity is explained by O3-dealkylation to the parent phenol (e.g., 2a). Saturated ether analog 2c was not dealkylated under the conditions of the radioligand displacement assay and was a very weak opioid ligand.

Thus, a series of cyclic lactam analogues of dynorphin A(1-11)-NH2 have been designed, synthesized and evaluated by the guinea pig brain (GPB) binding assay and guinea pig ileum (GPI) bioassay to evaluate the conformational analysis prediction and, further, to investigate the conformational requirements for high potency and selectivity for kappa opioid receptors. Positions 2-6, 3-7, and 5-9 were chosen as the sites for incorporating cyclic conformational constraints. Cyclization between D-Asp(2) and Lys(6) in c[D-Asp(2),Lys(6)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to an analogue with pronounced potency and selectivity enhancement for the mu opioid receptor, whereas cyclization between D-Asp(3) and Lys(7) in c[D-Asp(3),Lys(7)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 led to a potent ligand (IC(50) 4.9 nM) with kappa receptor selectivity. The other analogues in the series proved to be less selective. The biological results led to the suggestion that the binding conformation for the kappa receptor may have structural requirements that are distinct from those of mu and delta receptors. Interestingly, analogues with a D-Asp at position 2, 3, or 9 were found to be more potent for the kappa receptor than analogues with an L-Asp at the same positions. It is suggested that the incorporation of D-Asp into position 2, 3, or 9 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 may have stereochemical and conformational effects on the nearby amino acids which can help discriminate the preference between kappa, mu, and delta receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL750006,20181015,44269673|44269677|44269678|44269681|44269682|44269730|44269731|44269732|44269737|44269750|44269751|44269752,103177263|103177289|103177290|103177300|103177301|103177531|103177532|103177533|103177552|103177607|103177608|103177609,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8676350,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The glycine residues in the 2 and 3 positions of dynorphin A may affect the relative orientation of the aromatic rings in positions 1 and 4, but their flexibility precludes careful analysis. To examine these effects on dynorphin A, we previously have synthesized the linear analogues [D-Ala3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (2) and [Ala3]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (3) and reported their biological activities. Analogues 2 and 3 displayed affinities for the central kappa opioid receptor (IC50 = 0.76 and 1.1 nM, respectively) similar to that of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (1) (IC50 = 0.58 nM) and greatly enhanced selectivities for kappa vs mu and kappa vs delta receptors (IC50 ratios of 350 and 1300 for 2, and 190 and 660 for 3, respectively). These results suggest that the structure and lipophilicity of the amino acid present in position 3 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 as well as the conformational changes they induce in the message sequence of dynorphin have important effects on potency and selectivity for kappa opioid receptors. To further investigate structure-activity relationships involving the residue at the 3 position of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2, a series of Dyn A analogues with aromatic, charged, and aliphatic side chain substitutions at the 3 position was designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their affinities for kappa, mu, and delta opioid receptors. It was found that analogues with lipophilic amino acids at the 3 position of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 generally displayed higher affinity but similar selectivities for the kappa receptor than analogues with charged residues at the same position. It is suggested that the structural, configurational, and steric/lipophilic effects of amino acids at position 3 of Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 may play an important role in potency and selectivity for the kappa receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL751018,20181015,25079903,174484944,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8691442,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

Peptides extended at the C-terminus with residues which can be used as handles for further modification and/or labeling (i.e. Asx, Glx, and Lys) were synthesized. The TIPP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives exhibited similar delta-receptor affinity to TIPP (K(i) = 5-10 nM vs K(i) = 6 nM), and neither the location of the carboxylic acid moiety nor the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue significantly affected the delta-receptor affinity of these derivatives. Extension of TIPP with an additional residue did not increase mu-receptor affinity, even though the position of the acidic group, which imparts delta-receptor selectivity to TIPP, was shifted relative to the carboxylic acid moiety of TIPP. The delta-receptor affinities of the TIP-D/L-Asx/Glx derivatives were found to be influenced mainly by the position of the carboxylic acid function rather than the stereochemistry of the C-terminal residue. TIP(P)-D/L-Lys(Ac)-OH derivatives exhibited moderate delta-receptor affinity (K(i)(delta) = 16-28 nM).

Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on JDTic analogues revealed that the 3R,4R stereochemistry of the 3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine core structure, the 3R attachment of the 7-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline group, and the 1S configuration of the 2-methylpropyl (isopropyl) group were all important to its kappa potency and selectivity. The results suggest that, like other kappa opioid antagonists such as nor-BNI and GNTI, JDTic requires a second basic amino group to express potent and selective kappa antagonist activity in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS functional assay. However, unlike previously reported kappa antagonists, JDTic also requires a second phenol group in rigid proximity to this second basic amino group. The potent and selective kappa antagonist properties of JDTic can be rationalized using the 'message-address' concept wherein the (3R,4R)-3,4-dimethyl-4-(hydroxyphenyl)piperidinyl group represents the message, and the basic amino and phenol group in the N substituent constitutes the address.

The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor.

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo.

The pyridine ring unsubstituted pyridomorphinans possessing the oxymorphone and hydromorphone framework displayed nearly equal binding affinity at the micro and delta receptors. Their affinities at the kappa site were nearly 10-fold less than their binding affinities at the micro and delta sites. Introduction of aryl substituents at the 5'-position on the pyridine ring improved the binding affinity at the delta site while decreasing the binding affinity at the micro site. Nearly all of the ligands possessing an N-methyl group at the17-position with or without a hydroxyl group at the 14-position of the morphinan moiety displayed agonist activity at the micro receptor with varying potencies and efficacies. In the [(35)S]GTP-gamma-S binding assays, most of these pyridomorphinans were devoid of any significant agonist activity at the delta and kappa receptors but displayed moderate to potent antagonist activity at the delta receptors. In antinociceptive evaluations using the warm-water tail-withdrawal assay in mice, the pyridomorphinans produced analgesic effects with varying potencies and efficacies when administered by the intracerebroventricular route. Among the ligands studied, the hydromorphone-derived 4-chlorophenylpyridomorphinan 7h was identified as a ligand possessing a promising profile of mixed micro agonist/delta antagonist activity in vitro and in vivo. In a repeated administration paradigm in which the standard micro agonist morphine produces significant tolerance, repeated administration of the micro agonist/delta antagonist ligand 7h produced no tolerance.

Additionally in the (R)-series there was a 700-fold increase in kappa-agonist potency in the [(35)S]GTPgammaS assay when OEt was replaced by OBn. The data can be explained in a triple binding site model: an H-bonding site, a lipophilic site, and an inhibitory site with which the 20-Me group in the (S)-ethers may interact.

The thiophene analogue 2 displayed binding selectivity that was of the same order of magnitude as that of 1a, while 3 was considerably less selective for kappa site. This is consistent with the fact that the second pharmacophore in 1a and 2 displayed a greater degree of superposition than 1a and 3.

In most cases, high affinity at micro and kappa receptors, and lower affinity at delta receptor was observed, resulting in good selectivity for micro and kappa receptors. A wide range of substituents can be accommodated on the nitrogen position. The N-(S)-tetrahydrofurfuryl analogue 11 displayed the highest affinity at all three receptors. The N-cyclobutylmethyl analogue 13 gave both high affinity and selectivity at kappa receptor, and N-2-phenylethyl analogue 18 exhibited good affinity and selectivity at micro receptor. Further modifications of the 3-substituent indicated that one H-bond donor was an essential requirement for good affinity at micro and kappa receptors. Similar modifications were investigated at the 3-OH group of morphinans: levorphanol (2a), cyclorphan (2b), and MCL-101 (2c) lacking the 10-keto group. The 3-amino bioisosteric analogues (40 and 41) displayed reasonably good affinity at micro and kappa receptors. The 3-carboxamido replacement (compounds 46-48) in the morphinan subseries resulted in similar affinities comparable to their corresponding 3-OH congeners.

The compounds were biased toward opioid receptor antagonist activity by incorporating (+)-(3R,4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (a potent, nonselective opioid pure antagonist) as one of the monomers. The other two monomers, which included N-substituted or unsubstituted Boc-protected amino acids and a range of substituted aryl carboxylic acids, were selected to add chemical diversity. Screening of these compounds in competitive binding experiments with the kappa opioid receptor selective ligand [3H]U69,593 led to the discovery of a novel kappa opioid receptor selective ligand, N-¿(2'S)-[3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanamido]-3'-methylbutyl¿-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (8, RTI-5989-29). Additional structure-activity relationship studies suggested that 8 possesses lipophilic and hydrogen-bonding sites that are important to its opioid receptor potency and selectivity. These sites appear to exist predominantly within the kappa receptor since the selectivity arises from a 530-fold loss of affinity of 8 for the mu receptor and an 18-fold increase in affinity for the kappa receptor relative to the mu-selective ligand, (+)-N-[trans-4-phenyl-2-butenyl]-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (5a). The degree of selectivity observed in the radioligand binding experiments was not observed in the functional assay.

Chemical and pharmacological studies on compounds 6 have been pursued with the aim of expanding the SAR data and validating the previously proposed model of interaction of this class of compounds with the kappa-opioid receptor. The synthesis of the previously described compounds 6 has been reinvestigated in order to obtain a more direct synthetic procedure. To study the relationship between the stereochemistry and the receptor binding affinity, compounds 6e and 6k were selected on the basis of their evident structural resemblance to tifluadom. Since a different specificity of action could be expected for the enantiomers of 6e and 6k, owing to the results shown by (S)- and (R)-tifluadom, their racemic mixtures have been resolved by means of liquid chromatography with chiral stationary phases (CSP), and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers has been studied by circular dichroism (CD) and (1)H NMR techniques. Moreover, some new 2-[(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives, 6a-d,f,g,j, have been synthesized, while the whole series (6a-o) has been tested for its potential affinity toward human cloned kappa-opioid receptor. The most impressive result obtained from the binding studies lies in the fact that this series of 2-[2-(acylamino)ethyl]-1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives binds the human cloned kappa-opioid receptor subtype very tightly. Indeed, almost all the ligands within this class show subnanomolar K(i) values, and the least potent compound 6o shows, in any case, an affinity in the nanomolar range. A comparison of the affinities obtained in human cloned kappa-receptor with the correspondent one obtained in native guinea pig kappa-receptor suggests that the human cloned kappa-receptor is less effective in discriminating the substitution pattern than the native guinea pig kappa-receptor. Furthermore, the results obtained are discussed with respect to the interaction with the homology model of the human kappa-opioid receptor, built on the recently solved crystal structure of rhodopsin. Finally, the potential antinociceptive and antiamnesic properties of compounds 6e and 6i have been investigated by means of the hot-plate and passive avoidance test in mice, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL753670,20181017,105104|5288826|5497186|10430432|10645976|44349947,103169185|103177815|103357118|103357774|103357911|103697951,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930147,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

Conformational constraint in the 'address' sequence._||_Abstract: Several cyclic lactam analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 were prepared in order to reduce the conformational flexibility in different regions of the native linear peptide. Cyclo[D-Asp(i),Dap(i+3)]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 (Dap = alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid) analogues were designed on the basis of molecular modeling using AMBER, which suggested that this constraint may be compatible with an alpha-helix. The cyclic portion of these constrained analogues spanned from residues 3 to 9, a region proposed by Schwyzer (Biochemistry 1986, 25, 4281) to adopt a helical conformation at kappa receptor sites. Analogues containing Dab (alpha,gamma-diaminobutyric acid) or Orn in position i + 3 were also synthesized to examine the effects of larger ring size. The cyclic peptides exhibited marked differences in binding affinities for kappa, mu, and delta receptors and in opioid activity in the guinea pig ileum (GPI). Cyclo[D-Asp6,Dap9]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 showed both high kappa receptor affinity and potent agonist activity in the GPI, while cyclo[D-Asp3,Dap6]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 exhibited very weak binding affinity at all opioid receptors as well as very weak opioid activity in the GPI. Cyclo[D-Asp5,Dap8]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2 showed moderate binding affinity for kappa receptors and was the most kappa selective ligand in this study, but this peptide exhibited very weak agonist activity in the GPI assay. Compared to the corresponding linear peptides, all of the cyclic peptides exhibited decreased mu receptor affinity, while kappa receptor affinity was retained or improved. Therefore the corresponding linear peptides were generally mu selective while the cyclic constrained peptides demonstrated slight selectivity for kappa vs mu receptors or were nonselective. Increasing the ring size by incorporating Dab or Orn in positions 6, 8, or 9 did not significantly affect the binding affinity for the three opioid receptor types nor the opioid activity observed in the GPI. Circular dichroism spectra of the cyclo[D-Asp(i),Dap(i+3)] derivatives in 80% trifluoroethanol at 25 and 5 degrees C suggested differences in the stability of a helical structure when the constraint was incorporated near the N-terminus vs in the middle of the peptide.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754167,20181015,73348534|73348535|73351611|73353093,174495113|174495114|174505521|174510669,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9111295,0,NULL,P41143,10141,207,,NULL

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL754169,20181015,5360515,131283791,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

Recent evidence suggests that agonists acting at kappa opioid receptors may modulate the activity of dopaminergic neurons and alter the neurochemical and behavioral effects of cocaine. We describe the synthesis and chemical characterization of a series of morphinans 3a-c, structural analogues of cyclorphan [(-)-3-hydroxy-N-cyclopropylmethylmorphinan S(+)-mandelate, 3a], the 10-ketomorphinans 4a,b, and the 8-ketobenzomorphan 1b. Binding experiments demonstrated that the cyclobutyl analogue 3b [(-)-3-hydroxy-N-cyclobutylmethylmorphinan S(+)-mandelate, 3b, MCL-101] of cyclorphan (3a) had a high affinity for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors in guinea pig brain membranes. Both 3a,b were approximately 2-fold more selective for the kappa receptor than for the mu receptor. However 3b (the cyclobutyl analogue) was 18-fold more selective for the kappa receptor in comparison to the delta receptor, while cyclorphan (3a) had only 4-fold greater affinity for the kappa receptor in comparison to the delta receptor. These findings were confirmed in the antinociceptive tests (tail-flick and acetic acid writhing) in mice, which demonstrated that cyclorphan (3a) produced antinociception that was mediated by the delta receptor while 3b did not produce agonist or antagonist effects at the delta receptor. Both 3a,b had comparable kappa agonist properties. 3a,b had opposing effects at the mu receptor: 3b was a mu agonist whereas 3a was a mu antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758174,20181016,3036289|3037926|5359966|9804450|44273237|44273397|49860163|49860165|53324694|71461674,103185861|103186171|103230837|103230838|103241212|104234919|104234921|123099351|124972267|163336789,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10633042,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The corresponding Z-isomer 1b was not readily available through direct aldol condensation of naltrexone (6) with benzaldehyde. Using the photochemical methods employed by Lewis to isomerize cinnamamides, we have obtained Z-isomer 1b in good yield from E-isomer 1a. A series of (E)- and (Z)-7-arylidenenaltrexone derivatives was prepared to study the effect of larger arylidene groups on opioid receptor affinity in this series. By aldol condensation of naltrexone (6) with benzaldehyde, 1-naphthaldehyde, 2-naphthaldehyde, 4-phenylbenzaldehyde, and 9-anthracaldehyde, the (E)-arylidenes were readily obtained. Photochemical isomerization afforded the corresponding Z-isomers. These compounds were evaluated via opioid receptor radioligand displacement assays. In these assays, the Z-isomers generally had higher affinity and were more delta-selective than the corresponding E-isomers. The (Z)-7-(1-naphthylidene)naltrexone (3b) showed the greatest selectivity (delta:mu ratio of 15) and highest affinity delta-binding (Ki = 0.7 nM).

The inherent lability of peptides and their poor oral absorption have made peptidomimetics attractive targets for drug development. In this presentation I have discussed the design of a novel series of delta-selective opioid antagonists based on the message-address concept. The opioid peptides can be viewed to contain two elements: an essential message component that is recognized by the receptor subsite responsible for the signal transduction process and an address element that is recognized by a subsite that is unique to a single receptor type and functions to enhance binding to the site. Since the tyramine moiety in opiate structures is known to be important for activity, an identical element in Tyr1 of the opioid peptides can be viewed as the message. A key moiety of the delta address was considered to be the phenyl group of Phe4. Combining the universal opioid antagonist naltrexone (5) with a strategically located address mimic afforded naltrindole (6, NTI), the first nonpeptide delta opioid receptor antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL758768,20181013,5360515|5486827|5497186|44149909,103230026|103316718|103697951|131283791,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1648136,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The compounds that contain a basic N17' nitrogen (2-9) were found to be selective kappa antagonists. Amidation of N17' afforded congeners 10-12 with feeble kappa antagonist potency and low selectivity. The fact that potent antagonism and selectivity were observed only when members of the series contain a basic N17' nitrogen suggests that it interacts with extracellular domains of the kappa receptor that contain acidic amino acid residues. The N-terminal domain and extracellular loop 2, both of which contain acidic residues, are candidates for this interaction and may be components of the kappa address subsite of the receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755877,20181014,5480230|10078008|10327545|10416962|44283842|44283843,103211597|103211598|103211737|103212199|103212300|103698780,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8182708,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The study showed that compounds 7-9 bearing the trans-cinnamyl N-substituent most closely reproduced the potency at the opioid receptor of the flexible N-propylphenyl or N-propylcyclohexyl analogues previously reported. Neither the N-substituted cis-cinnamyl nor the cis-phenylcyclopropylmethyl compounds 10 and 11, respectively, showed high affinity for the opioid receptor. However, the N-trans-phenylcyclopropylmethyl compound 12 closely approximated the affinity of compounds 7-9. Additionally, we found that free rotation of the phenyl ring is necessary for high affinity binding and mu receptor subtype selectivity as the planar N-substituted thianaphthylmethyl and benzofuranylmethyl compounds 13 and 14 had significantly lower binding affinities. Altogether, these findings suggest that the high binding affinity, selectivity, and antagonist potency of N-propylphenyl or N-propylcyclohexyl analogues of (+)-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (4) are achieved via a conformation wherein the connecting chain of the N-substituents is extended away from piperidine nitrogen with the appended ring system rotated out-of-plane relative to the connecting chain atoms. This conformation is quite similar to that observed in the solid state for 5, as determined by single crystal X-ray analysis. Additionally, it was found that, unlike naltrexone, N-substituents bearing secondary carbons attached directly to the piperidine nitrogen of 4 suffer dramatic losses of potency vs analogues not substituted in this manner. Using a functional assay which measured stimulation or inhibition of [35S]GTP-gamma-S binding, we show that the trans-cinnamyl analogues of (+)-(3R, 4R)-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine (4) retain opioid pure antagonist activity and possess picomolar antagonist potency at the mu receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL755878,20181015,5360515|9840689|9906198|9973387|10808145,103234501|103234937|103234961|103235399|131283791,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9599247,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

In an effort to investigate the possibility that the polycationic 'tails' may be involved in a coulombic interaction with a complementary polyanionic receptor domain, we attached a series of achiral peptide-like cationic fragments to the C-terminus of the opioid peptide 'message', Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe. Binding of the various compounds to opioid receptor types in guinea pig brain membranes was weak, and the pharmacologic activities in the guinea pig ileum were marginal. These results indicate either that the chosen ligand design does not satisfy the structural requirements of the hypothesized coulombic interaction or that the latter is a minor criterion governing receptor recognition.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756032,20181013,15689720,103308844,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1895300,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

It was shown that high-affinity, fully efficacious, and delta opioid receptor-selective compounds can be obtained from this transposition. In addition to the N,N-diethylamido group needed as the delta address, the structural features identified to promote delta receptor affinity in the set of compounds studied included a cis relative stereochemistry between the 3- and 4-substituents in the piperidine ring, a trans-crotyl or allyl substituent on the basic nitrogen, the lack of a 2-methyl group in the piperidine ring, and either no substitution or hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring not substituted with the N,N-diethylamido group. Structural features found to be important for mu affinity include hydroxyl substitution in the aryl ring, the presence of a 2-methyl group in a cis relative relationship to the 4-amino group as well as N-substituents such as cyclopropylmethyl. It was also determined that mu receptor affinity could be increased while maintaining delta receptor affinity, especially when hydroxyl-substituted compounds are considered. Additionally, it was discovered that the somewhat lower mu/delta selectivities observed for the piperidine compounds relative to the piperazine-based ligands appear to arise as a consequence of the carbon-nitrogen transposition which imparts an overall lower delta and higher mu affinity to the piperidine-based ligands. This higher affinity for the mu receptor, apparently intrinsic to the piperidine-based compounds, suggests that ligands of this class will more easily be converted to mu/delta combination agonists compared to the piperazine ligands such as 1. This is particularly important since analogues of 1, which show both mu- and delta-type activity, are now recognized as important for their strong analgesia and cross-canceling of many of the side effects found in agonists operating exclusively from either the delta or mu opioid receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756034,20181017,123924,103175041,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11300879,0,NULL,P41143,10141,NULL,,NULL

The relationship between spacer length and selectivity at multiple opioid receptors._||_Abstract: Bivalent ligands containing the oxymorphamine or naltrexamine pharmacophores connected to spacers of varying length were synthesized and evaluated for their selectivity at mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors. The oxymorphamine bivalent ligands (1-8) behaved as mu agonists on the electrically stimulated guinea pig ileum longitudinal muscle preparation (GPI). The spacer that conferred peak agonist activity in these series contains a total of four glycyl units (n = 2). Binding studies with guinea pig brain membranes showed a qualitatively similar profile at mu receptors as a function of spacer length. Also, delta receptor selectivity increased as the spacer was lengthened. The naltrexamine bivalent ligands (9-13) effectively antagonized the mu receptor agonist morphine in the GPI at the same optimal spacer length (n = 2) as in the agonist series. However, the peak antagonism of ethylketazocine, a kappa receptor agonist, occurred with the bivalent ligand 9 containing the shortest spacer (n = 0), and it was found that 9 is the most selective kappa antagonist in the series. While receptor binding roughly parallels that of kappa antagonist activity in the GPI, no correlation between binding and antagonist activity was observed at mu opioid receptors.

In binding studies based on displacement of mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptor selective radiolabels from guinea pig brain membranes, the new analogues showed a negligible affinity for the kappa binding site and a preference for mu- over delta-receptors with an evident dependence on N- and/or C-terminal modifications; H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-OCH3 was shown to be one of the most selective mu-receptor ligands reported to date. All these tetrapeptides display dose-related naloxone-reversible antinociceptive effects following intracerebroventricular (icv) or subcutaneous (sc) administrations in mice. In comparison to morphine, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and the guanidino derivative H2NC = (NH)-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Gly-NH2 showed lower affinity for mu, delta, and kappa sites but exceptionally stronger analgesia: respectively they are 560 and 1550 times as potent an analgesic as morphine. Among analogues tested after sc administration, H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-Sar-NH2 and H-Tyr-D-MetO-Phe-D-Ala-OH displayed the highest activities; they were respectively 22 and 30 times more potent than morphine on a molar basis.

The use of these neuroactive peptides in diverse studies has led to an increased understanding of brain function. Unfortunately, the use of brain-derived peptides as pharmaceutical agents to alter brain chemistry in vivo has lagged because peptides do not readily penetrate the blood-brain barrier. Attachment of simple sugars to enkephalins increases their penetration of the blood-brain barrier and allows the resulting glycopeptide analogues to function effectively as drugs.

150088,Confirmatory,Binding affinity against Opioid receptor delta 1,"Title: Molecular docking reveals a novel binding site model for fentanyl at the mu-opioid receptor._||_Abstract: The ligand binding modes of a series of fentanyl derivatives are examined using a combination of conformational analysis and molecular docking to the mu-opioid receptor. Condensed-phase molecular dynamics simulations are applied to evaluate potential relationships between ligand conformation and fentanyl substitution and to generate probable 'bioactive' structures for the ligand series. Automated docking of the largely populated solution conformers identified a common binding site orientation that places the N-phenethyl group of fentanyl deep in a crevice between transmembrane (TM) helices II and III while the N-phenylpropanamide group projected toward a pocket formed by TM-III, -VI, and -VII domains. An analysis of the binding modes indicates the most potent fentanyl derivatives adopt an extended conformation both in solution and in the bound state, suggesting binding affinity may depend on the conformational preferences of the ligands. The results are consistent with ligand binding data derived from chimeric and mutant receptor studies as well as structure-activity relationship data reported on a wide range of fentanyl analogues. The binding site model is also compared to that of N-phenethylnormorphine. An overlay of the bound conformation of the opiate and cis-3-methylfentanyl shows the N-phenethyl groups occupy equivalent binding domains in the receptor. While the cationic amines of both ligand classes were found docked to an established anchor site (D149 in TM-III), no overlap was observed between the N-phenylpropanamide group and the remaining components of the opiate scaffold. The unique binding mode(s) proposed for the fentanyl series may, in part, explain the difficulties encountered in defining models of recognition at the mu-receptor and suggest opioid receptors may display multiple binding epitopes. Furthermore, the results provide new insight to the design of experiments aimed at understanding the structural basis to the differential selectivities of ligands at the mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL756180,20181017,3345|62156|124716|3041260|9976188|10021831|10428991,103173010|103182112|103224159|103349831|103349832|103349834|103734588,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10669565,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

To overcome this limitation, we enhanced the hydrophobicity while maintaining the aqueous solubility properties in a class of opioid-mimetic substances by inclusion of two identical N-termini consisting of Dmt (2',6'-dimethyl-l-tyrosine) coupled to a pyrazinone ring platform by means of alkyl chains to yield the class of 3,6-bis[Dmt-NH-(CH(2))(n)]-2(1H)-pyrazinones. These compounds displayed high micro-opioid receptor affinity (K(i)micro = 0.042-0.115 nM) and selectivity (K(i)delta/K(i)micro = 204-307) and functional micro-opioid receptor agonism (guinea-pig ileum, IC(50) = 1.3-1.9 nM) with little or undetectable bioactivity toward delta-opioid receptors (mouse vas deferens) and produced analgesia in mice in a naloxone reversible manner when administered centrally (intracerebroventricular, i.c.v.) or systemically (subcutaneously and orally). Furthermore, the most potent compound, 3,6-bis(3'-Dmt-aminopropyl)-5-methyl-2(1H)-pyrazinone (7'), lacked functional delta-opioid receptor bioactivity and was 50-63-fold and 18-21-fold more active than morphine by icv administration as measured analgesia using tail-flick (spinal involvement) and hot-plate (supraspinal effect) tests, respectively; the compound ranged from 16 to 63% as potent upon systemic injection. These analgesic effects are many times greater than unmodified opioid peptides.

Several of these Dyn A analogues exhibit unexpected selectivities for the kappa and mu opioid receptors(s) of the central vs peripheral nervous systems. Thus, incorporation of conformational constraint in the putative 'address' segment of Dyn A analogues has resulted in the kappa/mu opioid receptor ligands [Cys5,Cys11]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (1) and [Cys5,Cys11,D-Ala8]Dyn A1-11-NH2 (2), which possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities centrally (guinea pig brain, GPB), but only weak activity at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (guinea pig ileum, GPI). On the other hand, [Cys8,Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 and [D-Cys8,D-Cys13]Dyn A1-13-NH2 (5) display high kappa potencies and selectivities at the peripheral (GPI) but not at the central (GPB) kappa opioid receptor.

Among the compounds evaluated in mice for antinociceptive or opioid antagonist activities, aspartyl derivative 6 possessed the greatest difference between peripheral (po or iv) and icv equiactive antagonist doses. Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

When incubated with mouse or monkey liver S9 microsomes, (R)-3 is metabolized by N-demethylation and oxidation to (R)-5,6-dihydro-5-(methylamino)-4H-imidazo[4,5,1-ij]quinolin-2(1H) -one [(R)-6], intermediate metabolites, where N-demethylation to the imidazoquinoline (R)-4 and where oxidation to the imidazoquinolinone (R)-5 has taken place, are also observed in these incubates. A cross-species study on the metabolism of (R)-3 in vitro has shown large variations in the extent of metabolism from species to species.

Compared to naltrexone, 6 was greater than 100 times more potent by the icv route, but 6000-10,000 times less potent when administered po or icv.

All of these analogs possess high kappa and mu opioid receptor affinities for the central receptor (guinea pig brain), but effect only weak potency at peripheral kappa and mu opioid receptors (GPI). In fact cyclic dynorphin A analog 4 shows > 19,000-fold differences between central kappa opioid affinity and potency in the guinea pig ileum (GPI). Additionally analog 4 is not an antagonist in the GPI, suggesting possible receptor differences between these sites.

An attempt to determine how the geometry of the scaffold affects this selectivity has led to the synthesis of a bivalent ligand (5) whose linker constrains the N17' basic nitrogen (the 'address') to a position that is 6.5 A from N17' in the kappa antagonist norBNI (1) when these molecules are superimposed. The fact that compound 5 was found to be a highly selective and potent mu-selective antagonist supports the idea that the position of N17' in 5 precludes effective ion pairing with the nonconserved residue Glu297 on outer loop 3 of the kappa opioid receptor. The high mu receptor binding affinity and in vitro pharmacological selectivity of 5 coupled with its presumed low central nervous system bioavailability suggest that it may be a useful antagonist for the investigation of peripheral mu opioid receptors.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL849818,20200704,5360515|44297100,103238133|131283791,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8627605,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

228360,Literature-derived,Selectivity for kappa/Mu/Delta receptors was determined 1/1.7/90,"Title: Effects of the substitution of Phe4 in the opioid peptide [D-Ala8]dynorphin A-(1-11)NH2._||_Abstract: Phenylalanine at position 4 of the peptide dynorphin A (Dyn A) is an important residue for opioid receptor affinity and activity, but there is very little information available on the structure-activity relationships or conformational preference of this residue for interaction with kappa-opioid receptors. Based on the hypothesis that the spatial orientation of the aromatic ring at position 4 of Dyn A is important for opioid receptor affinity and selectivity, a series of Dyn A analogues with various Phe derivatives substituted at position 4 were synthesized and evaluated for their opioid receptor affinity and activity. The L- and D-Homophe4 (homophenylalanine) analogues of [D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 were compared to the (R)- and (S)-Atc4 (2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid) derivatives (Aldrich et al. Chirality 2001, 13, 125-129). [l-Homophe4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the D-Homophe4 isomer, while [(R)-Atc4,D-Ala8]Dyn A-(1-11)NH2 exhibited higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity than the (S)-Atc4 isomer. Comparing the structure of Atc to those of Phe and Homophe, these results suggest that the Atc isomers are functioning more as constrained Homophe rather than Phe analogues in these Dyn A derivatives. The higher kappa-opioid receptor affinity of the (R)-Atc4 analogue suggests that Phe4 of Dyn A most likely adopts a gauche (-) or trans conformation in the kappa-opioid receptor binding site.

In an effort to understand the origin of the high potency, affinity, and selectivity of NTI, we have examined the conformational role of its indolic benzene moiety through the synthesis of related naltrexone derivatives 3-8, which contain the benzene moiety in different orientations and at different attachments in the molecule. One of these naltrexone derivatives, 5, whose 7-indanyl benzene moiety is orthogonal to ring C of the morphinan system, is a potent delta-opioid receptor antagonist in vitro and in vivo. Computer-assisted molecular overlay studies of the minimized structures (2-8) revealed the importance of the position of the benzene moiety for effective interaction with delta-opioid receptors. In compounds 2, 4, and 5, the aromatic ring falls in the same region of space as that of the indolic benzene moiety of NTI, and all of these ligands possessed significant activity at delta-opioid receptors.

Hydrophilic groups as determinants of selective antagonism of delta 1 opioid receptor-mediated antinociception in mice._||_Abstract: A series of amino acid conjugates (2-6) of naltrindole (1) were synthesized from 7'-carboxynaltrindole (7) in order to obtain delta antagonists that would have minimal access to the central nervous system (CNS) upon peripheral administration. All of the ligands (2-7) were tested in smooth muscle preparations and found to be potent and selective delta opioid antagonists. Receptor binding showed 2-7 to be highly delta-selective, with Ki ratios (mu/delta, kappa/delta) ranging from 127 to 38,000. Two of the more selective conjugates, the glycinate 2 and aspartate 3, were evaluated by the iv and icv routes in mice, and they afforded very high iv/icv dose ratios (112,766 and 46,667, respectively) consistent with poor CNS penetration. The in vivo testing revealed that 2 and 3 are delta 1-selective antagonists, in contrast to naltriben and related ligands which are delta 2-selective. The fact that the binding data are not consistent with the in vivo data suggests that the origin of the selectivity of naltrindole congeners may be related to selective access to tissue compartments in the CNS rather than to binding affinity differences between delta opioid receptor subtypes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL852686,20200703,5497186,103697951,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7853332,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

All analogues turned out to be potent kappa antagonists against Dyn A(1-13) and the non-peptide agonist U50,488 and showed only weak mu and delta antagonist activity. The most potent and most selective kappa antagonist of the series was [(2S)-Mdp(1)]Dyn A(1-11)-NH2 (5, dynantin), which showed subnanomolar kappa antagonist potency against Dyn A(1-13) and very high kappa selectivity both in terms of its K(e) values determined against kappa, mu, and delta agonists and in terms of its ratios of kappa, mu, and delta receptor binding affinity constants. Dynantin is the first potent and selective Dyn A-derived kappa antagonist known and may complement the non-peptide kappa antagonists norbinaltorphimine and GNTI as a pharmacological tool in opioid research.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850368,20181017,44334229,103321576,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11543672,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The potency and selectivity of these analogues were evaluated by bioassay in the mouse vas deference (MVD, delta receptor assay) and guinea pig ileum (GPI, mu receptor assay) assays and by radioreceptor binding assays in the rat brain using [3H]CTOP (mu ligand) and [3H][p-ClPhe4]DPDPE (delta ligand). The analogues showed highly variable potencies in the binding assays and in the bioassays. Aromatic ring substituents with positive Hammett constants had decreased potency, while substituents with negative Hammett constraints has increased potency for the opioid receptor. The most potent and most selective compound based on the binding was [2'-MeTyr1]DPDPE (IC50 = 0.89 nM and selectivity ratio 1310 in the binding assays). The 6-hydroxy-2-aminotetralin-2-carboxylic acid-containing analogue, [Hat1]DPDPE, also was highly potent and selective in both assays, demonstrating that significant modifications of tyrosine in enkephalins are possible with maintenance of high potency and delta opioid receptor selectivity. Of the beta-methyl-substituted Tyr1 analogues, [(2S,3R)-beta-MeTyr1]DPDPE was the most potent and the delta receptor selective.

W. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1983, 21, 307-312). Molecular modeling suggested that trans-4-aminocyclohexanecarboxylic acid (trans-ACCA) might function as a conformationally constrained replacement for Gly2-Gly3 of Dyn A in such an extended conformation. ACCA was synthesized by catalytic hydrogenation of p-aminobenzoic acid, and the cis and trans isomers were separated by fractional recrystallization. Analogues of Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 containing cis- and trans-ACCA were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using the Fmoc chemical protocol. Results from radioligand binding assays indicated that the peptides have modest affinity for kappa opioid receptors (Ki's = 9.1 and 13.4 nM for [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)NH2, respectively) and modest kappa-receptor selectivity (Ki ratio (kappa/mu/delta) = 1/13/210 and 1/21/103, respectively). [cis-ACCA2-3]- and [trans-ACCA2-3]Dyn A-(1-13)-NH2 are the first reported Dyn A analogues constrained in the 'message' sequence that are selective for kappa receptors.

The corresponding acetamide derivatives (5-7) also were synthesized to serve as nonelectrophilic controls.

The fact that the effect of 2 and 4 was found to increase as a function of time in MVD suggests a covalent mechanism for the wash resistant component. The m-isothiocyanate 3 was found to be a delta-selective and irreversible agonist in the MVD, and it is suggested that it may be covalently binding to an agonist recognition site.

In this effort, the rotational degrees of freedom of the N-substituent of 3 were limited by incorporation of an ethylene bridge between the piperidine 2- or 6-position of 3 and the benzylic position of the N-phenethyl moiety. The overall modification led to a novel series of fused bicyclic derivatives of the octahydroquinolizine chemical class, conformationally restricted analogue of 3.

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain.

In this concept, the bifunctional peptides were expected to interact with each receptor separately in the spinal dorsal horn where both the opioid receptors and the NK1 receptors were found to be expressed, to show an enhanced analgesic effect, no opioid-induced tolerance, and to provide better compliance than coadministration of two drugs. Compounds were synthesized using a two-step combinatorial method for C-terminal modification. In the method, the protected C-terminal-free carboxyl peptide, Boc-Tyr( tBu)- d-Ala-Gly Phe-Pro-Leu-Trp(Boc)-OH, was synthesized as a shared intermediate using Fmoc solid phase chemistry on a 2-chlorotrityl resin. This intermediate was esterified or amidated in solution phase. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) showed that the C-terminus acted as not only a critical pharmacophore for the substance P antagonist activities, but as an address region for the opioid agonist pharmacophore that is structurally distant from the C-terminal. Among the peptides, H-Tyr- d -Ala-Gly-Phe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bzl ( 3) demonstrated high binding affinities at both delta and mu receptors ( K i = 10 and 0.65 nM, respectively) with efficient agonist functional activity in the mouse isolated vas deferens (MVD) and guinea pig isolated ileum (GPI) assays (IC 50 = 50 and 13 nM, respectively). Compound 3 also showed a good antagonist activity in the GPI assay with substance P stimulation ( K e = 26 nM) and good affinity for the hNK1 receptor ( K i = 14 nM).

On the basis of its high delta selectivity, H-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH (reference compound 1) is a useful starting point for the synthesis of (18)F-labeled compounds prepared by the coupling of N-succinimidyl 4-[ (18)F]fluorobenzoate ([(18)F]SFB) with Boc-Dmt-Tic--Lys(Z)-OH under slightly basic conditions at 37 degrees C for 15 min, deprotection with TFA, and HPLC purification.

In vitro autoradiography studies showed prominent uptake of [ (18)F]- 1 in the striatum and cortex with significant blocking by 1 and UFP-501 (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), suggesting high specific binding of [(18)F]- 1 to delta-opioid receptors.

The activity of salvinorin A is unusual compared to other opioids such as morphine in that it mediates potent kappa opioid receptor signaling yet leads to less receptor downregulation than observed with other kappa agonists. Our initial chemical modifications of salvinorin A have yielded one analogue, herkinorin ( 1c), with high affinity at the microOR. We recently reported that 1c does not promote the recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the microOR or receptor internalization. Here we describe three new derivatives of 1c ( 3c, 3f, and 3i) with similar properties and one, benzamide 7b, that promotes recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the microOR and receptor internalization.

Many drug discovery programs have been based on the utilization of radioligand receptor binding technology to identify lead compounds which interact with receptors likely to be important in neuronal, immunological, gastrointestinal, and cardiovascular function/dysfunction. There are several obvious advantages to using in vitro receptor binding as a first level screen when compared to in vivo pharmacometric screens. Scientifically, the structure activity data generated in binding assays is a direct reflection of the ligand/receptor interaction minus the complications which result from secondary events, bioavailability, and pharmacodynamic issues. Technically, the binding studies require only a small amount of test compound (< or = 1 mg), while whole animal studies routinely need gram quantities. Similarly, only a small amount of tissue is required, compared with the cost of purchase and maintenance of live animals for in vivo screening. Supply and labor costs are drastically reduced due to the limited volume and test tube based technology of receptor binding. For these reasons receptor binding assays have been utilized with considerable success to discover site specific lead compounds in virtually every therapeutic area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1013977,20181024,5284596,103170037,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496700,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Inhibiting the formation of LTB 4 is expected to be beneficial in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), asthma, and atherosclerosis. We developed a pharmacophore model using a known inhibitor manually docked into the active site of LTA 4H to identify a subset of compounds for screening.

The series similarity to previously reported sigma ligands prompted analysis at sigma receptors to determine the SAR for affinity at sigma receptors. Within the N-substituent series the saturated analogs showed increased affinity at both sigma receptors. Optimal chain length in the N-arylalkyl series for sigma(1) and sigma(2) receptors proved to be N-propylphenyl; extension to a four carbon chain dramatically decreased affinity at both receptors. Substituents in the 4-position affect only sigma(1) affinity; no change in affinity at sigma(2) was shown. The N-isobutyl, N-phenylpropyl, and N-benzyl analogs are worth pursuing due to their good affinity and selectivity at the sigma(1) receptor, whereas the N-benzyl analog exhibits the greatest selectivity for sigma(1).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL995855,20181026,62513|191408|13046858|13599612|18997149|24885962|24885965|24886211|24886213,103628005|103628006|103628007|103628060|103628061|103628062|103628063|103628064|103628065,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17988766,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL
350954,Literature-derived,Inhibition of delta opioid receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022874,20180910,17758320,103530856,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Identification of novel and potent antitussive agents._||_Abstract: We have previously reported antitussive effects of naltrindole (NTI), a typical delta opioid receptor antagonist, in a rat model. The ED50 values of NTI by intraperitoneal and peroral injections were 104 microg/kg and 1840 microg/kg, respectively, comparable to those of codeine. Codeine, one of the most reliable centrally acting antitussive drugs, has micro agonist activity and thus the same side effects as morphine, e.g., constipation, dependency, and respiratory depression. Because NTI is a delta opioid antagonist, its derivatives have potential as highly potent antitussives, free from the mu opioid agonist side effects. We attempted to optimize the NTI derivatives to develop novel antitussive agents. On the basis of the studies of structure-antitussive activity relationships of alkyl substituted NTI derivatives, we designed NTI derivatives with extra ring fused structures. As a clinical candidate, we identified a highly potent new compound, (5R,9R,13S,14S)-17-cyclopropylmethyl-6,7-didehydro-4,5-epoxy-5',6'-dihydro-3-methoxy-4'H-pyrrolo[3,2,1-ij]quinolino[2',1':6,7]morphinan-14-ol (5b) methanesulfonate (TRK-850) which was effective even by oral administration (ED50 6.40 microg/kg).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL970716,20181026,5497186|15307413|24949529|24949532|24949683|24949684|24949687|24949689,103586336|103587313|103622354|103622355|103622440|103623454|103623455|103697951,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18637671,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

To identify a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors, we used the recently described conformation-state sensitive antibodies and screened a panel of endogenous peptides from rodent brain or adipose tissue. This led to the identification of hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH) as a peptide ligand that selectively binds CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. We find that hemopressin is a CB(1) receptor-selective antagonist, because it is able to efficiently block signaling by CB(1) receptors but not by other members of family A G protein-coupled receptors (including the closely related CB(2) receptors). Hemopressin also behaves as an inverse agonist of CB(1) receptors, because it is able to block the constitutive activity of these receptors to the same extent as its well characterized antagonist, rimonabant. Finally, we examine the activity of hemopressin in vivo using different models of pain and find that it exhibits antinociceptive effects when administered by either intrathecal, intraplantar, or oral routes, underscoring hemopressin's therapeutic potential.

This led to the identification of hemopressin (PVNFKFLSH) as a peptide ligand that selectively binds CB(1) cannabinoid receptors. We find that hemopressin is a CB(1) receptor-selective antagonist, because it is able to efficiently block signaling by CB(1) receptors but not by other members of family A G protein-coupled receptors (including the closely related CB(2) receptors). Hemopressin also behaves as an inverse agonist of CB(1) receptors, because it is able to block the constitutive activity of these receptors to the same extent as its well characterized antagonist, rimonabant. Finally, we examine the activity of hemopressin in vivo using different models of pain and find that it exhibits antinociceptive effects when administered by either intrathecal, intraplantar, or oral routes, underscoring hemopressin's therapeutic potential. These results represent a demonstration of a peptide ligand for CB(1) cannabinoid receptors that also exhibits analgesic properties. These findings are likely to have a profound impact on the development of novel therapeutics targeting CB(1) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL984601,20200703,172198|44560117,103583213|160704000,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18077343,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,45,,NULL

Although the differences in the primary sequence were limited to the C-terminus, the obtained NMR conformations were unexpectedly different for each compound. Moreover, their biological activities showed different trends in direct relation to the compound-specific conformations in DPC micelles. The important result is that not only were the NK1 antagonist activities different (the pharmacophore located at the C-terminus)but the opioid agonist activities (this pharmacophore was at the structurally preserved N-terminus) also were shifted, suggesting that a general conformational change in the bioactive state was induced due to relatively small and limited structural modifications.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1024703,20181026,5487663|16737673|25129133|25129135|44299404,103243877|103476010|103519857|103626264|103626265,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18821747,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640634,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

In the key step of the synthesis 2-bromocinnamaldehyde acetal 5 was added to piperidones 6 with various substituents at the N-atom. Unexpectedly, this reaction led to 2-benzoxepines 8, which were contracted with acid to afford the spirocyclic 2-benzofuranacetaldehydes 9. The best yields were obtained, when the transformations up to the alcohols 10 were performed without isolation of intermediates. Generally the (2-fluoroethyl) derivatives 3 have higher σ(1) affinity and σ(1)/σ(2) selectivity than the corresponding (3-fluoropropyl) derivatives 2. The most promising candidate for the development as radiotracer is the (2-fluoroethyl) derivative 3a (WMS-1828, fluspidine, 1'-benzyl-3-(2-fluoroethyl)-3H-spiro[[2]benzofuran-1,4'-piperidine]), which shows subnanomolar σ(1) affinity (K(i)=0.59nM) and excellent selectivity over the σ(2) subtype (1331-fold) as well as some other receptor systems. The novel synthetic strategy also allows the systematic pharmacological evaluation of intermediate alcohols 10. Despite their high σ(1) affinity (K(i)=6-32nM) and selectivity the alcohols 10 are 10-30-fold less potent than the bioisosteric fluoro derivatives 3.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1646513,20200626,50994498,124958368,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21126878,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Endogenous nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide and N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor [or opioid-receptor-like-1 (ORL1) receptor] are located in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the immune systems, and peripheral organs, and have a crucial role in the pain sensory system. Indeed, peripheral or intrathecal N/OFQ has displayed antinociceptive activities in neuropathic pain models, and inhibitory effects on pain-related neurotransmitter releases and on synaptic transmissions of C- and Aδ-fibers. In this study, design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationships of peripheral/spinal cord-targeting non-peptide NOP receptor agonist were investigated for the treatment of neuropathic pain, which resulted in the discovery of highly selective and potent novel NOP receptor full agonist {1-[4-(2-{hexahydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrol-2(1H)-yl}-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)piperidin-1-yl]cyclooctyl}methanol 1 (HPCOM) as systemically (subcutaneously) potent new-class analgesic. Thus, 1 demonstrates dose-dependent inhibitory effect against mechanical allodynia in chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain model rats, robust metabolic stability and little hERG potassium ion channel binding affinity, with its unique and potentially safe profiles and mechanisms, which were distinctive from those of N/OFQ in terms of site-differential effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1659156,20200626,16131448|49843555|53316968|53316969|53319615|53319616|53319617|53322245|53322246|53324890|53325608|53326167,103532611|124956810|124956811|124962100|124962101|124962102|124967393|124967394|124972650|124972651|124973921|124975252,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20875743,0,NULL,P41143,9606,198,,NULL

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects.

The presence of the Pro(2) represents a crucial factor for the ligand structural and conformational properties. Proline is in fact an efficient stereochemical spacer, capable of inducing favorable spatial orientation of aromatic rings, a key factor for ligand recognition and interaction with receptors. Here the Pro(2) has been replaced by 4(S)-NH(2)-2(S)-proline (cAmp), a proline/GABA cis-chimera residue. This bivalent amino acid maintains the capacity to influenc the tetrapeptide conformation and offers the opportunity to generate new linear models and unusually constrained cyclic analogues characterized by an N-terminal Tyr bearing a free α-amino group. The results indicate that the new analogues do not show affinity for both δ and κ opioid receptors and bind only poorly to the μ receptors (for cyclopeptide 9: K(i)(μ) = 660 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 1.4% at 1 μM; for linear tetrapeptide acid 13: K(i)(μ) = 2000 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 0% at 1 μM; for linear tetrapeptide amide 15: K(i)(μ) = 310 nM; GPI (IC(50)) = 894 nM).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2049660,20200627,57385006|70684123|70686263,160674315|160679653|160685014,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22394120,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The arylsulfanyl pyrazolone (ASP) scaffold was one of the active scaffolds identified in a cell-based high throughput screening assay targeting mutant Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) induced toxicity and aggregation as a marker for ALS. The initial ASP hit compounds were potent and had favorable ADME properties but had poor microsomal and plasma stability. Here, we identify the microsomal metabolite and describe synthesized analogues of these ASP compounds to address the rapid metabolism. Both in vitro potency and pharmacological properties of the ASP scaffold have been dramatically improved via chemical modification to the corresponding sulfone and ether derivatives. One of the ether analogues (13), with superior potency and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties, was tested in vivo for its pharmacokinetic profile, brain penetration, and efficacy in an ALS mouse model. The analogue showed sustained blood and brain levels in vivo and significant activity in the mouse model of ALS, thus validating the new aryloxanyl pyrazolone scaffold as an important novel therapeutic lead for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167438,20180923,45102767,136923905,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22191331,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

Their binding and functional activity, metabolic stability, and antinociceptive activity were determined and compared. Most of these analogues showed high affinities for the μ-opioid receptor and an increased stability in mouse brain homogenates compared with EM-1. Examination of cAMP accumulation and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEK293 cells confirmed the agonist properties of these analogues. Among these new analogues, H-Tyr-Pro-Trp-(2-furyl)Map-NH(2) (analogue 12) exhibited the highest binding potency (K(i)(μ) = 0.221 nM) and efficacy (EC(50) = 0.0334 nM, E(max) = 97.14%). This analogue also displayed enhanced antinociceptive activity in vivo in comparison to EM-1.

The value of the adamantyl group in drug design is multidimensional. The hydrophobic substituent constant for the adamantyl group has been estimated from the calculated partition coefficients (clogP values) of 31 adamantyl-bearing compounds in the clinic or in development as πadamantyl=3.1, which indicates that the logP value of a compound with high water solubility (logP<<0) could be moved with an adamantyl-based modification to a region that is more clinically useful. The steric bulk of the adamantyl group can: (i) restrict or modulate intramolecular reactivity; and (ii) impede the access of hydrolytic enzymes, thereby increasing drug stability and plasma half life. The value of the adamantyl group in drug design has been recognized most recently in the design of agents to treat iron overload disease (in development), malaria (in clinical trials) and type 2 diabetes (in the clinic).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2174529,20200625,10529438,103390432,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21354674,0,NULL,P41143,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Thus, eight more analogues with different absolute configuration at the chiral center of the aromatic residues in positions 3 and 4 have been synthesized and their opioid activity examined.

The structure of compound 1 comprises a hydroxycyclopentenone ring instead of the furanone ring characteristic for phthalides and represents a new carbon arrangement within polyketides. In the epimeric compounds 5a and 5b the phthalide (=isobenzofuranone) nucleus is modified to an isobenzofuran ring with ketal and acetal functionalities. Biosynthetically the structural skeletons of cyclomarinone (1) and maristachones A (2), C (4), D (5a), and E (5b) are most unusual due to the presence of an additional carbon atom when compared to the basic polyketide skeleton. This special biosynthetic feature also holds true for the likewise isolated polyketide marilactone (6).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2341825,20180926,71658646,164138116,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23268694,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

Members of the orvinol series of ligands are known for their high binding affinity to both KOR and MOR, but efficacy at the individual receptors has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this study, it is shown that a predictive model for efficacy at KOR can be derived, with efficacy being controlled by the length of the group attached to C20 and by the introduction of branching into the side chain.

A series of 14-O-substituted naltrexone derivatives were identified as potent mu opioid receptor (MOR) antagonists with improved selectivity over the kappa opioid receptor (KOR) and the delta opioid receptor (DOR), compared to naltrexone. Since esters are not metabolically very stable under typical physiological conditions, their corresponding amide analogs were thus synthesized and biologically evaluated. Unlike their isosteres, most of these novel ligands seem to be dually selective for the MOR and the KOR over the DOR. The restricted flexibility of the amide bond linkage might be responsible for their altered selectivity profile. However, the majority of the 14-N-substituted naltrexone derivatives produced marginal or no MOR stimulation in the (35)S-GTP[γS] assay, which resembled their ester analogs. The current study thus indicated that the 14-substituted naltrexone isosteres are not bioisosteres since they have distinctive pharmacological profile with the regard to their opioid receptor binding affinity and selectivity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399074,20200629,5360515|68867300|71680922|71680923|71680924|71681076|71681077|71681078|71681079,131283791|174491695|174491696|174496752|174507179|174512307|174517359|174517360|174522568,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23721804,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The affinity of the 5-phenylmorphans for opioid receptors is increased by a C8-methyl substituent, compared with its C7 analog. The affinity of the newly synthesized compounds is generally for the μ-opioid receptor, rather than the δ- or κ-receptors. Addition of a new cyclohexane ring to the C7 and C8 positions on the cyclohexane ring of the 5-phenylmorphans enhances μ-receptor affinity, bringing the Ki to the subnanomolar level. Unexpectedly, the N-methyl substituted compounds generally had higher affinity than comparable N-phenethyl-substituted relatives.

Nociceptin appears to regulate a host of physiological functions such as biological reactions to stress, anxiety, mood, and drug abuse, in addition to feeding behaviors. To develop tools to study the function of nociceptin and NOP receptor, our research effort sought to identify orally available NOP antagonists. Our effort led to the discovery of a novel chemical series based on the dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran) scaffold. Herein we show that dihydrospiro(piperidine-4,7'-thieno[2,3-c]pyran)-derived compounds are potent NOP antagonists with high selectivity versus classical opioid receptors (μ, δ, and κ).

Low-energy conformers of carbinol substituents on C7-C19-R1R2OH are found with and without intramolecular hydrogen bonding to the C6-OCH3 group. The relative energies of these conformers depend on the R1 and R2 groups and the diastereoisomerism of the alcohol. The results are consistent with available NMR and IR studies of intramolecular hydrogen bonding and with crystallographic data. The importance of interaction between specific conformations of C19 carbinols and a lipophilic receptor site is suggested. A hypothesis is formulated to explain observed differences in pharmacological activity between diastereoisomers at C19 in the oripavine series and also to explain how these diastereoisomers alter the established pattern of N-substituent effects on relative agonist/antagonist potency found in other rigid opiates. By contrast, conformational studies of the C19 optical isomers of the C7-C8 etheno form of buprenorphine lead to the prediction of greatly reduced intrinsic potency differences between C19 diastereoisomers for this compound and for buprenorphine itself.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3285643,20200618,90678812|90678814,242640974|242640976,4985|4986|4988,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,458815,0,NULL,P35372|P41143|P41145,9606,NULL,,NULL

As an approach to reducing side effects associated with κ opioid agonists, a series of β-naltrexamides 3-10 was synthesized in an effort to selectively target putative κ opioid heteromers without recruiting β-arrestin upon activation. The most potent derivative 3 (INTA) strongly activated KOR-DOR and KOR-MOR heteromers in HEK293 cells. In vivo studies revealed 3 to produce potent antinociception, which, when taken together with antagonism data, was consistent with the activation of both heteromers. 3 was devoid of tolerance, dependence, and showed no aversive effect in the conditioned place preference assay. As immunofluorescence studies indicated no recruitment of β-arrestin2 to membranes in coexpressed KOR-DOR cells, this study suggests that targeting of specific putative heteromers has the potential to identify leads for analgesics devoid of adverse effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3371071,20200623,102340665,312351639,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24978316,0,NULL,P41143,9606,45,,NULL

The study yielded compounds with good affinity and moderate to potent antagonist activity at the μ- and δ-opioid receptors, and agonist activity at the κ-opioid receptor. An N-allyl substituent in the C4a phenylpropyl series induced 6-fold higher affinity at δ-than μ-receptors, while an N-CPM substituent in the C4a (CH2)3Ph series led to a compound with high δ-affinity and potent δ-antagonist activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3413592,20200625,118731405|118731406|118731407|118731408|118731409|118731410|118731411|118731414|118731415|118731416|118731419|118731422|118731423|118731424|118731425|118731427,312385427|312385428|312385429|312385430|312385431|312385432|312385433|312385436|312385437|312385438|312385441|312385444|312385445|312385446|312385447|312385449,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25599950,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

Recent studies suggested that mGluR1 is associated with chronic pain and can serve as a promising target for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In an effort to develop a novel mGluR1 antagonist, we designed and synthesized a library of compounds with tetrahydrothieno[2,3-c]pyridine scaffold. Among these compounds, compound 9b and 10b showed excellent antagonistic activity in vitro and demonstrated pain-suppressing activity in animal models of pain. Both compounds were orally active, and compound 9b exhibited a favorable pharmacokinetic profile in rats. We believe that these compounds can provide a promising lead compound that is suitable for the potential treatment of neuropathic pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3424062,20181006,118735958,312391868,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25984841,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

Recently our group reported novel 4-anilidopiperidine analogues, in which several aromatic ring-contained amino acids were conjugated with N-phenyl-N-(piperidin-4-yl)propionamide and examined their biological activities at the μ and δ opioid receptors. In continuation of our efforts in these novel 4-anilidopiperidine analogues, we took a peptidomimetic approach in the present design, in which we substituted aromatic amino acids with tetrahydronaphthalen-2yl methyl moiety with amino, amide and hydroxyl substitutions at the 5th position. In in vitro assays these ligands, showed very good binding affinity and highly selective toward the μ opioid receptor. Among these, the lead ligand 20 showed excellent binding affinity (2 nM) and 5000 fold selectivity toward the μ opioid receptor, as well as functional selectivity in GPI assays (55.20 ± 4.30 nM) and weak or no agonist activities in MVD assays. Based on the in vitro bioassay results the lead compound 20 was chosen for in vivo assessment for efficacy in naïve rats after intrathecal administration. Compound 20 was not significantly effective in alleviating acute pain. This discrepancy between high in vitro binding affinity, moderate in vitro activity, and low in vivo activity may reflect differences in pharmacodynamics (i.e., engaging signaling pathways) or pharmacokinetics (i.e., metabolic stability). In sum, our data suggest that further optimization of this compound 20 is required to enhance in vivo activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3614305,20200624,122189395|122189397|122189398|122189399|122189401|122189403|122189404|122189405|122189407|122189409,318388416|318388417|318388418|318388419|318388420|318388421|318388422|318388423|318388424|318388425,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26299827,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The design of non-peptide analogues is explored with 5-amino substituted (tetrahydronaphthalen-2yl) methyl containing 4-anilidopiperidine derivatives, while non-peptide-peptide ligands are explored by conjugating the C-terminus of enkephalin analogues (H-Xxx-DAla-Gly-Phe-OH) to the amino group of 4-anilidopiperidine small molecule derivatives with and without a linker. These novel bivalent ligands are evaluated for biological activities at μ and δ opioid receptors. They exhibit very good affinities at μ and δ opioid receptors, and potent agonist activities in MVD and GPI assays. Among these the lead bivalent ligand 17 showed excellent binding affinities (0.1 nM and 0.5 nM) at μ and δ opioid receptors respectively, and was found to have very potent agonist activities in MVD (56 ± 5.9 nM) and GPI (4.6 ± 1.9 nM) assays. In vivo the lead bivalent ligand 17 exhibited a short duration of action (<15 min) comparable to 4-anilidopiperidine derivatives, and moderate analgesic activity.

These peptide-based ligands are anticipated to produce better biological profiles (e.g., higher analgesic effect with significantly less adverse side effects) compared to those of existing drugs and to deliver better synergistic effects than coadministration of a mixture of multiple drugs. A systematic structure-activity relationship (SAR) study has been conducted to find multifunctional ligands with desired activities at three receptors. It has been found that introduction of Dmt (2,6-dimethyl-tyrosine) at the first position and NMePhe at the fourth position (ligand 3: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-NMePhe-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) displays binding as well as functional selectivity for MOR over DOR while maintaining efficacy, potency, and antagonist activity at the NK1R. Dmt at the first position with Phe(4-F) at the fourth position (ligand 5: H-Dmt-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) exhibits balanced binding affinities at MOR and DOR though it has higher agonist activity at DOR over MOR. This study has led to the discovery of several novel ligands including 3 and 5 with excellent in vitro biological activity profiles. Metabolic stability studies in rat plasma with ligands 3, 5, and 7 (H-Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe(4-F)-Pro-Leu-Trp-NH-Bn(3',5'-(CF3)2)) showed that their stability depends on modifications at the first and fourth positions (3: T1/2 > 24 h; 5: T1/2 ≈ 6 h; 7: T1/2 > 2 h).

This study is centered on the design, synthesis, and pharmacological evaluation of fluorescent probes for the opioid receptors, for which relatively few non-peptidic fluorescent probes currently exist. The known μ-opioid receptor (MOR) partial agonist, buprenorphine, was structurally elaborated to include an amidoalkylamine linker moiety that was coupled with a range of fluorophores to afford new fluorescent probes. All compounds proved to be selective MOR antagonists. Confocal fluorescence microscopy studies revealed that the probe incorporating a sulfonated cyanine-5 fluorophore was the most appropriate for imaging studies.

Both bivalent ligand series exhibited remarkable binding affinities from nanomolar to subnanomolar range at both μ and δ opioid receptors and displayed potent agonist activities as well. The replacement of Tyr with Dmt and introduction of a linker between the small molecule and enkephalin analogue resulted in highly potent ligands.

In our further designs we replaced the (tetrahydronaphthalen-2-yl)methyl moiety with benzyl and phenethyl moiety. These N-phenyl-N-(piperidin-2-yl)propionamide analogues showed moderate to good binding affinities (850-4 nM) and were selective towards the μ opioid receptor over the δ opioid receptors. From the structure activity relationship studies, we found that a hydroxyl substitution at the 5th position of (tetrahydronapthalen-2yl)methyl group, ligands 19 and 20, showed excellent binding affinities 4 and 5 nM, respectively, and 1000 fold selectivity towards the μ opioid relative to the delta opioid receptor. The ligand 19 showed potent agonist activities 75±21 nM, and 190±42 nM in the GPI and MVD assays. Surprisingly the fluoro analogue 20 showed good agonist activities in MVD assays 170±42 nM, in contrast to its binding affinity results.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756647,20200623,3345|127037378|127037395|127037396|127037397|127037398|127037399|127037400,103182112|336885909|336885933|336885934|336885935|336885936|336885937|336885938,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26712115,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

1282708,Literature-derived,Binding affinity to opioid receptor (unknown origin) at 10 uM by radioligand binding assay,"Title: Potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors: Design and structure-activity relationship studies._||_Abstract: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) exert their pharmacological effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2. Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

The present review will focus on the contributions that a cyclopropyl ring makes to the properties of drugs containing it. Consequently, the cyclopropyl ring addresses multiple roadblocks that can occur during drug discovery such as (a) enhancing potency, (b) reducing off-target effects,",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3857937,20200624,5284594,103256810,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27299736,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

We recently reported lead compound 1 as a new class of κ opioid receptor antagonists with only one basic amine group. Analogues were synthesized and evaluated for their in vitro opioid receptor antagonist properties using a [35S]GTPγS binding assay. All analogues were pure opioid receptor antagonists with no agonist activity.

Ideally, these same receptors would also be absent, or minimally expressed, in healthy tissue. The mu (μ) and delta (δ) opioid receptors (MOR and DOR respectively) match these criteria, with expression in cancer cells that is higher than primary lung epithelial cells. Naltrexone is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of alcohol dependence or prevention of relapse from opioid addiction. Since naltrexone binds with high affinity to both MOR and DOR, it was selected as the platform for development of novel ligands capable of delivering a cytotoxic payload to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study outlines the synthesis of two ligands, with peptide or PEG linkers that were synthesized from 6-amino-naltrexone and conjugated with rhodamine dye or 99mTc for in vitro imaging, binding affinity or in vivo imaging and biodistribution studies. Transfected HEK cells were used as a model system for over-expression of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) or the δ-opioid receptor (DOR). Naltrexone and naltrindole were used as competition for MOR and DOR respectively during the binding affinity studies. Mice bearing a xenograft of HEK cells transfected with μ (HEK-mu) or δ (HEK-delta) opioid receptors were the animal model used for PET imaging and in vivo biodistribution studies. Although the binding affinity studies were encouraging, the biodistribution data for the selected conjugates lacked sufficient specificity.

This study expands the structure-activity relationships on our original series by presenting several modifications in the lead compounds 1 (HS665) and 2 (HS666). A library of new diphenethylamines was designed, synthesized, and pharmacologically evaluated. In comparison with 1 and 2, the KOP receptor affinity, selectivity, and agonist activity were modulated by introducing bulkier N-substituents, a 2-fluoro substitution, and additional hydroxyl groups at positions 3' and 4'. Several analogues showed subnanomolar affinity and excellent KOP receptor selectivity acting as full or partial agonists, and one as an antagonist.

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041172,20200621,72771081,242581035,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models.

Among all 37 synthesized compounds, two series were developed with the modulation of the nature, the position of atoms or groups on the benzamide scaffold, but also the nature of the amine group separated from the benzamide with 2, 3 or 4 methylene groups. In vitro competition binding assays against sigma proteins (sigma-1 S1R and sigma-2 S2R) revealed that most of them conferred S2R/S1R selectivity toward without cytotoxic effects on SY5Y cells, especially with the first series with compounds 7a-z. Some selected compounds were also evaluated for their agonist and antagonist activities on a panel of 40 receptors. Results showed the importance of the nature and the position with halogeno atom on the benzamide scaffold, the length chain but also the contribution of the hydrophobic part on the amine group. Among them, compounds 7i, w, y with Cl, CN or NO2 groups at the 4-position of the benzamide scaffold showed excellent affinity for S1R (Ki = 1.2-3.6 nM), selectivity for S2R (Ki up to 1400 nM) and high selectivity index (IC50(SY5Y)/Ki(S1R) ratio from 28 000 to 83 000).

It is the first report where potential anti-virulent agents were evaluated for inhibition of several virulence factors of PA. Finally, co-treatment with these inhibitors significantly reduced the production of virulence factors induced by the presence of sub-inhibitory levels of ciprofloxacin.

Three newly prepared opioid ligands, 25 (NBF), 31, and 38, were identified as potent MOR antagonists both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, these three compounds significantly antagonized DAMGO-induced intracellular calcium flux and displayed varying degrees of inhibition on cAMP production. Furthermore, NBF produced much less significant withdrawal effects than naloxone in morphine-pelleted mice. Molecular modeling studies revealed that these bivalent bioisosteres may adopt similar binding modes in the MOR and the 'address' portions of them may have negative or positive allosteric modulation effects on the function of their 'message' portions compared with NAN and INTA. Collectively, our successful application of the 'bivalent bioisostere concept' identified a promising lead to develop novel therapeutic agents toward opioid use disorder treatments.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4324923,20210302,155513829|155513884|155515703|155517330|155518912|155524409|155526173|155526451|155526658|155528037|155530150|155531529|155531666|155538316|155544775|155555908|155556076|155558236|155559127|155563763|155564087|155564346|155567280|155567972,440114747|440114823|440117589|440120012|440122421|440131018|440133708|440134144|440134458|440136575|440139827|440141872|440142086|440152231|440167527|440195615|440195982|440201347|440203590|440215263|440216049|440216668|440224242|440226003,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31782922,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

Since neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor antagonists reversed opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, the present work was performed to synthetize two branched peptidomimetics, EKR and RKE, containing the opioid peptide endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9. Our data obtained from the in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate experiment demonstrated that EKR functioned as a mixed mu-, delta-opioid receptors agonist and NPFF<sub>1</sub> receptor antagonist/NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor partial agonist, whereas RKE acted as a multi-functional peptidomimetic with the mu-opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism. Furthermore, EKR and RKE completely blocked the NPFF<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth of Neuro 2A cells. In vivo antinociception studies found that supraspinal administration of EKR and RKE dose-dependently produced potent antinociception via the mu-opioid receptor in the tail-flick test. In carrageenan inflammatory pain model, spinal administration of EKR and RKE induced dose-related analgesia, which was significantly reduced by the opioid antagonist naloxone and the NPFF antagonist RF9. Notably, compared with morphine, intracerebroventricular repeated administration of EKR and RKE maintained prolonged antinociceptive effectiveness. In addition, at the antinociceptive doses, these two branched peptidomimetics did not significantly inhibit gastrointestinal transit. Taken together, the present work suggest that EKR and RKE behave as multi-functional ligands with the opioid agonism and the NPFF<sub>1</sub> antagonism/NPFF<sub>2</sub> partial agonism, and produce prolonged antinociception with limited side effects. Moreover, our results imply that EKR and RKE might be interesting pharmacological tools for further investigating the biological function of the NPFF and opioid systems.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4333171,20210302,5311081|155515973|155520785,103347472|440118014|440125450,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30626554,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

SAR around the C-3 substituents investigated effects on NOP binding, intrinsic activity, and selectivity and showed that while the C(3)-substituted indoles are selective, high affinity NOP ligands, the steric, polar, and cationic nature of the C-3 substituents affected intrinsic activity to afford partial agonists with a range of efficacies.

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396146,20210302,155565189,440218835,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

In particular, a F-atom was introduced in β- or γ-position of the 4-phenylbutyl side chain in 3-position. Ligands with the F-atom in γ-position possess higher GluN2B affinity than analogs bearing the F-atom in β-position. This effect was attributed to the reduced basicity of β-fluoro amines. 3-Benzazepines with a benzylic OH moiety show moderate GluN2B affinity, but considerable selectivity over the σ<sub>2</sub> receptor. However, removal of the benzylic OH moiety led to increased GluN2B affinity, but reduced GluN2B/σ<sub>2</sub> selectivity. With respect to GluN2B affinity the phenol 17b with a γ-fluorophenylbutyl moiety in 3-position represents the most interesting fluorinated ligand (K<sub>i</sub>(GluN2B) = 16 nM).

New benzomorphan derivatives, analogues of LP1, a multitarget MOR agonist/DOR antagonist, were designed to examine in depth MOR ligand binding domain. Compound 5, bearing a diphenylic N-substituent on the benzomorphan nucleus, showed an affinity (K<sub>i</sub><sup>μ</sup>=0.5±0.2nM) comparable to that of LP1 and a better selectivity versus DOR and KOR. It elicits antinociceptive effects in ex vivo (GPI) and in vivo. This new compound engages receptor amino acidic residues not reached by LP1 and by other established MOR ligands. Molecular modeling studies, conducted on 5 and on several reference compounds, allowed us to propose possible residues in the MOR ligand binding domain essential for their interactions with 'orthosteric' and 'allosteric' binding sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4430770,20210302,104787|3036289|5462471|123445395|155515838|155522689|155530357|155553117|155558752|155563934,103202725|103217856|123099351|336866137|440117795|440128385|440140127|440188464|440202620|440215673,4985,NULL,P41143,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27624520,0,NULL,P41143,9606,197,,NULL

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent.

1921,Other,Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Colleen Niswender_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator(PAM)_||_Grant Number: MH077607-1_||_To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

Upon agonist-mediated GPCR activation, the arrestin-GFP redistributes from the cytosolic compartment to the plasma membrane and further to coated pits / endosomal vesicles, which can be quantified as increased local aggregation of the GFP-arrestins.",14,Burnham Center for Chemical Genomics,SBCCG-A464-DOR-Antagonist-DryPowder-Assay-3,20110401,3342390|6621922|22522557|22522715|22553408|22553432|22553433|22553442|22553447|22553448|22553452|22553453|44608027|44608028|44608029|44608030|44608031|44608033|44608034|44608035|44608036|44608037|44608038|44608039|44620896|44620897|44620898|44620899|44620900|44620901|44620902|44620903|44620904|44620905|44620906|44620907|44620908|44620909|44620910|44665679|44665680|44665681|44665682|44665683|44665684|44665685|44665686|44665687|44665688|44665689|44828476|44828477|44828478|44828479|44828480|45100474|45100475|45100476|45100477|45115585|45115586|45115587|45115588|45115589|45115590|45115591|45115592|45115593|45115594|45479160|45479161|45479162|45479163|45479164|45479165|45479166|45479167|45479168|45479169|45479170|45479171|46863874,87457826|87457827|87457828|87457829|87457830|87457831|87457832|87457833|87457834|87457835|87457836|87457837|87457838|87544125|87544126|87544127|87544128|87544129|87544130|87544131|87544132|87544133|87544134|87544135|87544136|87544137|87544138|87544139|87544140|87544471|87544472|87544473|87544474|87544475|87544476|87544477|87544478|87544479|87544480|88442991|88442992|88442993|88442994|88442995|88442996|88442997|88442998|88442999|88443000|88443001|90340550|90340551|90340552|90340553|90340554|90340555|92093149|92093150|92093151|92093152|92310204|92310205|92310206|92310207|92310208|92310209|92310210|92310211|92310212|92310213|93575674|93575675|93575676|93575677|93575678|93575679|93575680|93575681|93575682|93575683|93575684|93575685|93575686,4985,NULL,NP_000902,NIH Initiatives,10471416,0,NULL,P41143,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_Summary of Probe Development Effort:_||_This probe development effort is focused on the identification of agonists of heterodimerization of the mu 1 (OPRM1) and delta 1 (OPRD1) opioid receptors.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.

1788,Other,Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor: Agonist Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: P. Jeffrey Conn_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor_||_Grant Number: 1 R03 MH077606-01_||_The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively modulate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_Summary of Probe Development Effort:_||_This probe development effort is focused on the identification of inverse agonists of heterodimerization of the mu 1 (OPRM1) and delta 1 (OPRD1) opioid receptors.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use. The goal of this project is identification of HTR5A inverse agonists._||_References:_||_1. Raehal KM, Bohn LM. Mu opioid receptor regulation and opiate responsiveness.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

However, it has recently been demonstrated that GPCRs do not only signal in this simplistic fashion, but rather activate a network of downstream effects comprised of parallel signal transduction pathways. GPCR ligands biased towards induction or blockade of specific signaling pathways may have different physiology compared with unbiased molecules, through selective engagement of a desired subset of signal cascades. For example, the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) transduces its signal via coupling to Gs and adenylyl cyclase activation, and is involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis and chronic disease-associated cachexia. Recent studies indicate that classical antagonists do not mimic MC4R regulation by its endogenous ligand, Agouti-Related Protein (AgRP). Indeed, AgRP has several actions including antagonizing Gs-mediated adenylyl cyclase activation, inducing beta-arrestin recruitment and MC4R endocytosis (5), as well as stimulating Gi-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (6). As a result, the identification of small molecules that act as biased MC4R ligands, by blocking Gs protein coupling but stimulating beta-arrestin functions and/or Gi protein coupling, may lead to a better understanding of this receptor and its role in metabolic/wasting diseases._||_References:_||_1.

The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1). Due to their clinical importance, various strategies have been considered for making opiates more effective while curbing liabilities such as addiction. One such strategy has been to use a combination of drugs to improve the effectiveness of morphine. The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

However, their long-term use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence, as well as respiratory suppression and constipation (1).

The OPRM1 gene encodes the mu opioid receptor, which is the primary site of action for morphine (2) and other commonly used opioid such as heroin, fentanyl, and methadone. OPRM1 activation and subsequent dissociation of the Gi/Go G-proteins results in reduction of adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP production (3). There are at least two other types of opioid receptors: delta (OPRD1) and kappa (OPRK1), each with a distinct pharmacologic profile. In particular, delta (OPRD1) opioid receptor ligands have been useful in enhancing morphine's potency, but the underlying molecular basis is not understood (4). It has been shown that modulation of receptor function by physical association between mu and delta opioid receptors is a potential mechanism (5). The assay provider has previously found that a combination of OPRM1 agonist with OPRD1 antagonist selectively activates the OPRM1-OPRD1 heteromer (5) and recently showed that this could be blocked by antibodies that selectively recognize the heteromer (6). Since OPRD1 antagonist have anxiogenic effects, these are not ideal as therapies. Hence, the identification of compounds that selectively activate mu-delta opioid receptor heterodimerization may have potential in the treatment of pain and alleviate unwanted effects associated with opiate use._||_References:_||_1.

Studies have identified a role for dynorphin and OPRK stimulation in neuropathic pain (1). The dynorphins act as endogenous agonists at the opioid receptors, including OPRK (2), and the increased dynorphin expression in neuropathic pain also leads to a sustained activation of OPRK (1, 3). The mechanisms and neural circuits in OPRK-mediated analgesia are active areas of study; it is hoped those studies will assist in the development of novel analgesics that bypass OPRK-mediated depression (4-5). A role for dynorphin/OPRK in modulating drug addiction has been proposed (for review, see (6-7)). The function of dynorphin/OPRK systems in addiction appears to be diverse, and may modulate drug-seeking behavior depending on factors such as drug history, pattern of intake, and stress (for review, see (6)). The availability of potent and selective OPRK ligands may help unravel these mechanisms, as well as prove to be of therapeutic utility. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that the dynorphin/OPRK system may be dysregulated in affective psychiatric disorders (for review, see (6, 8)). However, solid evidence from clinical studies is lacking. There is increasing evidence for a potential involvement of dynorphin/OPRK in schizophrenia; OPRK agonists appear to induce symptoms in humans and animals that are present in schizophrenia (8-10). Thus, the availability of new research tools such as potent and selective OPRK antagonists will facilitate understanding the physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms of dynorphin/OPRK systems and their roles in psychiatric disease in humans._||_References:_||_1.
