Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives._||_Abstract: The conformationally restricted linear tricyclic analogs of 5- and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralins were investigated for their serotonergic and dopaminergic properties. These cis and trans analogs of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole (3), where a five-membered ring is fused between the nitrogen and C-3 carbon of 2-aminotetralin, were synthesized from 5-methoxy- and 8-methoxytetralones. The enantiomers of trans-5-methoxy-N-n-propyl and -N-allyl analogs were obtained via fractional recrystallization of their di-p-toluoyl-L (or D) tartaric acid salts. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests. In the 5-substituted series (R1 in 3), the trans isomers were found to possess higher levels of pharmacological activity then the corresponding cis isomers. The trans-5-methoxy analogs showed selective 5-HT1A receptor activity in vitro but displayed mixed 5-HT1A and D2 agonist properties in vivo. The corresponding trans-5-hydroxy analogs were found to be potent D2 agonists with full intrinsic activity. An examination of nitrogen substitution (R2 in 3) revealed that analogs with either an allyl or an n-propyl group displayed equipotent activities. Substitution with a cyclopropylmethyl or benzyl group resulted in reduced activity. Among the resolved analogs tested, the activity was found to reside exclusively in the (3aS)-(-)-enantiomers. In the 8-substituted series (R1 in 3), only 8-methoxy-N-allyl analogs were synthesized and evaluated. In this case, both cis and trans isomers showed equally weak in vitro 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity devoid of dopaminergic effects. The presence of an additional methyl group at the C-2 position (R3 in 3) of the cis-(+/-)-8-methoxy-N-n-propyl analog resulted in enhancement of in vitro 5-HT1A receptor binding affinity, with the (2 beta,3a alpha,9a alpha)-(+/-)-isomer displaying potency 35 times greater than the (2 alpha,3a alpha,9a alpha)-(+/-)-isomer.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL659149,20181014,10014057|10036887|10105311|10355219|10377224|10398936|10444473|11776081,103171762|103171763|103171823|103171824|103171858|103171864|103171983|103171989,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097538,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL
45419,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]spiperone from CHO-K1 cell membranes expressing human dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Evaluation of the effects of the enantiomers of reduced haloperidol, azaperol, and related 4-amino-1-arylbutanols on dopamine and sigma receptors._||_Abstract: The enantiomers of reduced haloperidol (3a), azaperol (3b), and the related compound BMY-14802 (3c) were prepared in high optical purity. The affinity of these compounds for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and sigma S1 and S2 sites was determined in vitro. Both enantiomers of 3a display greatly decreased affinity for D2 and D3 receptors compared to haloperidol, although they still possess affinities in the 100-200-nM range. Both enantiomers of 3a possess potent and equal affinity for S1 sites (Ki: 1-2 nM), only slightly weaker than haloperidol (Ki: 0.33 nM). At S2 sites, (R)-(+)-3a displays similar affinity to haloperidol (Ki: 31 and 26 nM, respectively), while (S)-(-)-3a is slight more potent (Ki: 8.2 nM). The stereoselectivity profile of the enantiomers of 3b at D2 and D3 receptors is quite similar to that of 3a, (S)-(-)-3b being about 4 times more potent than its enantiomer at both receptors. (R)-(+)-3b binds preferentially to sigma S1 over S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3b displays the opposite selectivity profile. Both enantiomers of 3c possess very weak affinity for D2 and D3 receptors. In a manner similar to the enantiomers of 3b, the affinity of (R)-(+)-3c is greater for S1 than S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3c displays the opposite selectivity profile. Following parenteral administration of both enantiomers of 3a, dopamine synthesis and turnover in rat striatum, cortex, and mesolimbic areas were increased, in a manner similar to the effects produced by haloperidol itself. Additional studies will be required to assess with certainty whether the effects were due to the compounds themselves or simply were a consequence of the in vivo oxidation to haloperidol.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL651364,20181014,3559|15443|6604868|10020651|16048564|24867245|44350942|44350991,103167216|103359590|103359652|103359654|103359671|103359710|103359798|103359799,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7902870,0,NULL,P14416,9606,198,,NULL

Certain of the 2-aminoindan derivatives displayed pharmacologic properties consistent with their being dopaminergic agonists. The beta-phenethylamine derivative did not show any significant dopamine-like activity. The 7-hydroxy-8-methyloctahydrobenzo[f]quinoline derivative 4a was a moderately potent, short-acting DA2 receptor antagonist. All of the carboxylic acid derivatives were inert. Of the ortho hydroxy/methyl derivatives, only the 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-aminotetralin derivative displayed pharmacological properties consistent with its being a dopaminergic prodrug. It is concluded that 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (1a) is structurally unique for a dopaminergic drug.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL661208,20200628,6005|145954|10083326|44303823|44303825|44303826|44303827|44303828|44303830|44303832|44303845|44303865|44303869|44303870|44303872|44304062,103167211|103252888|103252908|103252910|103252911|103252912|103252913|103252915|103252916|103252937|103252957|103252961|103252962|103252963|103252965|103253393,1812|1813|1814|1815|1816,NULL,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,3761320,0,NULL,P14416|P21728|P21917|P21918|P35462,9685,NULL,,NULL

Study of the physicochemical influence of the pharmacophore on 5-HT(1a)/alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor affinity: synthesis of a new derivative with mixed 5-HT(1a)/d(2) antagonist properties._||_Abstract: In this paper we have designed and synthesized a test series of 32 amide arylpiperazine derivatives VI in order to gain insight into the physicochemical influence of the pharmacophores of 5-HT(1A) and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors. The training set was designed applying a fractional factorial design using six physicochemical descriptors. The amide moiety is a bicyclohydantoin or a diketopiperazine (X = -(CH(2))(3)-, -(CH(2))(4)-; m = 0, 1), the spacer length is 3 or 4 methylene units, which are the optimum values for both receptors, and the aromatic substituent R occupies the ortho- or meta-position and has been selected from a database of 387 substituents using the EDISFAR program. The 5-HT(1A) and alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor binding affinities of synthesized compounds VI (1-32) have been determined. This data set has been used to derive classical quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) and neural networks models for both receptors (following paper). A comparison of these models gives information for the design of the new ligand EF-7412 (46) (5-HT(1A): K(i) = 27 nM; alpha(1): K(i) > 1000 nM). This derivative displays affinity for the dopamine D(2) receptor (K(i) = 22 nM) and is selective versus all other receptors examined (5-HT(2A), 5-HT(3), 5-HT(4) and Bz; K(i) > 1000 nM). EF-7412 (46) acts as an antagonist in vivo in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT(1A) receptor sites and as an antagonist in the dopamine D(2) receptor. Thus, EF-7412 (46) is a derivative with mixed 5-HT(1A)/D(2) antagonist properties and this derivative could be useful as a pharmacological tool.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL664619,20181017,52941718,104236689,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11170628,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The addition of various nucleophiles to (R)-lambda1,11-carbonylaporphine [(R)-11] or to the 1,11-hydroxymethyleneaporphine epimers gave separable mixtures of epimers. The epimeric ratios obtained in most reactions seem to be a result of steric factors directing the nucleophilic attack. The structure of the epimers was determined by a combination of X-ray crystallography (5 derivatives), NMR spectroscopy, and chemical correlation. Interesting and diverse pharmacological profiles of the derivatives were revealed through binding studies at serotonin 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(1A) receptors as well as at dopamine D(2A) receptors. Two derivatives appeared to be selective 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists.

It was found that modification of the 2-methoxy substituent of metoclopramide was detrimental to dopaminergic D2 antagonism but not necessarily to antagonism of cisplatin-induced emesis. A number of analogues having a beta-keto, beta-hydroxy, beta-methoxy, beta-imino, or beta-unsaturated alkyloxy substituent instead of methoxy have shown equal or superior protection from emesis to that of metoclopramide.

Structural modifications of N- and C-linked (principally hydantoin) analogues at the 5-position were synthesized and their pharmacological activities were utilized to deduce significant steric and electrostatic requirements of the 5-HT1D and 5-HT2A receptor subtypes. Conformations of the active molecules were computed which, when overlaid, suggested a pharmacophore hypothesis which was consistent with the affinity and selectivity measured at 5-HT1D and 5-HT2A receptors. This pharmacophore is composed of a protonated amine site, an aromatic site, a hydrophobic pocket, and two hydrogen-bonding sites. A 'selectivity site' was also identified which, if occupied, induced sensitivity for 5-HT1D over 5-HT2A in this series of molecules. The development and use of the pharmacophore models in compound design is described. In addition, the physicochemical constraints of molecular size and hydrophobicity required for efficient oral absorption are discussed.

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model.

61461,Confirmatory,Inhibitor constant of compound for high affinity component of [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine binding to Dopamine receptor D2 in absence of Gpp(NH)p (pretreatment with 100 nM of compound),"Title: Design, synthesis, and dopamine receptor modulating activity of spiro bicyclic peptidomimetics of L-prolyl-L-leucyl-glycinamide._||_Abstract: In the present study, the synthesis of the 5.5.6. and 5.6.5. spiro bicyclic lactam PLG peptidomimetics, compounds 3 and 4, respectively, was undertaken. These peptidomimetics were designed to examine the following: (1) the effect that changing the size of the thiazolidine and lactam ring systems would have on the ability of these systems to mimic the type-II beta-turn and (2) the effect that these structural perturbations would have on the ability of the peptidomimetics to modulate dopamine receptors. Through the use of the [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) dopamine D2 receptor competitive binding assay, 3 and 4, at a concentration of 100 nM, decreased the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor for the agonist. These effects were observed when either Gpp(NH)p was absent or present and they were comparable to those produced by PLG at a concentration of 1 microM. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 also increased the percentage of D2 receptors that existed in the high-affinity state. Even with Gpp(NH)p present, 3 and 4 were able to return the RH/RL ratios to values observed in the respective controls where Gpp(NH)p was absent.

These peptidomimetics were designed to examine the following: (1) the effect that changing the size of the thiazolidine and lactam ring systems would have on the ability of these systems to mimic the type-II beta-turn and (2) the effect that these structural perturbations would have on the ability of the peptidomimetics to modulate dopamine receptors. Through the use of the [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) dopamine D2 receptor competitive binding assay, 3 and 4, at a concentration of 100 nM, decreased the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor for the agonist. These effects were observed when either Gpp(NH)p was absent or present and they were comparable to those produced by PLG at a concentration of 1 microM. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 also increased the percentage of D2 receptors that existed in the high-affinity state. Even with Gpp(NH)p present, 3 and 4 were able to return the RH/RL ratios to values observed in the respective controls where Gpp(NH)p was absent. Furthermore, both peptidomimetics were able to attenuate the Gpp(NH)p-induced shift to the low-affinity state to a greater extent than PLG.

Optimization of in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo activity in rodent models of psychosis has led to compound 24, which showed good affinities for human D(2), D(3), and 5-HT(1A) receptors but significantly less affinity for human alpha(1) adrenoceptors and rat H(1) and muscarinic receptors. In rodents, 24 showed functional D(2)-like antagonism and 5-HT(1A) partial agonism. After oral dosing, 24 showed good activity in rodent antipsychotic tests and very little potential to cause extrapyramidal side effects (EPS), as measured by its ability to induce catalepsy in rats only at very high doses. In the light of this promising profile of activity, 24 has been selected for clinical investigation as a novel antipsychotic agent with a predicted low propensity to cause EPS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL669156,20181016,9865858,103337393,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10464021,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Compound 15 (DuP 734) is a combined antagonist of sigma-1 and serotonin 5HT2 receptors, which has been entered into phase I clinical trials as a potential antipsychotic drug. Tetralins 1 and 2 were prepared to determine whether restriction of the conformation of 15 and its analogs may lead to differences in binding selectivity or in vivo profile. The syntheses and the structure-activity relationships of these compounds are reported herein. A reduced derivative, 14, had high affinity for sigma-1 and serotonin 5HT2 receptors as well as excellent oral activity in some animal antipsychotic models.

The structure-activity relationships surrounding this compound were studied by synthesis of analogues and evaluation of their dopaminergic activity. The cyclohexene substitution pattern was varied along with the length of the chain connecting the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine to the cyclohexene. Compound 14, having the 1,3-substitution pattern and a single methylene chain, was the most potent. The 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine could be replaced by other aryl-cyclic amines with a slight loss in activity. The phenyl group on the cyclohexene ring could be para substituted; electron-donating groups were better tolerated than electron-withdrawing groups. Finally, the enantiomers of 14 were resolved via the 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate salts. Although both isomers were partial DA agonists, the (+)-enantiomer had higher intrinsic activity than the (-)-enantiomer. Syntheses were developed that allowed rapid preparation of analogues. An X-ray crystal structure determination of an intermediate identified the (+)-isomer of 14 as having R configuration. This compound, designated CI-1007 (PD 143188), was found to have antipsychotic-like activity in behavioral tests; in particular, it was orally active in the conditioned avoidance test in squirrel monkeys with an ED50 of 0.6 mg/kg.

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e.

Changes in the aromatic ring linked to N-1 piperazine ring led to the identification of 2-methoxyphenyl and 2,3-dichlorophenyl derivatives (compounds 6 and 13) displaying moderate D(3) affinity (K(i) = 145 and 31 nM, respectively). Intermediate alkyl chain elongation in compounds 1, 6, and 13 improved binding affinity for the D(3) receptor and decreased the D(4) affinity (compounds 18-26). Among these latter compounds, the N-[4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl]-3-methoxybenzamide (19) was further modified with the replacement or of the 2,3-dichlorophenyl moiety (compounds 27-30) or of the 3-methoxyphenyl ring (compounds 31-41). In this way, we identified several high-affinity D(3) ligands (0.13 nM < K(i)'s < 4.97 nM) endowed with high selectivity over D(2), D(4), 5-HT(1A), and alpha(1) receptors.

By investigation of the optimal position for the basic nitrogen in a series of 2-phenyl-3-piperidylindoles, it was found that with the basic nitrogen at the 3-position of the piperidine it was not necessary to further substitute the piperidine in order to obtain good binding at h5-HT(2A) receptors. This meant the compounds no longer had high affinity at the IKr potassium channel, an issue with previous series of 2-aryl-3-(4-piperidyl)indoles. Improvements could be made to oral bioavailability in this series by reduction of the pK(a) of the basic nitrogen, by adding a fluorine atom to the piperidine ring, leading to 3-(4-fluoropiperidin-3-yl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole (17). Metabolic studies with this compound identified oxidation at the 6-position of the indole as a major route in vitro and in vivo in rats. Blocking this position with a fluorine atom led to 6-fluoro-3-(4-fluoropiperidin-3-yl)-2-phenyl-1H-indole (22), an antagonist with 0.06 nM affinity for h5-HT(2A) receptors, with bioavailability of 80% and half-life of 12 h in rats.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671367,20181017,9795587|9821248|9838960|9842124|9882067|9948670|10091189|10493741|10495305|10495787|10520440|10522146|10542381|10546579|10588666|10589897|10615016|10640054|10640055|10708935|10711404|10713670|10762881|10804534|10805130|10851309|10853014|12111141|54186017|71458069,103220576|103220587|103220783|103220784|103221045|103221359|103221360|103221394|103221419|103221913|103221919|103654512|103654513|103654514|103654515|103654516|103654568|103654569|103654570|103654571|103654572|103654642|103654643|103654644|103654645|103654646|163329792|174494899|174510438|174520698,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11334570,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL

The diazepine analogues display selective binding to the dopamine D-4 and serotonin S-2A receptors similar to that of clozapine, but none has a dopamine D-4 selectivity (Ki for the dopamine D-2A receptor/Ki for the dopamine D-4 receptor) greater than that of clozapine. All of the oxepin analogues also show substantial binding to the dopamine D-4 and serotonin S-2A receptors with 10-(4-methylpiperazino)dibenz[b,f]oxepin having a dopamine D-4 selectivity greater than that of clozapine. Some of the 5H-dibenzo-[a,d]cycloheptene analogues also show strong binding to both the dopamine D-4 and serotonin S-2A receptors, 5-methyl-10-(4-methylpiperazino)-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cycloheptene having a dopamine D-4 selectivity of 7.8 as compared to 10 for clozapine but a serotonin S-2A selectivity (Ki for the dopamine D-2 receptor/Ki for the serotonin S-2A receptor) of 2.0 as compared to 28 for clozapine. The serotonin S-2A selectivity of 2-chloro-10-(4-methylpiperazino)-5H-dibenzo[a,d]-cycloheptene++ + is 200. As an extension of these studies, chiral 5-substitute 10-(1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-1-methyl-4-pyridinyl)-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohept ene analogues show a substantial enantiospecificity toward dopamine and serotonin receptor subtypes, (R)-(-)-5-methyl compound having a 2-fold higher dopamine D-4 selectivity than its (S)-(+) enantiomer as the result of enhanced binding to the dopamine D-4 receptor rather than diminished binding to the dopamine D-2 receptor.

Optimization studies were carried out on 8 with the aim of achieving 1000-fold selectivity for hD(4) over all other receptors while retaining the good pharmacokinetic properties of the lead. After initial preparation of 8 as a minor component in a low-yielding reaction, a novel and regioselective 'four-step/one-pot' procedure was developed which proved to be applicable to rapid investigation of the SAR of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one ring. Various changes to substituents attached to the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one core of 8 did not significantly improve selectivity for hD(4) over hD(2) and hD(3). Greater selectivity (>1000-fold) was ultimately achieved by meta substitution of the benzyl group of 8 with various substituents. Compounds 28, 31, and 32 all possess the required selectivity for hD(4) over the other dopamine subtypes, but only 32 has >1000-fold selectivity over all the key counterscreens we tested against.

Additionally, it was discovered that a group such as 3-(3-methoxybenzyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl in the 2-position of the indole ring (43) can replace the arylsulfonyl substituent in the 1-position with no loss of affinity. This suggested that the binding conformation of the aminoethyl side chain at this receptor was toward the 4-position of the indole ring and was supported by the fact that the 4-(aminoethyl)indoles (45) also displayed high affinity, as did the conformationally rigid 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[c,d]indole (49).

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation.

However, definitive behavioral investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly selective D3 agonists and antagonists. In an attempt to design a novel class of D3 ligands with which to study this receptor system, a series of chemically divergent compounds that possessed various structural features that exist within several classes of reputed D3 agents was screened and compared to the recently reported NGB 2904 (58b). On the basis of these results, a novel series of compounds was designed that included functional moieties that were required for high-affinity and selective binding to D3 receptors. All the compounds in this series included an aryl-substituted piperazine ring, a varying alkyl chain linker (C3-C5), and a terminal aryl amide. The compounds were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for binding in CHO cells transfected with human D2, D3, or D4 receptor cDNAs. D3 binding affinities ranged from K(i) = 1.4 to 1460 nM. The most potent analogue in this series, 51, demonstrated a D3/D2 selectivity of 64 and a D3/D4 selectivity of 1300. Structure-activity relationships for this class of ligands at D3 receptors will provide new leads toward the development of highly selective and potent molecular probes that will prove useful in the elucidation of the role D3 receptors play in the psychomotor stimulant and reinforcing properties of cocaine.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671385,20181017,1687|10073022|10436285|10885524|10927750|10972865|10983150|11005852|11026289|11133385|11431895|11762743|11812065|11812838|12066264|12066265|12071089|12997412|12997413|21460314|24810004|44337675|44337709|44337725|44338149|44338248,103172853|103172953|103173061|103252206|103264934|103264935|103265436|103265479|103265481|103265519|103265733|103265758|103270704|103301311|103328497|103328573|103328577|103328604|103328884|103328913|103329001|103329383|103329511|103329593|103329698|194179160,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11543687,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels. These agents should be of therapeutic value in treating disorders resulting from hypo- and hyperdopaminergic activity, without the side effects associated with complete D2 agonism or antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671729,20181015,44356304,103371739,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9435894,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL

Targetting high affinity and D(3) versus D(2) receptor-preferring ligands, the partial agonist BP 897 was taken as a lead structure. Variations in the spacer and the aryl moiety led to N-alkylated 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)piperazines with markedly improved affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the structural development. Pharmacophore models for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor ligands were developed from their potentially bioactive conformation and were compared in order to get insight into molecular properties of importance for D(2)/D(3) receptor selectivity. For the 72 compounds presented here, an extended and more linear conformation in the aliphatic or aryl spacers turned out to be crucial for dopamine D(3) receptor selectivity. Structural diversity in the aryl moiety (benzamides, heteroarylamides, arylimides) had a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D(3) receptor affinity, which was optimized with more rigid aryl acrylamide derivatives. Compound 38 (ST 280, (E)-4-iodo-N-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide) displayed a most promising pharmacological profile (K(i) (hD(3)) = 0.5 nM; K(i) (hD(2L)) = 76.4 nM; selectivity ratio of 153), and above that, compound 38 offered the prospect of a novel radioligand as a pharmacological tool for various D(3) receptor-related in vitro and in vivo investigation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671730,20181017,3038495|9827991|10368423|10874342|10905430|10919602|10939008|10940279|10949917|10951185|10960767|10961112|10971923|10983103|10994916|11027407|11091160|11102188|11102301|11113582|11730189|11733372|11761374|11761412|11812299|11812905|11826347|11826673|21219157|44329321|44350586|44350625|44350653|44350660|44350674|44350675|44350679|44350685|44350714|44350728|44350752|44350754|44350759|44350773|44350774|44350782|44350788|44350795|44350796|44350798|44350799|44350806|44350824|44350826|44350835|44350839|44350841|44350842|44350843|44350845|44350849|44350852|44350861|44350867|44350871|44350874|44350875|44350888|44350889|44350908|44350909|44350919|44350920|44351005,103192597|103194907|103197235|103311769|103358646|103358762|103358789|103358854|103358867|103358870|103358895|103358896|103358898|103358944|103358948|103358949|103358956|103358966|103358967|103358971|103358988|103359060|103359061|103359092|103359193|103359199|103359208|103359239|103359240|103359265|103359266|103359272|103359281|103359298|103359310|103359311|103359313|103359314|103359332|103359336|103359337|103359338|103359342|103359345|103359378|103359402|103359405|103359420|103359431|103359434|103359435|103359437|103359440|103359452|103359465|103359467|103359487|103359489|103359497|103359505|103359507|103359516|103359527|103359530|103359567|103359568|103359569|103359570|103359571|103359614|103359615|103359649|103359650|103359793|103359830,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930150,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL

Other structure-dependent efficacy studies in the dopamine D(4) field have suggested a critical interaction of the heteroarylmethyl moiety with specific protein microdomains in controlling intrinsic activity. Our studies indicate that for some binding orientations, the phenylpiperazine moiety also plays a key role in determining efficacy. These data also implicate a kinetic or efficiency term, contained within measured functional affinities for agonists, which support a sequential binding and conformational stabilization model for receptor activation.

(S)-Phenylpiperidines having an aromatic substituent with a high group dipole moment in the 3-position, i.e., meta with respect to the piperidine ring, and being N-substituted with a propyl group were found to be highly active in vivo on the synthesis and turnover of dopamine.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels.

This study suggests that D2 affinity may be the primary underlying mechanism for acute catalepsy induction by haloperidol.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671416,20181001,3559|13091268|135398737,103165765|103167216|103488767,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14552778,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Molecular modeling, further structure-activity relationship studies, and identification of novel atypical antipsychotic agents._||_Abstract: Recently we reported the pharmacological characterization of the 9,10-dihydropyrrolo[1,3]benzothiazepine derivative (S)-(+)-8 as a novel atypical antipsychotic agent. This compound had an optimum pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratio of 1.21 (pK(i) 5-HT(2A) = 8.83; pK(i) D(2) = 7.79). The lower D(2) receptor affinity of (S)-(+)-8 compared to its enantiomer was explained by the difficulty in reaching the conformation required to optimally fulfill the D(2) pharmacophore. With the aim of finding novel atypical antipsychotics we further investigated the core structure of (S)-(+)-8, synthesizing analogues with specific substituents; the structure-activity relationship (SAR) study was also expanded with the design and synthesis of other analogues characterized by a pyrrolo[2,1-b][1,3]benzothiazepine skeleton, substituted on the benzo-fused ring or on the pyrrole system. On the 9,10-dihydro analogues the substituents introduced on the pyrrole ring were detrimental to affinity for dopamine and for 5-HT(2A) receptors, but the introduction of a double bond at C-9/10 on the structure of (S)-(+)-8 led to a potent D(2)/5-HT(2A) receptor ligand with a typical binding profile (9f, pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratio of 1.01, log Y = 8.43). Then, to reduce D(2) receptor affinity and restore atypicality on unsaturated analogues, we exploited the effect of specific substitutions on the tricyclic system of 9f. Through a molecular modeling approach we generated a novel series of potential atypical antipsychotic agents, with optimized 5HT(2A)/D(2) receptor affinity ratios and that were easier to synthesize and purify than the reference compound (S)-(+)-8. A number of SAR trends were identified, and among the analogues synthesized and tested in binding assays, 9d and 9m were identified as the most interesting, giving atypical log Y scores respectively 4.98 and 3.18 (pK(i) 5-HT(2A)/D(2) ratios of 1.20 and 1.30, respectively). They had a multireceptor affinity profile and could be promising atypical agents. Compound 9d, whose synthesis is easier and whose binding profile is atypical (log Y score similar to that of olanzapine, 3.89), was selected for further biological investigation. Pharmacological and biochemical studies confirmed an atypical antipsychotic profile in vivo. The compound was active on conditioned avoidance response at 1.1 mg/kg, a dose 100-times lower than that required to cause catalepsy (ED(50) >90 mg/kg), it induced a negligible increase of prolactin serum levels after single and multiple doses, and antagonized the cognitive impairment induced by phencyclidine. In conclusion, the pharmacological profile of 9d proved better than clozapine and olanzapine, making this compound a potential clinical candidate.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672100,20180908,3559|9796255|135398737,103165765|103167216|103436077,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14695828,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

63226,Confirmatory,Ability to displace [3H]spiperone from human dopamine receptor D2 stably expressed in CHO cells.,"Title: 4-Heterocyclylpiperidines as selective high-affinity ligands at the human dopamine D4 receptor._||_Abstract: 5-(4-Chlorophenyl)-3-(1-(4-chlorobenzyl)piperidin-4-yl)pyrazole (3) was identified from screening of the Merck sample collection as a human dopamine D4 (hD4) receptor ligand with moderate affinity (61 nM) and 4-fold selectivity over human D2 (hD2) receptors. Four separate parts of the molecule have been examined systematically to explore structure-activity relationships with respect to hD4 affinity and selectivity over other dopamine receptors. It was found that the 4-chlorophenyl group attached to the pyrazole is optimal, as is the 4-substituted piperidine. The lipophilic group on the basic nitrogen is more amenable to change, with the optimal group found to be a phenethyl. The aromatic heterocyle can be altered to a number of different groups, with isoxazoles and pyrimidines showing improved affinities. This heterocycle can also be advantageously alkylated, improving the selectivity of the compounds over D2 receptors. It is hypothesized that the conformation around the bond joining the aromatic heterocycle to the piperidine is important for D4 affinity, based on crystal structures of isoxazoles (29 and 30) and on a conformationally constrained compound (28). Putting all the favorable changes together led to the discovery that 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)iso xazole (36) is a nanomolar antagonist at human dopamine D4 receptors with > 500-fold selectivity over hD2 and > 200-fold selectivity over hD3.

63227,Confirmatory,Affinity towards Dopamine receptor D2,"Title: CoMFA-based prediction of agonist affinities at recombinant D1 vs D2 dopamine receptors._||_Abstract: We have previously shown that using agonist affinity at recombinant receptors selectively expressed in clonal cells as the dependent variable in three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship studies (3D-QSAR) presents a unique opportunity for accuracy and precision in measurement. Thus, a comparison of affinity's structural determinants for a set of compounds at two different recombinant dopamine receptors represents an attainable goal for 3D-QSAR. A molecular database of bound conformations of 16 structurally diverse agonists was established by alignment with a high-affinity template compound for the D1 receptor, 3-allyl-6-bromo-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-1H-benzazepin. A second molecular database of the bound conformations of the same compounds was established against a second template for the D2 receptor, bromocriptine. These aligned structures suggested three-point pharmacophore maps (one cationic nitrogen and two electronegative centers) for the two dopamine receptors, which differed primarily in the height of the nitrogen above the plane of the catechol ring and in the nature of the hydrogen-bonding region. The ln(1/KL) values for the low-affinity agonist binding conformation at recombinant D1 and D2 dopamine receptors stably expressed in C6 glioma cells were used as the target property for the CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) of the 16 aligned structures. The resulting CoMFA models yielded cross-validated R2 (q2) values (standard error of prediction) of 0. 879 (1.471, with five principal components) and 0.834 (1.652, with five principal components) for D1 and D2 affinity, respectively. The simple R2 values (standard error of the estimate) were 0.994 (0.323) and 0.999 (0.116), respectively, for D1 and D2 receptor. F values were 341 and 2465 for D1 and D2 models, respectively, with 5 and 10 df. The predictive utility of the CoMFA model was evaluated at both receptors using the dopamine agonists, apomorphine and 7-OH-DPAT. Predictions of KL were accurate at both receptors. Flexible 3D searches of several chemical databases (NCI, MDDR, CMC, ACD, and Maybridge) were done using basic pharmacophore models at each receptor to determine the similarity of hit lists between the two models. The D1 and D2 models yielded different lists of lead compounds. Several of the lead compounds closely resembled high-affinity training set compounds. Finally, homology modeling of agonist binding to the D2 receptor revealed some consistencies and inconsistencies with the CoMFA-derived D2 model and provided a possible rationale for features of the D2 CoMFA contour map. Together these results suggest that CoMFA-homology based models may provide useful insights concerning differential agonist-receptor interactions at related receptors. The results also suggest that comparisons of CoMFA models for two structurally related receptors may be a fruitful approach for differential QSAR.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672210,20181016,681|3341|5610|11492|28864|47811|54562|122132|167715|6603820|6603954|6852376|10452020|12668019|44331310|44358192,103167911|103172070|103175300|103181504|103194192|103197419|103209873|103316191|103387788|103408740|103512529|103543557|103734524|103734547|103734609|103760873,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9784114,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Following examination of molecular models, the flexible butyl linker present in 13 was replaced by a more conformationally constrained cyclohexylethyl linker, leading to compounds with improved oral bioavailability and selectivity over other receptors. Subsequent optimization of this new series to improve the cytochrome P450 inhibitory profile and CNS penetration gave trans-N-[4-[2-(6-cyano-1, 2,3, 4-tetrahydroisoquinolin-2-yl)ethyl]cyclohexyl]-4-quinolinecarbo xamide (24, SB-277011).

63251,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]spiperone from human Dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Design, synthesis, and evaluation of metabolism-based analogues of haloperidol incapable of forming MPP+-like species._||_Abstract: The long-term, irreversible, Parkinsonism-like side effects of haloperidol have been speculated to involve several mechanisms. More recently, it has been speculated that the metabolic transformation to MPP+-like species may contribute to the Parkinsonism-like side effects. Because BCPP+ and its reduced analogue have been shown to possess the potential to destroy dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatum, we have designed new analogues of haloperidol lacking the structural features necessary to form neurotoxic quaternary species but retaining their dopamine-binding capacity. The most potent agent at the D2 receptor, the homopiperidine analogue 11, was found to be equipotent to haloperidol. It was also of interest to identify analogues with DA binding profiles similar to that of clozapine at the dopamine receptor subtypes. Evaluation of the proposed agents shows that the ratio of D2 to D4 (2) binding of clozapine was mimicked by 7 [K(i)(D2) = 33, K(i)(D3) = 200, K(i)(D4) = 11 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 3] and 9 [K(i)(D2) = 44, K(i)(D3) = 170, K(i)(D4) = 24 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 2]. A preliminary in-vivo testing of compound 7 shows that its behavioral profile is similar to that of clozapine. This profile suggests that there is a need for further evaluation of these two synthetic agents and their enantiomers for efficacy and lack of catalepsy in animal models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672843,20210802,3559|9906978|9975463|11199716|11200115|11257780|11303835|11325428|11338272|11382826|11428871|11474752|135398737,103165765|103167216|103391817|103391818|103391819|103392132|103392133|103392134|103392135|103392137|103392158|103392256|103392257,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14736232,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, a major disadvantage of many current medications are the observed extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), postulated to arise from D(2) receptor antagonism. Consequently, a selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist could offer an attractive antipsychotic therapy, devoid of the unwanted EPS. Using SAR information gained in two previously reported series of potent and selective D(3) receptor antagonists, as exemplified by the 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine 10 and the 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindoline 11, a range of 7-sulfonyloxy- and 7-sulfonylbenzazepines has been prepared. Compounds of this type combined a high level of D(3) affinity and selectivity vs D(2) with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in the rat. Subsequent optimization of this series to improve selectivity over a range of receptors and reduce cytochrome P450 inhibitory potential gave trans-3-(2-(4-((3-(3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxidiazolyl))phenyl)carboxamido)cyclohexyl)ethyl)-7-methylsulfonyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (58, SB-414796). This compound is a potent and selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist with high oral bioavailability and is CNS penetrant in the rat. Subsequent evaluation in the rat has shown that 58 preferentially reduces firing of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (A10) compared to the substantia nigra (A9), an observation consistent with a prediction for atypical antipsychotic efficacy. In a separate study, 58 has been shown to block expression of the conditioned place preference (CPP) response to cocaine in male rats, suggesting that it may also have a role in the treatment of cue-induced relapse in drug-free cocaine addicts.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL674348,20181017,45262323|45262339|45262343|45262345|45262347|45262348|45262349|45262363|45262369|45262381|45262384|45262385|45262402|45262403|45262404|45262410|45262412|45262415|45262416|45262417|45264008|45265219|45265240|45265244|45265257|45265266|45265305|45265589|45265590|45265597|45265605|45265612|45265633,163312675|163316033|163319496|163329760|163336742|174484820|174484821|174489875|174500115|174500117|174505298|174515586|174515587|174515589|174520684|174520685|174520686|194137837|194137838|194151548|194151549|194151552|194158572|194158575|194158576|194165503|194165506|194165508|194172363|194172365|194172370|194186050|194186053,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14584946,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL

The human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors (previously known as 5-HT1Dbeta and 5-HT1Dalpha, respectively), although encoded by two distinct genes, are structurally very similar. Pharmacologically, these two receptors have been differentiated using nonselective chemical tools such as ketanserin and ritanserin, but the absence of truly selective agents has meant that the precise function of the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors has not been defined. In this paper we describe how, using computational chemistry models as a guide, the nonselective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D receptor antagonist 4 was structurally modified to produce the selective 5-HT1B receptor inverse agonist 5, 1'-methyl-5-[[2'-methyl-4'-(5-methyl-1,2, 4-oxadiazol-3-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]carbonyl]-2,3,6, 7-tetrahydrospiro[furo[2,3-f]indole-3,4'-piperidine] (SB-224289).

Fluorescein and/or NBD (7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) derivatives of PPHT (D-2 agonist), spiperone (D-2 antagonist), SKF 38393 (D-1 agonist), and SKF 83566 (D-1 antagonist) were synthesized via their amino-functionalized analogues and all ligands were pharmacologically evaluated by measuring their ability to displace [3H]SCH 23390 and [3H]spiperone from D-1 and D-2 receptor sites in caudate putamen of monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). The fluorescein derivatives of PPHT and SKF 83566 and the NBD derivatives of spiperone and SKF 83566 retained the high affinity and selectivity of the parent ligands. The NBD derivatives of PPHT showed higher D-2 receptor affinity and selectivity than their parent ligands. The enantiomers of the fluorescent derivatives of PPHT were also synthesized and were found to exhibit stereoselectivity in binding to the D-2 receptor, with the S enantiomers having a considerably higher affinity than their R analogues. In contrast to these results, the fluorescein derivative of SKF 38393 showed only a low affinity for the D-1 receptor. These fluorescein- and NBD-coupled D-1 and D-2 receptor ligands have considerable significance as potential probes in the study of distribution of the receptors at the cellular/subcellular level and of their mobility in membranes in normal/diseased states by use of fluorescence microscopic and fluorescence photobleaching recovery techniques, respectively. The development of these novel fluorescent probes should also provide new leads for the design and synthesis of additional fluorescent ligands with better fluorescent properties and/or higher affinity/selectivity for the DA receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670746,20181013,15115513,103331719,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,1956042,0,NULL,P14416,9527,NULL,,NULL

The 10-bromo 11-hydroxy derivative 9e was prepared by treatment of precursor 9c with bromine in chloroform. The affinities of these compounds for the D1 and D2 dopamine receptor classes and for their effects on adenylate cyclase activity were assessed in rat striatal membranes. In addition to producing only minimal increases in adenylate cyclase activity (< or = 15%), these phenolic derivatives generally had significantly lower affinities for D1 and D2 receptors (D1 IC50 > or = 102 nM, D2 IC50 > or = 210 nM) than did their catechol analogues. Further, compounds bearing a cis B/C-ring fusion displayed lower affinities than those bearing a trans configuration, paralleling the activity differences between the catechol analogues. The data for these rigid dopamine receptor ligands from the benzo[a]phenanthridine class lend additional support for the hypothesis that D1 agonist activity is optimized by a trans ring configuration that maintains the beta-phenyldopamine substructure in the 'trans-beta-rotamer.'",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672300,20181014,44339794,103333316,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7830274,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

The affinity and selectivity of these compounds were determined using in vitro receptor binding assays, and their log P values were estimated using HPLC analysis. The effect of various N-substituents on the sigma-1 and sigma-2 dissociation constants was examined. These substituents included fluoroalkyl, hydroxyalkyl, iodopropenyl, and selected ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted benzyl groups. Also determined were the effects of various moieties on the phenoxy ring; specifically 4-iodo, 4-bromo, 4-nitro, 4-cyano, 3-bromo, and pentafluoro substituents were examined. The ranges in the dissociation constants of these compounds for sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors were 0.38-24.3 and 3.9-361 nM, respectively. The ratio of Ki (sigma-2/sigma-1) ranged from 1.19 to 121.

These peptidomimetics were designed to examine the following: (1) the effect that changing the size of the thiazolidine and lactam ring systems would have on the ability of these systems to mimic the type-II beta-turn and (2) the effect that these structural perturbations would have on the ability of the peptidomimetics to modulate dopamine receptors. Through the use of the [3H]spiroperidol/N-propylnorapomorphine (NPA) dopamine D2 receptor competitive binding assay, 3 and 4, at a concentration of 100 nM, decreased the dissociation constant of the high-affinity state of the dopamine receptor for the agonist. These effects were observed when either Gpp(NH)p was absent or present and they were comparable to those produced by PLG at a concentration of 1 microM. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 also increased the percentage of D2 receptors that existed in the high-affinity state. Even with Gpp(NH)p present, 3 and 4 were able to return the RH/RL ratios to values observed in the respective controls where Gpp(NH)p was absent. Furthermore, both peptidomimetics were able to attenuate the Gpp(NH)p-induced shift to the low-affinity state to a greater extent than PLG. Peptidomimetics 3 and 4 were evaluated in vivo as modulators of apomorphine-induced rotational behavior in the 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat model of hemiparkinsonism, and each affected the rotational behavior in a bell-shaped dose-response relationship producing increases of 95 +/- 31% (0.01 mg/kg, ip) and 88 +/- 14% (0.001 mg/kg, ip), respectively.

The presence of an additional methyl group at the C-2 position (R3 in 3) of the cis-(+/-)-8-methoxy-N-n-propyl analog resulted in enhancement of in vitro 5-HT1A receptor binding affinity, with the (2 beta,3a alpha,9a alpha)-(+/-)-isomer displaying potency 35 times greater than the (2 alpha,3a alpha,9a alpha)-(+/-)-isomer.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672570,20181014,6005|6240,103167211|103676439,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097538,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL

These compounds are conformationally restricted, angular tricyclic analogs of 2-aminotetralin. The synthesis was achieved in several steps from the corresponding 2-tetralones. The enantiomers of the cis analogs were obtained from either fractional recrystallizations of the diastereomeric salts of di-p-toluoyl-L-(or D)-tartaric acid or an asymmetric synthesis using chiral (R)-alpha-methylbenzylamine. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests. Analogs with 9-methoxy substitution (R1 in 3) showed mixed 5-HT1A agonist and dopamine antagonist activities whereas the corresponding 9-hydroxy analogs displayed selective 5-HT1A agonist activity. The cis analogs were found to be more potent than the corresponding trans analogs and in the cis series, the (3aR)-(-)-enantiomers displayed higher potency. Nitrogen substitution (R2 in 3) with either an n-propyl or an allyl group produced similar activities whereas replacement with a bulky alpha-methylbenzyl group resulted in loss of activity. Analogs without aromatic substitution (R1 = H in 3) still showed good 5-HT1A agonist activity, although less potent than the 9-methoxy series. In this case, the trans analogs possessed equal or higher in vitro 5-HT1A affinity than the corresponding cis analogs. Analogs with either 6-methoxy or 6-hydroxy substitution (R1 in 3) were found to display dopamine antagonist properties. However, only N-allyl analogs showed this activity. In the 6-methoxy-N-allyl series, the cis analog was found to be more potent than the trans analog. Again, between the pair of cis enantiomers, the (3aR)-(-)-enantiomer showed higher potency. Incorporation of an additional methyl group into 9-methoxy cis analogs at C-2 resulted in retention of potent 5-HT1A agonist activity.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672571,20181014,6005,103167211,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8097537,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,197,,NULL

The synthesis and biological testing of compounds 2-7 has been previously reported. The test compounds were compared both quantitatively and graphically to compound 1. Calculations on both the free-base and protonated forms of each compound were carried out. To insure that conformation space was adequately sampled, the test compounds were energy minimized from different starting geometries; ring inversion of the heterocycle was employed, as were dihedral driver calculations on the phenyl or benzyl rings. For N-methyl-6-chloro-7-hydroxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline (2), it was determined that the torsion angle tau(C8a-C1-C12-C17) had energy minima at approximately 60 degrees and 240 degrees.

They were evaluated in binding assays with [(3)H]GR 113808 as the 5-HT(4) receptor radioligand.

We have prepared the enantiomers and diastereomers of ifenprodil along with a series of partial structures in order to explore the basic structure activity relations within this class of compounds. From this study, it is clear that alpha 1 adrenergic and NMDA receptor activities may be separated by selection of the threo relative stereochemistry. Examination of the optical isomers of threo-ifenprodil (2) reveals that no further improvement in receptor selectivity is gained from either antipode. Individual removal of most of the structural fragments from the ifenprodil molecule generally results in less active compounds although fluorinated derivative 9 with threo relative stereochemistry is somewhat more potent and substantially more selective for the NMDA receptor. Finally a minimum structure for activity in this series (14) has been identified.

64134,Literature-derived,Intrinsic activity was Determined,"Title: Comparison of 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 pharmacophores. X-ray structures and affinities of conformationally constrained ligands._||_Abstract: Conformational and molecular mechanics studies of a new series of tricyclic ligands with affinity for either the dopamine D2 receptor or the 5-HT1A receptor, or both, has enabled us to elaborate considerably on previous pharmacophore models for these receptors. The new tricyclic ligands are either angular, 2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indole derivatives, or linear, 2,3,3a,4,5,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives; they have either cis or trans ring junctions, and many of the ligands are resolved. In order to have X-ray crystal coordinates for every structural type, two additional crystal structures were determined: 14a, the trans-(+-)-6-hydroxy-3-(n-propyl) angular derivative as the hydrochloride, and (+-)-1,2,2a,3,4,8b-hexahydro-8-methoxy-2-(2-propenyl)-naphth[2,1- b]azetidine hydrochloride (16d). Several recently reported imidazoquinolinones with dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were also used in developing the models as were other known ligands which are conformationally constrained. A new method for determining intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor made consistent and reliable estimates of dopamine agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities available. The models explain these activities in terms of the 3-dimensional structural features of the ligands and their probable orientations at the D2 receptor site. They also explain why allyl and propyl analogs of some structures have very different affinities while affinities are quite similar for allyl and propyl analogs of other structures; at both receptors a particular orientation of the amine substituent in the binding site correlates with preference for allyl over propyl derivatives. Suggestions are made for enhancing selectivity at the 5-HT1A receptor or at the dopamine D2 receptor. An angular, cis, (3aR,9bS), 2-propyl, 9-hydroxy, 3-(n-propyl) analog should be selective for the 5-HT1A receptor. A linear, trans, (3aR,9aS), 7-hydroxy, 1-(2-propenyl) analog should be selective for the dopamine D2 receptor, and would be predicted to be an antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670778,20181013,10014136|14944884,103193992|103194293,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496900,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

In addition to its full D1 agonist properties, 2 also is a good ligand for D2-like dopamine receptors. The profound anti-Parkinsonian actions of this compound make determination of its enantioselectivity at both D1 and D2 receptors of particular importance. To accomplish this, the enantiomers were resolved by preparation of diastereomeric (R)-O-methylmandelic acid amides of racemic trans-10,11-dimethoxy-5,6,6a,7,8,12b- hexahydrobenzo[a]phenanthridine 4 that were then separated by centrifugal chromatography. An X-ray analysis of the (-)-N-(R)-O-methylmandel diastereoamide revealed the absolute configuration to be 6aS,12bR. Removal of the chiral auxiliary and O,O-deprotection afforded enantiomeric amines that were then tested for biological activity. In striatal membranes, the (6aR,12bS)-(+)-enantiomer 2 had about twice the affinity of the racemate and 25-fold greater affinity than the (-)-enantiomer at the D1 receptor labeled by [3H]SCH23390 (K0.5s of 5.6, 11.6, and 149 nM, respectively). Similarly, the (+)-enantiomer 2 had about twice the affinity of the racemate for human D1 receptors expressed in transfected Ltk- cells. Functionally, the (+)-enantiomer of 2 was a full agonist, with an EC50 of 51 nM in activating striatal dopamine-sensitive adenylate cyclase versus 2.15 microM for the (-)-enantiomer. With respect to D2-like receptors, (+)-2 had a K0.5 of 87.7 nM in competing with [3H]spiperone at D2 binding sites in rat striatal membranes versus about 1 microM for the (-)-enantiomer. Together, these data demonstrate that both the D1 and D2 activities of dihydrexidine reside principally in the (6aR,12bS)-(+)-enantiomer. The results are discussed in the context of structure-activity relationships and conceptual models of the D1 receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670779,20181014,6603820,103197419,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7914538,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL
64136,Confirmatory,Low-affinity agonist dissociation constant against striatal Dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Comparative molecular field analysis-based prediction of drug affinities at recombinant D1A dopamine receptors._||_Abstract: Determination of quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for affinity at particular dopamine (DA) receptors has become an even greater priority with the cloning of five DA receptor subtypes. The use of agonist affinity at recombinant receptors selectively expressed in clonal cells as the dependent variable in QSAR presents a unique opportunity for accuracy and precision in measurement of biological values. Bound conformations of 11 agonists (for which both affinity data at the recombinant D1A DA receptor and stereochemical configurations were available) were determined by alignment with a template compound, SKF38393, which shows high affinity and selectivity for D1A receptors and is fairly rigid in structure. These aligned structures suggested a 3-point pharmacophore map (one cationic nitrogen and two electronegative centers) of the D1A DA receptor. This map shows both similarities and differences when compared with a previously reported D2 DA receptor pharmacophore map based on biological data from rat brain and with a recently published map of the native D1 DA receptor using several semirigid compounds. Log(1/K(d)) values at recombinant D1A DA receptors were used as the target property for a CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) of the 11 aligned structures. The resulting CoMFA model yielded a cross-validated r(2)(q(2)) value of 0.829 and a simple r(2) = 0.96. In contrast, when a CoMFA model was developed for 10 of these compounds using striatal D1 K(d) values, the q(2) value was reduced to 0.178. These results are consistent with the idea that drug affinity data obtained from clonal cells expressing recombinant receptors may be superior to that obtained using heterogeneous mixtures of native receptors prepared from brain membranes. The predictive utility of the CoMFA model was evaluated using several high-affinity dopamine agonists and m- and p-tyramine, two compounds with a single hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring. Predictions were fairly accurate for all compounds but the two tyramines.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670780,20181015,6005,103167211,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8632409,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The compound had very low affinity for other monoaminergic receptors examined. The r5-HT1B receptor antagonism was demonstrated by the potentiation of the K+-stimulated release of [3H]-5-HT from superfused rat brain slices in vitro, an effect that was antagonized by addition of 5-HT to the superfusion fluid. (R)-25 at 20 mg/kg sc enhanced the 5-HT turnover in four rat brain regions (hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and frontal cortex) with about 40% measured as the 5-HTP accumulation after decarboxylase inhibition with 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine. At 3 mg/kg sc (R)-25 produced a significant increase in the number of wet dog shakes in rats, a 5-HT2A/5-HT2C response that was abolished by depletion of 5-HT after pretreatment with the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p-chlorophenylalanine.

The enantiomers of the cis analogs were obtained from either fractional recrystallizations of the diastereomeric salts of di-p-toluoyl-L-(or D)-tartaric acid or an asymmetric synthesis using chiral (R)-alpha-methylbenzylamine. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests. Analogs with 9-methoxy substitution (R1 in 3) showed mixed 5-HT1A agonist and dopamine antagonist activities whereas the corresponding 9-hydroxy analogs displayed selective 5-HT1A agonist activity. The cis analogs were found to be more potent than the corresponding trans analogs and in the cis series, the (3aR)-(-)-enantiomers displayed higher potency. Nitrogen substitution (R2 in 3) with either an n-propyl or an allyl group produced similar activities whereas replacement with a bulky alpha-methylbenzyl group resulted in loss of activity. Analogs without aromatic substitution (R1 = H in 3) still showed good 5-HT1A agonist activity, although less potent than the 9-methoxy series. In this case, the trans analogs possessed equal or higher in vitro 5-HT1A affinity than the corresponding cis analogs. Analogs with either 6-methoxy or 6-hydroxy substitution (R1 in 3) were found to display dopamine antagonist properties. However, only N-allyl analogs showed this activity. In the 6-methoxy-N-allyl series, the cis analog was found to be more potent than the trans analog. Again, between the pair of cis enantiomers, the (3aR)-(-)-enantiomer showed higher potency.

Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives._||_Abstract: The conformationally restricted linear tricyclic analogs of 5- and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)-tetralins were investigated for their serotonergic and dopaminergic properties. These cis and trans analogs of 2,3,3a,4,9,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole (3), where a five-membered ring is fused between the nitrogen and C-3 carbon of 2-aminotetralin, were synthesized from 5-methoxy- and 8-methoxytetralones. The enantiomers of trans-5-methoxy-N-n-propyl and -N-allyl analogs were obtained via fractional recrystallization of their di-p-toluoyl-L (or D) tartaric acid salts. All analogs were evaluated in the in vitro 5-HT1A and D2 binding assays and selected analogs were investigated further in biochemical and behavioral tests. In the 5-substituted series (R1 in 3), the trans isomers were found to possess higher levels of pharmacological activity then the corresponding cis isomers. The trans-5-methoxy analogs showed selective 5-HT1A receptor activity in vitro but displayed mixed 5-HT1A and D2 agonist properties in vivo. The corresponding trans-5-hydroxy analogs were found to be potent D2 agonists with full intrinsic activity. An examination of nitrogen substitution (R2 in 3) revealed that analogs with either an allyl or an n-propyl group displayed equipotent activities. Substitution with a cyclopropylmethyl or benzyl group resulted in reduced activity. Among the resolved analogs tested, the activity was found to reside exclusively in the (3aS)-(-)-enantiomers. In the 8-substituted series (R1 in 3), only 8-methoxy-N-allyl analogs were synthesized and evaluated. In this case, both cis and trans isomers showed equally weak in vitro 5-HT1A receptor agonist activity devoid of dopaminergic effects.

In order to determine if the discriminative stimulus effect of DOM is 5-HT1C- or 5-HT2-mediated, it would be informative to conduct tests of stimulus antagonism with a 5-HT1C- or 5-HT2-selective antagonist. To date, no such agents exist. Although the neuroleptic agent spiperone binds at D2 dopamine receptors and 5-HT1A serotonin receptors, (a) it displays about a 1000-fold selectivity for 5-HT2 versus 5-HT1C sites and (b) it has been used as a '5-HT2-selective' antagonist. Because spiperone is a behaviorally disruptive agent, it is not suitable for use in drug-discrimination studies. Using the spiperone molecule as a starting point, a limited structure-affinity investigation was conducted in order to identify a suitable antagonist with high affinity and selectivity for 5-HT2 receptors, and yet an antagonist that might lack the disruptive actions of spiperone. Various modifications of the spiperone molecule were examined, but most resulted in decreased 5-HT2 affinity or in loss of selectivity. One compound, 8-[3-(4-fluorophenoxy)propyl]-1-phenyl-1,3,8-triazaspiro[4.5]de can-4-on e (26), was shown to bind at 5-HT2 sites with high affinity (Ki = 2 nM) and > 2,000-fold selectivity versus 5-HT1C sites. In tests of stimulus antagonism using rats trained to discriminate 1 mg/kg of DOM from saline vehicle, 26 behaved as a potent antagonist (ED50 = 0.003 mg/kg) and lacked the disruptive effects associated with spiperone.

The structure-activity relationships surrounding this compound were studied by synthesis of analogues and evaluation of their dopaminergic activity. The cyclohexene substitution pattern was varied along with the length of the chain connecting the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine to the cyclohexene. Compound 14, having the 1,3-substitution pattern and a single methylene chain, was the most potent. The 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine could be replaced by other aryl-cyclic amines with a slight loss in activity. The phenyl group on the cyclohexene ring could be para substituted; electron-donating groups were better tolerated than electron-withdrawing groups. Finally, the enantiomers of 14 were resolved via the 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate salts. Although both isomers were partial DA agonists, the (+)-enantiomer had higher intrinsic activity than the (-)-enantiomer. Syntheses were developed that allowed rapid preparation of analogues. An X-ray crystal structure determination of an intermediate identified the (+)-isomer of 14 as having R configuration.

The dopaminergic and serotonergic effects of 2 and 3 were evaluated by use of in vitro and in vivo test systems. The results indicate that 3 is a potent, selective, and efficacious 5-HT1A receptor agonist. In contrast, 2 is a partial 5-HT1A receptor agonist of low potency which has affinity also for central D1 and D2A receptors. The differences in pharmacological profiles were rationalized by modeling of ligand-receptor interactions using homology-based receptor models of the 5-HT1A and D2A receptor binding site. The selective and pronounced serotonergic effects of 3 appear to be due to the C10-methyl group, which is accommodated by a lipophilic pocket in the 5-HT1A receptor.

The addition of various nucleophiles to (R)-lambda1,11-carbonylaporphine [(R)-11] or to the 1,11-hydroxymethyleneaporphine epimers gave separable mixtures of epimers. The epimeric ratios obtained in most reactions seem to be a result of steric factors directing the nucleophilic attack. The structure of the epimers was determined by a combination of X-ray crystallography (5 derivatives), NMR spectroscopy, and chemical correlation. Interesting and diverse pharmacological profiles of the derivatives were revealed through binding studies at serotonin 5-HT(7) and 5-HT(1A) receptors as well as at dopamine D(2A) receptors.

The use of agonist affinity at recombinant receptors selectively expressed in clonal cells as the dependent variable in QSAR presents a unique opportunity for accuracy and precision in measurement of biological values. Bound conformations of 11 agonists (for which both affinity data at the recombinant D1A DA receptor and stereochemical configurations were available) were determined by alignment with a template compound, SKF38393, which shows high affinity and selectivity for D1A receptors and is fairly rigid in structure. These aligned structures suggested a 3-point pharmacophore map (one cationic nitrogen and two electronegative centers) of the D1A DA receptor. This map shows both similarities and differences when compared with a previously reported D2 DA receptor pharmacophore map based on biological data from rat brain and with a recently published map of the native D1 DA receptor using several semirigid compounds. Log(1/K(d)) values at recombinant D1A DA receptors were used as the target property for a CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) of the 11 aligned structures. The resulting CoMFA model yielded a cross-validated r(2)(q(2)) value of 0.829 and a simple r(2) = 0.96. In contrast, when a CoMFA model was developed for 10 of these compounds using striatal D1 K(d) values, the q(2) value was reduced to 0.178. These results are consistent with the idea that drug affinity data obtained from clonal cells expressing recombinant receptors may be superior to that obtained using heterogeneous mixtures of native receptors prepared from brain membranes. The predictive utility of the CoMFA model was evaluated using several high-affinity dopamine agonists and m- and p-tyramine, two compounds with a single hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring.

The molecular masses of three major metabolites suggested that they were mono- and dihydroxylated derivatives of 1. We synthesized compounds 2 and 3, the two possible mono-p-hydroxyphenyl derivatives of 1, along with the bis-p-hydroxyphenyl derivative 4. These compounds coeluted by HPLC with the three hydroxylated metabolites of 1. Compounds 2-4 all had high affinities for DA D2 and D3 receptors and moderate affinities for D4 receptors. Like 1, compound 2 decreased DA synthesis and neuronal firing in rat brain, indicative of DA autoreceptor activation. Compound 2 inhibited exploratory locomotor activity in rodents and was active in the Sidman avoidance test in squirrel monkeys, predictive of antipsychotic activity in humans. Compounds 3 and 4 showed weak activity in all these tests. After squirrel monkeys were dosed with 1 orally at the ED100 dose of the Sidman avoidance test, the plasma concentration of 2 was below the limit of quantitation. Therefore, these metabolites are unlikely to contribute greatly to the potent activity seen with 1 in the Sidman avoidance test.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671448,20200703,127698|178078|10713620|10759963,103375468|103390510|103390537|103390790,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8544176,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL672520,20181016,54562,103543557,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR.

To extend this series of tricyclic DA agonists we used a classic bioisoster approach and synthesized thiopyran analogues of 7, which have a sulfur atom in the 6-position. We prepared trans-4-n-propyl-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-[1]benzothiopyrano[4, 3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol (9, trans-9-OH-PTBTO), its enantiomers ((+)-9 and (-)-9), the racemic cis-analogue (10), and the racemic trans-sulfoxide (11) and studied the potency and selectivity for DA receptors of these compounds. As with other rigid DA agonists, the highest affinity for DA receptors resided in one of the enantiomers, in this case the (-)-enantiomer of 9. On the basis of a single-crystal X-ray analysis of a key intermediate, the absolute configuration of (-)-9 was found to be 4aS,10bR, which is homochiral with (+)-(4aR,10bR)-7. In contrast to (+)-7 however, (-)-9 displayed no selectivity for any of the DA receptors. In addition, it has affinity for 5HT1A receptors.

Further pharmacological evaluation revealed that (-)-9 is a very potent full agonist at DA D2 receptors and a partial agonist at DA D3 receptors. The cis-analogue (+/-)-10 displayed the same profile, but with lower potency.

In the piperazine series, replacing the N-methyl group by a N-phenyl moiety (15-17, 30-32) provided a dramatic decrease of affinity for all receptors (K(i) > 1000 nM). A N-cyclohexyl group (20, 35) restored some affinity. Compounds with a N-benzyl (18, 33) or N-phenethyl side chain (19, 34) had significant affinities at D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. Homologation of the piperazine nucleus (29, 44) led to a significant decrease of the affinity at all receptors investigated. In the 4-aminopiperidine series, N-methyl derivatives (21, 36) possessed less affinity in comparison with the N-methylpiperazine analogues (8, 9) while the N-benzyl congeners (22, 37) showed similar affinities. The rigidification of piperidine nucleus as obtained in azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane derivatives (23, 38) involved a slight reduction of the affinity at D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors while the affinity at D(2L) receptors was dramatically increased. The introduction of N-substituted aminoalkylamines to replace N-methylpiperazine generally led to a significant decrease in the affinity for D(4.2) receptors but some of these molecules (24, 25, 41) presented a significant 5-HT(2A) binding affinity. The presence of a more flexible side chain induced an increased conformational freedom. Consequently, the preferential position of the distal nitrogen or its basicity in piperazine derivatives was greatly modified. 19 with a high D(4.2) and 5-HT(2A) affinity (K(i) = 40 and 103 nM, respectively) did not induce cataleptic phenomenon in the paw test in rats but significantly reduced the immobility time in Porsolt's test in mice suggesting antidepressant properties.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673081,20181017,3559|3802|9927411|10363821|10893228|11058829|11079832|11732013|135398737|135404757|135442113|135471592|135501649|136094866|136094867,103165765|103167216|103259600|103259841|103392692|103392965|103393110|103393134|103393445|103393457|103393471|103393473|103393492|103393810|103393811,1813,In vitro,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12408724,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,521,,NULL

As with other rigid DA agonists, the highest affinity for DA receptors resided in one of the enantiomers, in this case the (-)-enantiomer of 9. On the basis of a single-crystal X-ray analysis of a key intermediate, the absolute configuration of (-)-9 was found to be 4aS,10bR, which is homochiral with (+)-(4aR,10bR)-7. In contrast to (+)-7 however, (-)-9 displayed no selectivity for any of the DA receptors. In addition, it has affinity for 5HT1A receptors.

Further pharmacological evaluation revealed that (-)-9 is a very potent full agonist at DA D2 receptors and a partial agonist at DA D3 receptors. The cis-analogue (+/-)-10 displayed the same profile, but with lower potency. These findings were confirmed in vivo: in reserpinized rats (-)-9 displayed short-acting activation of locomotor activity (DA D2 agonism) and also lower lip retraction and flat body posture, (5HT1A agonism). Compound (+/-)-10 had no effect on locomotor activity. In unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, (-)-9 gave short-acting locomotor activation.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR.

Compound 38 (ST 280, (E)-4-iodo-N-(4-(4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)cinnamoylamide) displayed a most promising pharmacological profile (K(i) (hD(3)) = 0.5 nM; K(i) (hD(2L)) = 76.4 nM; selectivity ratio of 153), and above that, compound 38 offered the prospect of a novel radioligand as a pharmacological tool for various D(3) receptor-related in vitro and in vivo investigation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL675131,20200703,44350852|44350888|44351005,103359465|103359567|103359830,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930150,0,NULL,P14416,9527,NULL,,NULL

A QSAR model highlighted the importance of lipophilicity and ionization in controlling beta(2) duration. It was found that design rules logD(7.4) > 2, secondary amine pK(a) > 8.0, yielded ultra-long duration compounds. This model was used successfully to guide the design of long- and ultra-long-acting compounds. The QSAR model is discussed in terms of the exosite model, and the plasmalemma diffusion microkinetic hypothesis, for the control of beta(2) duration. Data presented strongly suggests that beta(2) duration is primarily controlled by the membrane affinity of these compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL684365,20181017,9956101|10319630|10320619|11677323|19082152|44339032|44339091,103330805|103330974|103331009|103331335|103331475|103331548|103331684,1813,In vivo,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12852752,0,NULL,P14416,10141,NULL,,NULL

227608,Literature-derived,Intrinsic activity against dopamine D 2 receptor,"Title: Comparison of 5-HT1A and dopamine D2 pharmacophores. X-ray structures and affinities of conformationally constrained ligands._||_Abstract: Conformational and molecular mechanics studies of a new series of tricyclic ligands with affinity for either the dopamine D2 receptor or the 5-HT1A receptor, or both, has enabled us to elaborate considerably on previous pharmacophore models for these receptors. The new tricyclic ligands are either angular, 2,3,3a,4,5,9b-hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indole derivatives, or linear, 2,3,3a,4,5,9a-hexahydro-1H-benz[f]indole derivatives; they have either cis or trans ring junctions, and many of the ligands are resolved. In order to have X-ray crystal coordinates for every structural type, two additional crystal structures were determined: 14a, the trans-(+-)-6-hydroxy-3-(n-propyl) angular derivative as the hydrochloride, and (+-)-1,2,2a,3,4,8b-hexahydro-8-methoxy-2-(2-propenyl)-naphth[2,1- b]azetidine hydrochloride (16d). Several recently reported imidazoquinolinones with dopaminergic and serotonergic activities were also used in developing the models as were other known ligands which are conformationally constrained. A new method for determining intrinsic activity at the D2 receptor made consistent and reliable estimates of dopamine agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist activities available. The models explain these activities in terms of the 3-dimensional structural features of the ligands and their probable orientations at the D2 receptor site. They also explain why allyl and propyl analogs of some structures have very different affinities while affinities are quite similar for allyl and propyl analogs of other structures; at both receptors a particular orientation of the amine substituent in the binding site correlates with preference for allyl over propyl derivatives. Suggestions are made for enhancing selectivity at the 5-HT1A receptor or at the dopamine D2 receptor. An angular, cis, (3aR,9bS), 2-propyl, 9-hydroxy, 3-(n-propyl) analog should be selective for the 5-HT1A receptor. A linear, trans, (3aR,9aS), 7-hydroxy, 1-(2-propenyl) analog should be selective for the dopamine D2 receptor, and would be predicted to be an antagonist.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL872123,20181013,47811|122334|6604756|9882257|10014056|10014057|10105311|10105844|10332127|10355219|10377224|10466962|14944887|18988817|18988835|22849991|22849992|44266612|44266623|44266636|44266651|44266689|44274687|44274739|44275015|44275135|44275155|44275362|44275604|44275615|44275616|44275766,103170221|103170246|103170275|103170310|103170342|103170445|103171763|103171824|103171864|103171983|103175300|103193583|103193697|103193716|103193719|103193873|103194077|103194161|103194373|103194409|103194492|103194647|103194729|103194863|103195296|103195323|103195324|103195613|103195643|103244512|103700484|163333467,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8496900,0,NULL,P14416,10029,NULL,,NULL

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels. These agents should be of therapeutic value in treating disorders resulting from hypo- and hyperdopaminergic activity, without the side effects associated with complete D2 agonism or antagonism.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL850077,20200704,5374|148841|5311189|9927497|9949399|19432941|19432943|19432944|19432945|21479400|21479403|21479410|21479414|21479415|21479416|44355694|44355710|44355732|44355761|44355918|44355919|44355928|44355929|44355935|44355973|44355978|44355989|44355995|44356007|44356019|44356048|44356061|44356068|44356069|44356070|44356093|44356120|44356121|44356132|44356133|44356141|44356251|44356252|44356265|44356267|44356275|44356279|44356285|44356290|44356294|44356303|44356304|44356323|44356329|44356330|44356524|44356533|45262004|45262088|45265212,103166191|103185398|103370717|103370718|103370719|103370745|103370775|103370812|103371055|103371056|103371058|103371082|103371083|103371092|103371110|103371111|103371119|103371141|103371150|103371158|103371175|103371231|103371243|103371253|103371276|103371278|103371280|103371281|103371334|103371335|103371356|103371358|103371390|103371391|103371405|103371406|103371430|103371633|103371644|103371645|103371668|103371670|103371691|103371693|103371698|103371710|103371720|103371727|103371738|103371739|103371765|103371776|103371777|103371816|103372115|103372146|103372148|103673437|103673549|103678351,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9435894,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

This molecule was designed to conserve the essential elements contained in our D1 agonist pharmacophore model (i.e., position and orientation of the nitrogen, hydroxyls, and phenyl rings). It involved taking the backbone of dihydrexidine [3; (+/-)-trans-10, 11-dihydroxy-5,6,6a,7,8,12b-hexahydrobenzo[a] phenanthridine], the first high-affinity full D1 agonist, and tethering the two phenyl rings of dihydrexidine through a methylene bridge and removing the C(7)-C(8) ethano bridge. Preliminary molecular modeling studies demonstrated that these modifications conserved the essential elements of the hypothesized pharmacopore. Dinapsoline 4 had almost identical affinity (KI = 5.9 nM) to 3 at rat striatal D1 receptors and had a shallow competition curve (nH = 0.66) that suggested agonist properties. Consistent with this, in both rat striatum and C-6-mD1 cells, dinapsoline 4 was a full agonist with an EC50 of ca. 30 nM in stimulating synthesis of cAMP via D1 receptors. The design and synthesis of dinapsoline 4 provide a powerful test of the model of the D1 pharmacophore we have developed and provide another chemical series that can be useful probes for the study of D1 receptors. An interesting property of 3 is that it also has relatively high D2 affinity (K0.5 = 50 nM) despite having an accessory phenyl ring usually though to convey D1 selectivity. Dinapsoline 4 was found to have even higher affinity for the D2 receptor (K0.5 = 31 nM) than 3. Because of the high affinity of 4 for D2 receptors, it and its analogs can be powerful tools for exploring the mechanisms of 'functional selectivity' (i.e., that 3 is an agonist at some D2 receptors, but an antagonist at others). Together, these data suggest that 4 and its derivatives may be powerful tools in the study of dopamine receptor function and also have potential clinical utility in Parkinson's disease and other conditions where perturbation of dopamine receptors is useful.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL844901,20200704,2726|6603820|9816455,103169389|103197419|103350746,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,8558526,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1. In summary, chemical modification of 1 has resulted in compounds with high affinity and selectivity for D3 receptors.

A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1. In summary, chemical modification of 1 has resulted in compounds with high affinity and selectivity for D3 receptors. The most promising candidate, compound 29, is currently being evaluated in animal models of cocaine abuse and will provide an important tool with which to elucidate the role of D3 receptors in drug reinforcement in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL838683,20181018,9826580|9891901|9980998|10001256|10276451|11166027|11177610|11203357|11223885|11224283|11247894|11249540|11258233|11281627|11282073|11307083|11316078|11316847|11317018|11327651|11338674|11351639|11352111|11396088|11407062|11408148|11408287|11419120|11442000|11442772|11443078|11477180|11477201|11487464|11774865|44309509|44309510|44309775,103252237|103252954|103265393|103265394|103265819|103265882|103265917|103381942|103440221|103440227|103440228|103440230|103440233|103440237|103440239|103440250|103440257|103440317|103440327|103440339|103440348|103440349|103440374|103440397|103440398|103440416|103440417|103440450|103440453|103440469|103463820|103463979|103464153|103464846|103464909|103464985|103465013|103465090,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15689168,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

After validation by diagnostic experimental data, subtype-specific relative positions of TM1, 2, 6, and 7 and bending angles of TM7 were found. To sample the conformational space of the complex, we performed simulated-annealing runs of the receptor protein with the sub-nanomolar antagonist spiperone. Docking a representative set of ligands, we were able to identify one superior model for each subtype when excellent correlations between predicted energies of binding and experimental affinities (r2 = 0.72 for D2, 0.91 for D3 and 0.77 for D4) could be observed.

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1. In summary, chemical modification of 1 has resulted in compounds with high affinity and selectivity for D3 receptors. The most promising candidate, compound 29, is currently being evaluated in animal models of cocaine abuse and will provide an important tool with which to elucidate the role of D3 receptors in drug reinforcement in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL838013,20181018,9891901|9980998|10001256|10276451|11223885|11224283|11307083|11316847|11351639|11375068|11408148|11477180,103252237|103252954|103265882|103381942|103440227|103440257|103440298|103440349|103440417|103463820|103463979|103464153,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15689168,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

These three neurotransmitters have been the focus of considerable research because the modulation of their production and their interaction at monoamine receptors has profound effects upon a multitude of pharmacological outcomes. Our interest has focused on neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms in a search for medications for cocaine abuse. Herein we describe the synthesis and biological evaluation of an array of 2-aminopentanophenones. This array has yielded selective inhibitors of the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters with little effect upon serotonin trafficking.

The most potent compounds exhibited K(i) values toward the D(3) receptor in the nano- to subnanomolar range and high selectivity versus the related D(2) dopamine receptor. Thus, 1H-pyridin-2-one 7b displays oral bioavailability (F=37%) as well as brain penetration (brain plasma ratio 3.7) in rat. Within the urea series, an excellent D(3) versus D(2) selectivity (>100-fold) could be achieved by removal of one NH group (compound 6), although bioavailability (rat) was suboptimal (F<10%).

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process.

277987,Literature-derived,Activity at human D2 receptor expressed in Xenopus oocytes,"Title: Towards a new generation of potential antipsychotic agents combining D2 and 5-HT1A receptor activities._||_Abstract: We report the discovery and the synthesis of novel, potential antipsychotic compounds combining potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist properties in the same molecule. We describe the structure-activity relationship that lead us to the promising derivative: N-[(2,2-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-benzofuran-7-yloxy)ethyl]-3-(cyclopent-1-enyl)-benzylamine 16. The latter has high affinity for D2 and 5-HT1A receptors, whereas it possesses only a weak affinity for 5-HT2A sites. In cellular models of signal transduction, 16 behaves as a silent antagonist at rD2 receptors while activating h5-HT1A receptors with an efficacy at least equivalent to that of the prototypical 5-HT1A agonist (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT. These dual actions confer a unique pharmacological profile to the product. In a behavioral model predictive of positive symptoms, 16 has an activity comparable to that of the typical antipsychotic haloperidol, while it is devoid of cataleptogenic effects. Although it produces behaviors characteristic of 5-HT1A receptor activation in rats, these occur at doses 100 times higher than those with (+/-)-8-OH-DPAT. We believe that the relative balance of D2 and 5-HT1A actions in 16 is appropriate, possibly optimal, to ensure superior efficacy and tolerability over existing antipychotic drugs.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL910200,20181021,3559|9887537|10248159|16109486,103167216|103506232|103506281|103506323,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17300168,0,NULL,P14416,9606,129148,,NULL

To overcome this limitation, it was hypothesized that an alpha(1a/1d) subtype-selective antagonist would be efficacious while keeping side effects to a minimum. To discover alpha(1a/1d)-selective antagonists and improve metabolic stability of our previously reported compounds, we have designed and synthesized a series of (phenylpiperazinyl)- or (phenylpiperidinyl)-cyclohexylsulfonamides. By incorporating the information obtained from metabolism studies, we were able to discover several compounds that are both alpha(1a/1d) adrenoceptor subtype selective and show increased stability toward human liver microsomal metabolism. The selectivity profile of these compounds provides great improvement over the commercial drug tamsulosin, hence may pave the way to the development of new and efficacious therapeutic agents with reduced side effects.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL900500,20181022,11505007|11519153|11857638|11857709|11857861|11857862|44431560|44433348,103523547|103523549|103523554|103523555|103523562|103523563|103523577|103523578|103523579|103523580|103534102|103534104|103536667|103536668|103536669|103536670,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17904840,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain. These data demonstrate that acute and selective pharmacological blockade of Na(v)1.8 sodium channels in vivo produces significant antinociception in animal models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL928141,20181023,16038374,103558202,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17483457,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Unfortunately, currently marketed alpha(1) blockers produce CV-related side effects that are caused by the subtype non-selective nature of the drugs. To overcome this problem, it was postulated that an alpha(1a/1d) subtype-selective antagonist would bring more benefit for the treatment of BPH/LUTS. As a continuation of our effort to develop selective alpha(1a/1d) ligands, a series of (phenylpiperazinyl)cyclohexylureas was synthesized and evaluated for the ability to bind to three cloned human alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Several trans isomers were shown to have equal affinity for both alpha(1a), and alpha(1d) subtypes, with 14- to 47-fold selectivity versus the alpha(1b) subtype and >15-fold selectivity versus dopamine D(2).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL948052,20181023,16040907|16041090|16041091|16041092|16041263|16041264|16041265|16041449|16041451|16041628|16041629|16041630,103574537|103574538|103574577|103574579|103574621|103574661|103574662|103574702|103574746|103574748|103574794|103574841,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18055202,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

As one of our efforts to discover a new type of 5-HT(7) receptor antagonists, we here report on the synthesis and binding affinities to the 5-HT(7) receptor of the quinazolinone library 1, which was designed with various substituents (X, Y, R(1), and R(2)) on the aromatic rings and different carbon chain length. Total 85 compounds of the quinazolinone library 1 were synthesized and the binding affinities of all the synthesized compounds were obtained by radioligand binding assay for the 5-HT(7) receptor. Among the 85 compounds, 24 compounds show very good binding affinities with IC(50) values below 100 nM. Mainly the compounds with IC(50) values below 100 nM have o-OMe or o-OEt as R(2) substituent.

High-throughput screening is often plagued by low hit rates and many leads that are toxic or exhibit poor bioavailability. Exploiting the secondary activity of marketed drugs, on the other hand, may help in generating drug leads that can be optimized for the observed side-effect target, while maintaining acceptable bioavailability and toxicity profiles. Here, we describe an efficient computational methodology to discover leads to a protein target from safe marketed drugs. We applied an in silico 'drug repurposing' procedure for identification of nonsteroidal antagonists against the human androgen receptor (AR), using multiple predicted models of an antagonist-bound receptor. The library of marketed oral drugs was then docked into the best-performing models, and the 11 selected compounds with the highest docking score were tested in vitro for AR binding and antagonism of dihydrotestosterone-induced AR transactivation. The phenothiazine derivatives acetophenazine, fluphenazine, and periciazine, used clinically as antipsychotic drugs, were identified as weak AR antagonists. This in vitro biological activity correlated well with endocrine side effects observed in individuals taking these medications. Further computational optimization of phenothiazines, combined with in vitro screening, led to the identification of a nonsteroidal antiandrogen with improved AR antagonism and marked reduction in affinity for dopaminergic and serotonergic receptors that are the primary target of phenothiazine antipsychotics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL932736,20181023,1821509,103565497,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606915,0,NULL,P14416,9606,197,,NULL

The binding of these compounds to the 5-HT 7 and 5-HT 1A receptors was measured. Despite the structural similarity of these two serotonin receptor subtypes, several derivatives exhibited a high selectivity to the 5-HT 7 receptor. According to the structure-activity relationship observations, compounds unsubstituted at the oxindole nitrogen atom and containing a tetramethylene spacer between the oxindole skeleton and the basic nitrogen atom are the most potent ligands. Concerning the basic group, besides the moieties of the 4-phenylpiperazine type, halophenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridines also proved to be 5-HT 7 receptor-ligands. Because of halogen substitution on the aromatic rings, good metabolic stability could be achieved. A representative of the family, 3-{4-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-3-ethyl-6-fluoro-1,3-dihydro-2 H-indol-2-one ( 9e') exhibited selective 5-HT 7 antagonist activity ( K i = 0.79 nM).

350924,Literature-derived,Inhibition of dopamine D2S receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism of tetrahydroquinoline inhibitors of Plasmodium falciparum protein farnesyltransferase._||_Abstract: New antimalarials are urgently needed. We have shown that tetrahydroquinoline (THQ) protein farnesyltransferase (PFT) inhibitors (PFTIs) are effective against the Plasmodium falciparum PFT and are effective at killing P. falciparum in vitro. Previously described THQ PFTIs had limitations of poor oral bioavailability and rapid clearance from the circulation of rodents. In this paper, we validate both the Caco-2 cell permeability model for predicting THQ intestinal absorption and the in vitro liver microsome model for predicting THQ clearance in vivo. Incremental improvements in efficacy, oral absorption, and clearance rate were monitored by in vitro tests; and these tests were followed up with in vivo absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. One compound, PB-93, achieved cure when it was given orally to P. berghei-infected rats every 8 h for a total of 72 h. However, PB-93 was rapidly cleared, and dosing every 12 h failed to cure the rats. Thus, the in vivo results corroborate the in vitro pharmacodynamics and demonstrate that 72 h of continuous high-level exposure to PFTIs is necessary to kill plasmodia. The metabolism of PB-93 was demonstrated by a novel technique that relied on double labeling with a radiolabel and heavy isotopes combined with radiometric liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. The major liver microsome metabolite of PB-93 has the PFT Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole removed; this metabolite is inactive in blocking PFT function. By solving the X-ray crystal structure of PB-93 bound to rat PFT, a model of PB-93 bound to malarial PFT was constructed. This model suggests areas of the THQ PFTIs that can be modified to retain efficacy and protect the Zn-binding N-methyl-imidazole from dealkylation.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1022844,20180910,17758320,103530856,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,17606674,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

We initiated a program to discover orally bioavailable small molecule equivalents of these peptides. A traditional high-throughput screening approach using cAMP activation of the PTH/PTH-related peptide receptor (PPR) as a readout failed to provide any lead compounds. Accordingly, we designed a new screen for this receptor that used a modified N-terminal fragment of PTH as a probe for small molecule binding to the transmembrane region of the PPR, driven by the assumption that the pharmacological properties (agonist/antagonist) of compounds that bound to this putative signaling domain of the PPR could be altered by chemical modification. We developed DPC-AJ1951, a 14 amino acid peptide that acts as a potent agonist of the PPR, and characterized its activity in ex vivo and in vivo assays of bone resorption. In addition, we studied its ability to initiate gene transcription by using microarray technology. Together, these experiments indicated that the highly modified 14 amino acid peptide induces qualitatively similar biological responses to those produced by PTH-(1-34), albeit with lower potency relative to the parent peptide. Encouraged by these data, we performed a screen of a small compound collection by using DPC-AJ1951 as the ligand.

Radioligands for imaging with PET are required for this purpose. We synthesized new ligands from a 3,4- diarylpyrazoline platform of which (-)-12a ((-)-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-N'-[(4-cyanophenyl)sulfonyl]-4-phenyl- 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine) was found to have high-affinity and selectivity for binding to CB1 receptors. (-)-12a and its lower affinity enantiomer ((+)-12a) were labeled with carbon-11 (t1/2 ) 20.4 min) using [11C]cyanide ion as labeling agent and evaluated as PET radioligands in cynomolgus monkeys. After injection of [11C](-)-12a, there was high uptake and retention of radioactivity across brain according to the rank order of CB1 receptor densities.

The results were interpreted within the context of 5-HT 2A receptor models that suggest that members of the DOB-like series can bind to the receptor in two distinct modes that correlate with the compounds' functional activity. Automated ligand docking and molecular dynamics suggest that all of the AMDA derivatives, the parent of which is a 5-HT 2A antagonist, bind in a fashion analogous to that for the sterically demanding antagonist DOB-like compounds. The failure of the F340 (6.52)L mutation to adversely affect the affinity of AMDA and the 3-bromo derivative is consistent with the proposed modes of orientation. Evaluation of ligand-receptor complex models suggest that a valine/threonine exchange between the 5-HT 2A and D 2 receptors may be the origin of selectivity for AMDA and two substituted derivatives.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL994219,20181026,10398175|25139014|25140466,103225569|103292612|103292642,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18847250,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

However, the potent CYP3A4 inhibition activity (IC(50)=0.3 microM) of 22 precluded its further development. Detailed analysis of the X-ray crystal structure of compound 22 bound to FXa indicated that the substituent at the 6-position of the nicotinoyl group of 22 would be solvent-exposed, suggesting that efforts to attenuate the unwanted CYP activity could focus at this position without affecting FXa potency significantly.

Investigation of the structure-activity relationships revealed that small alkyl substitution at the C3 position of the indoline ring enhanced selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter (NET) over the serotonin transporter (SERT). Several compounds bearing a 3,3-dimethyl group on the indoline ring, 9k, 9o,p, and 9s,t, exhibited potent inhibition of NET (IC(50) = 2.7-6.5 nM) and excellent selectivity over both serotonin and dopamine transporters.

461920,Literature-derived,Displacement of radioligand from dopamine D2 receptor at 10 uM,"Title: Novel KCNQ2/Q3 agonists as potential therapeutics for epilepsy and neuropathic pain._||_Abstract: Current drugs for the treatment of seizure disorders, although effective in many patients, still suffer from a number of failures and are not effective in some forms of resistant epilepsies. Historically, many of these drugs have multiple mechanisms of action including calcium and sodium channel blockade as well as GABAergic activity and thus a number of associated side effects. Modulation of the M-current through opening of KCNQ channels has been proposed as a way to attenuate neuroexcitability and have a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of seizure disorders. Therefore, as part of our program to identify new treatments for epilepsy, we set out to identify agonists of KCNQ channels. High throughput screening of our corporate collection led to the identification of 1, adamantane-1-carboxylic acid (3-methyl-3H-benzothiazol-2-ylidine) hydrazide, a potent KCNQ2/Q3 agonist. Herein, we describe the syntheses and structure-activity relationships of analogues of 1 as well as their in vivo activity in animal models of epilepsy and neuropathic pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1071540,20180912,46196552|46196553|46196554,103725176|103725177|103725315,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20020710,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The goal behind this study is to delineate the nature of the binding pocket for N-aryl substitution in the piperazine ring by observing the effect of various hydrophobic and other heteroaromatic substitutions on binding affinity (K(i)), as measured with tritiated spiperone and HEK-293 cells expressing either D(2) or D(3) receptors. Functional activity of selected compounds was assessed with the GTPgammaS binding assay. Compound 8d was the most selective for the D(3) receptor in the spiperone binding assay. An interesting similarity in binding affinity was observed between isoquinoline derivative D-301 and the 2-substituted pyridine derivative 8d, suggesting the importance of relative spatial relationships between the N-atom of the ligand and the molecular determinants of the binding pocket in D(2)/D(3) receptors. Functional activity assays demonstrated high potency and selectivity of (+)-8a and (-)-28b (D(2)/D(3) (ratio of EC(50)): 105 and 202, respectively) for the D(3) receptor and both compounds were more selective compared to the reference drug ropinirole (D(2)/D(3) (ratio of EC(50)): 29.5).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1251529,20180914,681|5095|16038360|52941006,103167911|103181541|123084123|123084587,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20605099,0,NULL,P14416,9606,197,,NULL

Nitrile and fluoro substitutions at the indole 5-position gave highest hSERT potency. Preferred cyclopentane ring stereochemistry in both series was cis (1S,3R for 5-CN compound 8a, 1R,3S for 5-F compound 9a). High hSERT binding affinity was observed for 8a and 9a (0.22 and 0.63 nM, respectively).

548675,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to dopamine receptor D2,"Title: Synthesis and pharmacological properties of novel hydrophilic 5-HT4 receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important signalling molecule in the human body. The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640621,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A major problem with the first approved NNRTIs was the emergence of mutations in the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), in particular K103N and Y181C, which led to resistance to the entire class. We adopted an iterative strategy to synthesize and test small molecule inhibitors from a chemical series of pyrazoles against wild-type (wt) RT and the most prevalent NNRTI-resistant mutants. The emerging candidate, lersivirine (UK-453,061), binds the RT enzyme in a novel way (resulting in a unique resistance profile), inhibits over 60% of viruses bearing key RT mutations, with 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) within 10-fold of those for wt viruses, and has excellent selectivity against a range of human targets. Altogether lersivirine is a highly potent and selective NNRTI, with excellent efficacy against NNRTI-resistant viruses.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1691870,20180918,16739244,103708524,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20660667,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Such changes were expected to be almost isosteric with 1, confer greater metabolic resistance, and in the case of the 4-(4-cyanotetrahydro-2H-pyranyl) compounds, substantially reduce lipophilicity. One derivative, 1-(2-bromophenyl)-N-(1-cyanocyclohexyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide (9n), showed high affinity (K(i) = 15.7 nM) and selectivity for binding to CB(1) receptors.

In this series, we discovered some of the most D3R selective compounds reported to date (e.g., 8d and 8j, >1000-fold D3R-selective over D2R).

Moreover, addition of the halomethylketone moiety to reversible inhibitors turned them into irreversible inhibitors with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range.

We set out to discover novel, neutral 5-HT(6)R antagonists to improve off-target selectivity compared to basic amine-containing scaffolds dominating the field. High-throughput screening identified the N'-(sulfonyl)pyrazoline-1-carboxamidine scaffold as a promising neutral core for starting hit-to-lead. Medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, small molecule NMR and X-ray crystallography were subsequently applied to optimize the leads into antagonists (compounds 1-49) displaying high 5-HT(6)R affinity with optimal off-target selectivity. Unique structural features include a pseudoaromatic system and an internal hydrogen bond freezing the bioactive conformation. While physicochemical properties and CNS availability were generally favorable, significant efforts had to be made to improve metabolic stability.

Standard treatment, targeting monoamine transporters selective for the neurotransmitters serotonin and noradrenaline, is not able to help many patients that are poor responders. This study advances the development of sazetidine-A analogues that interact with α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) as partial agonists and that possess favorable antidepressant profiles. The resulting compounds that are highly selective for the α4β2 subtype of nAChR over α3β4-nAChRs are partial agonists at the α4β2 subtype and have excellent antidepressant behavioral profiles as measured by the mouse forced swim test. Preliminary absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies for one promising ligand revealed an excellent plasma protein binding (PPB) profile, low CYP450-related metabolism, and low cardiovascular toxicity, suggesting it is a promising lead as well as a drug candidate to be advanced through the drug discovery pipeline.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1838255,20200629,56595309,134450722,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21905669,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The molecule conformational flexibility in the series is restricted by formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between 3-sulfo and 2-methylamino groups, which renders high potency and high selectivity to block serotonin-induced responses in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human 5-HT(6)R. In this work, we tested the hypothesis if addition of a positively ionizable group (PI) to the pyrimidine ring of the scaffold members in positions 5, 6, or 7 could further increase their 5HT(6)R blocking potency. We show that the presence of the PI group with small substituents does not substantially affect either potency or selectivity of the ligands while causing substantial changes in their cLogP values. This provides a possibility for designing of the 5HT(6)R ligands with modified ADME characteristics without grossly affecting efficiency of their interaction with the receptor. In respect to the structure-activity relationship (SAR), among other physiochemical parameters, only the molecule size and shape (described by gyration radii) showed a clear tendency for more compact molecules to be more potent antagonists of this receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1925005,20180920,56655504,136939345,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22029285,0,NULL,P14416,NULL,NULL,,NULL

These ligands were labeled with the short-lived positron emitter fluorine-18 and analyzed for their potential application for imaging studies by positron emission tomography (PET).

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects.

The 4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine compounds (3i-l) have a higher affinity for 5-HT(1A) receptors than do the corresponding unsubstituted phenylpiperazine analogues (3e-h).

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS.

Clinical utility of nonselective sodium channel blockers is limited due to serious adverse drug effects. Here, we present the optimization, structure-activity relationships, and in vitro and in vivo characterization of a novel series of Na(V)1.7 inhibitors based on the oxoisoindoline core. Extensive studies with focus on optimization of Na(V)1.7 potency, selectivity over Na(V)1.5, and metabolic stability properties produced several interesting oxoisoindoline carboxamides (16A, 26B, 28, 51, 60, and 62) that were further characterized. The oxoisoindoline carboxamides interacted with the local anesthetics binding site. In spite of this, several compounds showed functional selectivity versus Na(V)1.5 of more than 100-fold. This appeared to be a combination of subtype and state-dependent selectivity. Compound 28 showed concentration-dependent inhibition of nerve injury-induced ectopic in an ex vivo DRG preparation from SNL rats. Compounds 16A and 26B demonstrated concentration-dependent efficacy in preclinical behavioral pain models.

Biosynthetically the structural skeletons of cyclomarinone (1) and maristachones A (2), C (4), D (5a), and E (5b) are most unusual due to the presence of an additional carbon atom when compared to the basic polyketide skeleton. This special biosynthetic feature also holds true for the likewise isolated polyketide marilactone (6).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2341830,20180926,71658646,164138116,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23268694,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Current therapeutic treatment for obesity is mostly focused on preventive measures involving dietary control and physical exercises in combination with anti-obesity medications. However, most of these anti-obesity medications have little or no effect on weight loss, and some cases have demonstrated fatal side effects. Due to the urgent need for highly potent and selective anti-obesity agents, the serotonin receptors (5-HTR) have been the focus of much interest as a novel therapeutic target. In this report, we have developed pyrimidoazepine analogs targeting the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and evaluated their biological activity in vitro and in vivo as novel anti-obesity agents. We were able to identify 6p as the most potent 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C ligand in vitro (IC50 = 3 nM and 2.3 nM, respectively), and this compound also demonstrated the greatest potency in vivo. In an acute obesity model, mice treated with 6p showed significant decrease in body weight gain and food intake over approximately 77-94% compared to a control group. In a chronic obesity model, mice treated with 6p also showed a marked decrease in food intake and body weight gain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2396124,20180927,73347435|73348966|73355004|73356562,174491594|174496661|174517283|174522465,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23537943,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

The major drawback of C-11 tracers is the lack of cyclotron facility in many health care centers thereby limiting widespread clinical or research use. We identified the fluoroethyl derivative, 2-(4-(4-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione (FECUMI-101) (Ki=0.1nM; Emax=77%; EC50=0.65nM) as a partial agonist 5-HT1AR ligand of the parent ligand CUMI-101. FECUMI-101 is radiolabeled with F-18 by O-fluoroethylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue (1) with [(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate in DMSO in the presence of 1.6equiv of K2CO3 in 45±5% yield (EOS). PET shows [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binds specifically to 5-HT1AR enriched brain regions of baboon. The specificity of [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binding to 5-HT1AR was confirmed by challenge studies with the known 5-HT1AR ligand WAY100635. These findings indicate that [(18)F]FECUMI-101 can be a viable agonist ligand for the in vivo quantification of high affinity 5-HT1AR with PET.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2416736,20200629,21830793|73346042,174487458|174487459,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23816046,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Therefore, GPCRs are involved in diverse physiological processes and provide valuable drug targets for numerous diseases. Emerging body of evidence suggests that GPCRs exist as monomers or cross-react forming dimers and higher-ordered oligomers.

Current research focuses on two aspects of polypharmacology: (1) unintended polypharmacology can lead to adverse effects; (2) polypharmacology across several disease-relevant targets can improve therapeutic efficacy, prevent drug resistance, or reduce therapeutic-target-related adverse effects. This perspective reviews these interconnected aspects of polypharmacology. The first part discusses the relevance of polypharmacology for the safety of drugs, the mitigation of safety risks, and methods to identify polypharmacological compounds early in the drug discovery process. The second part discusses the advantages of polypharmacology in the treatment of multigenic diseases and infections, and opportunities for drug discovery and drug repurposing.

Agonist D2/3 tracers for PET/SPECT imaging are considered to be superior to antagonists because they are more sensitive to dopamine concentrations and may selectively label the high-affinity receptor state. Carbon-11-labeled D2/3R agonists have been developed, but these short-lived tracers can be used only in centers with a cyclotron. Here, we report the development of a series of novel D2R agonist compounds based on the 2-aminomethylchromane (AMC) scaffold that provides ample opportunities for the introduction of longer-lived [(18)F] or [(123)I]. Binding experiments showed that several AMC compounds have a high affinity and selectivity for D2/3R and act as agonists. Two fluorine-containing compounds were [(18)F]-labeled, and both displayed specific binding to striatal D2/3R in rat brain slices in vitro. These findings encourage further in vivo evaluations.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3117739,20200620,57532|65340|11957529|44356251|76314267|76321553|76325149|76325151|76325155|76328712|76328714|76336021,103371644|103580657|103678385|160682083|194146768|194160603|194167505|194167506|194167508|194174341|194174342|194188090,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24325578,0,NULL,P14416,9606,45,,NULL

Incorporation of a basic amino function in the C3 position together with substitution at the C6 position produced novel coumarin compounds with selectivity for the MAO A subtype. Substitution in the C6 position with small hydrophilic groups such as hydroxy (19, IC50 = 1.46 μM) or amino (18, IC50 = 3.77 μM) gave the most potent and selective compounds for MAO A. These compounds also showed excellent aqueous solubility properties.

1073059,Confirmatory,Agonist activity at dopamine D2 receptor (unknown origin),"Title: A perspective on natural products research and ethnopharmacology in Mexico: the eagle and the serpent on the prickly pear cactus._||_Abstract: Mexico's extraordinarily rich cultural and floristic diversity has fascinated explorers and researchers ever since the 'New World' was discovered for and by Europeans. For many decades, natural product research has been a very active field of research in Mexico, and there also are some ongoing ethnopharmacological research efforts. This review provides an overview and critical appraisal on some key developments in these fields and examples of medicinal plants used by indigenous communities that have become of great local importance in Mexican popular medicine. In this review, the focus is on plants with effects on the CNS, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory processes, and gastrointestinal disorders. While some of the major food plants consumed worldwide originate from southern North America, only very few medicinal plants have become of major global importance. Opuntia species are now used increasingly to manage diabetes and metabolic syndrome and represent an example of a novel medicinal product/supplement. Undoubtedly, narcotic and mind-altering drugs both have received the widest scientific interest and have attracted considerable popular attention. The history of use of the indigenous Mexican Materia Medica in the context of research on local and popular resources specifically with regard to the diverse challenges in the context of studying the world's biodiversity and the development of comparative and semiquantitative ethnobotanical research methods is discussed herein. Natural product and ethnopharmacological research in Mexico seems to have been influenced by the political and societal developments originating from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and subsequent conventions, which have not yet had the desired effect of giving value to these local resources, as they might deserve. Their equitable and sustainable implementation remains a challenge. Natural product research and ethnopharmacology will play a key role in developing an adequate evidence base for such products derived from local and traditional knowledge in Mexico.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3131489,20180929,91588,194154860,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24559070,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Many scaffold modifications were largely tolerated, resulting in nanomolar-potent compounds in the H3R functional assay. Exemplar compound 6s demonstrated a selective profile against a panel of 144 secondary pharmacological receptors, with activity at only σ2 (62% at 10 μM). Compound 6s demonstrated free-plasma exposures above the IC50 (∼50×) with a brain-to-plasma ratio of ∼3 following intravenous dosing in mice. At three doses tested in the mouse novel object recognition model (1, 3, and 10 mg/kg s.c.), 6s demonstrated a statistically significant response compared with the control group.

In this work, we use the structurally-related clozapine-olanzapine pair to progress in the understanding of the structural properties that determine their divergent binding profiles and, thereby, their differing therapeutic efficacy. First, we present novel site-directed mutagenesis results that confirm our previous hypothesis on the importance of ligand interaction with positions 5.42 and 5.46 in transmembrane helix 5. Then, we use refined models of ligand-receptor complexes, built from recently published GPCR crystal structures, to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed experimental outcomes. In particular, we observe that preventing or potentiating hydrogen bonding with position 5.46, could allow obtaining ligands with, respectively, clozapine or olanzapine-like affinities.

EBI2 is highly expressed in immune cells ( J. Biol. Chem. 2006 , 281 , 13199 ), and its activation has been shown to be critical for the adaptive immune response and has been genetically linked to autoimmune diseases such as type I diabetes ( Nature 2010 , 467 , 460 ). Here we describe the isolation of a potent small molecule antagonist for the EBI2 receptor. First, we identified a small molecule agonist NIBR51 (1), which enabled identification of inhibitors of receptor activation. One antagonist called NIBR127 (2) was used as a starting point for a medicinal chemistry campaign, which yielded NIBR189 (4m). This compound was extensively characterized in binding and various functional signaling assays. Furthermore, we have used 4m to block migration of a monocyte cell line called U937, suggesting a functional role of the oxysterol/EBI2 pathway in these immune cells.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3266168,20181003,36295259,242636124,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24678947,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Although they were affected by conjugation, the binding affinities were found to be still in the nanomolar range (between 1.5 and 64.2 nM). In addition, homology modeling of the receptor and docking studies for the most potent compounds were performed, elucidating the binding modes of the fusion molecules and the structure elements contributing to the observed high receptor binding. Furthermore, no interaction between the hybrid compounds and P-gp, the main excretory transporter of the BBB, was found. From these results, it can be inferred that the approach to deliver small neuroreceptor ligands across the BBB by transport peptide carriers is feasible.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3265956,20181003,2726|3559|37461|3033769|10021692|10169960|90643433|90643434|90656834|90656835|90656836|90656837|90656838|90656839|90656840|90656841|90656842|90656843|90656844|90656845|90656846|90656847|90656848|90656849|90656850|90656851|90656852|90656853|90656854|90656855|90656856|90656857|90656858,103167216|103167993|103169389|103545123|123090849|242638288|242638289|242638290|242638291|242638292|242638293|242638294|242638295|242638296|242638297|242638298|242638299|242638567|242638568|242638569|242638570|242638571|242638572|242638573|242638574|242638575|242638576|242638577|242638578|242638579|242638580|242638581|242638582,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24779610,0,NULL,P14416,9606,45,,NULL

Compound optimization led to the identification of potent mGlu2/3 selective PAMs with no in vitro activity at mGlu1,4-8 or 45 other CNS receptors. In vitro pharmacological characterization of representative compound 44 indicated agonist-PAM activity toward mGlu2 and PAM activity at mGlu3. The most potent mGlu2/3 PAMs were characterized in assays predictive of ADME/T and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, allowing the discovery of systemically active mGlu2/3 PAMs. On the basis of its overall profile, compound 74 was selected for behavioral studies and was shown to dose-dependently decrease cocaine self-administration in rats after intraperitoneal administration.

Thus, selective D4 ligands may be useful in treating some of these conditions. Previous studies in our laboratory have indicated that the piperazine analog of haloperidol exhibits selective and increased affinity to the DAD4 receptor subtype, in comparison to its piperidine analog. This led to further exploration of the piperazine moiety to identify new agents that are selective at the D4 receptor. Compound 27 (KiD4=0.84 nM) was the most potent of the compounds tested. However, it only had moderate selectivity for the D4 receptor. Compound 28 (KiD4=3.9 nM) while not as potent, was more discriminatory for the D4 receptor subtype. In fact, compound 28 has little or no binding affinity to any of the other four DA receptor subtypes. In addition, of the 23 CNS receptors evaluated, only two, 5HT1AR and 5HT2BR, have binding affinity constants better than 100 nM (Ki <100 nM). Compound 28 is a potentially useful D4-selective ligand for probing disease treatments involving the D4 receptor, such as assisting smoking cessation, reversing cognitive deficits in schizophrenia and treating erectile dysfunction.

In vitro studies confirmed their antagonism of 5-HT(7/2A) and D2 receptors and weak interactions with key antitargets (M1R and hERG) associated with side effects. Marked 5-HT6 receptor affinities were also observed, notably for 6-fluoro-3-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2-benzoxazole derivatives connected by a 3-4 unit alkyl linker with mono- or bicyclic, lipophilic arylsulfonamide moieties. N-[4-[4-(6-Fluoro-1,2-benzoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl]butyl]benzothiophene-2-sulfonamide (72) was characterized in vitro on 14 targets and antitargets. It displayed dual blockade of 5-HT6 and D2 receptors and negligible interactions at hERG and M1 receptors. Unlike reference antipsychotics, 72 displayed marked antipsychotic and antidepressant activity in rats after oral administration, in the absence of cognitive or motor impairment.

Exploitation of the original structure-activity relationships resulted in the identification of safe and effective antipsychotics devoid of extrapyramidal symptoms liability, sedation, and catalepsy. The potential atypical antipsychotic 5bb was selected for further pharmacological investigation. The distribution of c-fos positive cells in the ventral striatum confirmed the atypical antipsychotic profile of 5bb in agreement with behavioral rodent studies. 5bb administered orally demonstrated a biphasic effect on the MK801-induced hyperactivity at dose levels not able to induce sedation, catalepsy, or learning impairment in passive avoidance. In microdialysis studies, 5bb increased the dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex.

The vast structural diversity of this group of polyketides is largely introduced by enzymatic oxidations, which can significantly influence the bioactivity profile. Four new compounds, griseorhodins D-F, were isolated from a griseorhodin producer, Streptomyces sp. CN48+, based upon their enhancement of calcium uptake in a mouse dorsal root ganglion primary cell culture assay. Two of these compounds, griseorhodins D1 and D2, were shown to be identical to the major, previously uncharacterized products of a grhM mutant in an earlier griseorhodin biosynthesis study. Their structures enabled the establishment of a more complete hypothesis for the biosynthesis of griseorhodins and related compounds.

1185963,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]N-methylspiperone from human dopamine D2 receptor by liquid scintillation counting,"Title: Further evaluation of the tropane analogs of haloperidol._||_Abstract: Previous work from our labs has indicated that a tropane analog of haloperidol with potent D2 binding but designed to avoid the formation of MPP(+)-like metabolites, such as 4-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-oxobutyl)pyridin-1-ium (BCPP(+)) still produced catalepsy, suggesting a strong role for the D2 receptor in the production of catalepsy in rats, and hence EPS in humans. This study tested the hypothesis that further modifications of the tropane analog to produce compounds with less potent binding to the D2 receptor than haloperidol, would produce less catalepsy. These tests have now revealed that while haloperidol produced maximum catalepsy, these compounds produced moderate to low levels of catalepsy. Compound 9, with the least binding affinity to the D2R, produced the least catalepsy and highest Minimum Adverse Effective Dose (MAED) of the analogs tested regardless of their affinities at other receptors including the 5-HT1AR. These observations support the hypothesis that moderation of the D2 binding of the tropane analogs could reduce catalepsy potential in rats and consequently EPS in man.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3366156,20181006,3559|13091268|13091356|13091359|21527771|21533446|57403525|76518514|118709750|118709751|135398745,103167216|103195217|103488767|136922797|136932519|136945472|312351717|312351718|312351719|312351720|312351721,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25070422,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, development of druglike lead compounds with selectivity for the D3 receptor has been challenging because of the high sequence homology between the D3R and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R). In this effort, we synthesized a series of acylaminobutylpiperazines incorporating aza-aromatic units and evaluated their binding and functional activities at the D3 and D2 receptors. Docking studies and results from evaluations against a set of chimeric and mutant receptors suggest that interactions at the extracellular end of TM7 contribute to the D3R versus D2R selectivity of these ligands.

Prototype hybrid molecules were designed using docking to receptor homology models. Diverse pharmacophore moieties yielded 3 series of hybrids with varying in vitro properties at 5-HT6R and D2R, and at M1 receptor and hERG channel antitargets. 4-(piperazin-1-yl)-1H-indole derivatives showed highest antagonist potency at 5-HT6R, with 7-butoxy-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one and 2-propoxybenzamide derivatives having promising D2R partial agonism. 2-(3-(4-(1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indol-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propoxy)benzamide (47) exhibited nanomolar affinity at both 5-HT6R and D2R and was evaluated in rat models. It displayed potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like activity in the Porsolt and Vogel tests, respectively, more pronounced than that of a reference selective 5-HT6R antagonist or D2R partial agonist. In addition, 47 also showed antidepressant-like activity (Porsolt's test) and anxiolytic-like activity (open field test) in aged (>18-month old) rats. In operant conditioning tests, 47 enhanced responding for sweet reward in the saccharin self-administration test, consistent with anti-anhedonic properties. Further, 47 facilitated extinction of non-reinforced responding for sweet reward, suggesting potential procognitive activity.

We have previously disclosed a structure- and property-guided lead optimization effort which resulted in the discovery of a new series of tetrahydroindazole-containing selective ITK inhibitors. Herein we disclose further optimization of this series that resulted in further potency improvements, reduced off-target receptor binding liabilities, and reduced cytotoxicity. Specifically, we have identified a correlation between the basicity of solubilizing elements in the ITK inhibitors and off-target antiproliferative effects, which was exploited to reduce cytotoxicity while maintaining kinase selectivity. Optimized analogues were shown to reduce IL-2 and IL-13 production in vivo following oral or intraperitoneal dosing in mice.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3429291,20181006,74983355,242650963,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25844760,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor.

A common molecular template used in the development of D3R-selective antagonists and partial agonists incorporates a butylamide linker between two pharmacophores, a phenylpiperazine moiety and an extended aryl ring system. The series of compounds described herein incorporates a change to that chemical template, replacing the amide functional group in the linker chain with a 1,2,3-triazole group. Although the amide linker in the 4-phenylpiperazine class of D3R ligands has been previously deemed critical for high D3R affinity and selectivity, the 1,2,3-triazole moiety serves as a suitable bioisosteric replacement and maintains desired D3R-binding functionality of the compounds. Additionally, using mouse liver microsomes to evaluate CYP450-mediated phase I metabolism, we determined that novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing compounds modestly improves metabolic stability compared to amide-containing analogues. The 1,2,3-triazole moiety allows for the modular attachment of chemical subunit libraries using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click chemistry, increasing the range of chemical entities that can be designed, synthesized, and developed toward D3R-selective therapeutic agents.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3591124,20181008,25141534|72190766|118719792|122180568|122180569|122180570|122180571|122180572|122180573|122180574|122180575|122180576|122180610|122180611|122180612|122180613|122180614|122180615|122180616|122180617|122180618|122180619|122180620|122180621|122180622|122180623|122180624|122180625|122180626|122180627|122181005|122181006|122181007,124966353|174493497|312367617|318375884|318375885|318375886|318375887|318375888|318375889|318375890|318375891|318375892|318375953|318375954|318375955|318375956|318375957|318375958|318375959|318375960|318375961|318375962|318375963|318375964|318375965|318375966|318375967|318375968|318375969|318375970|318376629|318376630|318376631,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25650314,0,NULL,P14416,9606,45,,NULL

D3R-selective compounds with high affinity and varying efficacies have been discovered, providing critical research tools for cell-based studies that have been translated to in vivo models of drug abuse. D3R antagonists and partial agonists have shown especially promising results in rodent models of relapse-like behavior, including stress-, drug-, and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.

D3R-selective compounds with high affinity and varying efficacies have been discovered, providing critical research tools for cell-based studies that have been translated to in vivo models of drug abuse. D3R antagonists and partial agonists have shown especially promising results in rodent models of relapse-like behavior, including stress-, drug-, and cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking.

We report that a series of novel indoline-2-carboxamides have been identified as inhibitors of Trypanosoma brucei from screening of a focused protease library against Trypanosoma brucei brucei in culture. We describe the optimization and characterization of this series. Potent antiproliferative activity was observed.

This highly potent molecular scaffold was developed from an inactive diarylpyridine-2-amine derivative 3b by extensive and systematic analogue synthesis and SAR analysis. Further optimization of the scaffold resulted in identification of pyridin-2(1H)-one 18b as a lead compound with good potency (IC50 = 1.6 nM) and selectivity (>6000-fold) over other related PDEs but with a poor pharmacokinetic profile. Careful metabolite profiling of 18b revealed that poor systemic exposure in rats (Cmax = 44 ng/mL; AUC0-t = 359 ng · h/mL) at 10 mg/kg was due to the formation of O-glucuronide conjugate by phase 2 metabolism. The structure of the glucuronide metabolite was confirmed by retention time and LC-MS/MS fragmentation matching with the synthetic glucuronide 26. The problem of low exposure of 18b was effectively addressed by its conversion to an acetate prodrug 25b, which upon oral dosing resulted in an improved pharmacokinetic profile (Cmax = 359 ng.h/mL; AUC0-t = 2436 ng.h/mL) and a desirable brain to plasma ratio of 1.2.

The presence of branched allylic substituent groups diminished affinity for the h5HT2A receptor. Likewise, the alkynyl, nitrile and ester derivatives evaluated displayed lower 5-HT2A receptor affinity as compared to 5. Hydrophobic, steric and electronic effects impact the affinity of p-substituted benzyl derivatives 8i-8k but in different ways. High hydrophobicity and size favor 5-HT2A affinity whereas, high electronegativity disfavors 5-HT2A affinity. p-Bromobenzyl analog 8k was identified as a 5-HT2A receptor selective ligand, with the highest 5-HT2A receptor affinity of any aporphine known to date. Most of the other analogs were selective for the 5-HT2A versus the α1A receptor.

Several D3R-selective modulators over the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) can avoid extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and hyperprolactinemia. However, few biased D3R ligands were identified or showed a narrow range of selectivity at the D3R over D2R because of their high sequence homology. Herein, we designed, synthesized and evaluated the binding affinity of a series of bitopic ligands: arypiperazine-phenyl-1,2,4-oxadiazoles.

1272382,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to D2 dopamine receptor (unknown origin) by competition binding assay,"Title: Receptor binding profiles and quantitative structure-affinity relationships of some 5-substituted-N,N-diallyltryptamines._||_Abstract: N,N-Diallyltryptamine (DALT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) are two tryptamines synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin. In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values. At the σ2 receptor, higher affinity was correlated with increasing π. These correlations should aid in the development of more potent and selective drugs within this family of compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3756490,20200623,24839550|50878551|127026052|127036186|127036932|127036953,174496429|336866908|336883200|336884944|336884983|336885079,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26739781,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

The functional activity studied through the measurement of 5-HT7R-mediated cyclic AMP production in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells (HEK293) stably expressing human 5-HT7 proved their antagonistic properties.

The process of selection of candidates for synthesis was supported by a special molecular modeling workflow including combinatorial library generation, docking, and machine learning-based assessment. Additionally, in silico predictions of selectivity over 5-HT1AR and D2R, as well as functional activity were carried out.

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

Docking of the C10 analogues at the D3 receptor, suggest that an ionic interaction between the protonated nitrogen atom and Asp110, a H-bond interaction between the C2 phenol and Ser192, a H-bond interaction between the C10 phenol and Cys181 as well as hydrophobic interactions of the aryl rings to Phe106 and Phe345, are critical for high affinity of the compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3783174,20200623,127031398,336874671,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27032890,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Despite this, identification of a potent small molecule tool possessing pharmacokinetic properties allowing for robust in vivo target coverage has been challenging. Here we describe the optimization of a potent, selective series of quinazolinone-based TRPA1 antagonists. High-throughput screening identified 4, which possessed promising potency and selectivity. A strategy focused on optimizing potency while increasing polarity in order to improve intrinsic clearance culminated with the discovery of purinone 27 (AM-0902), which is a potent, selective antagonist of TRPA1 with pharmacokinetic properties allowing for >30-fold coverage of the rat TRPA1 IC50 in vivo.

They not only presented potent activities for D2, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A receptors, but were also endowed with low activities for 5-HT2C, H1 receptors and hERG channels, suggesting a low propensity of inducing weight gain and QT prolongation. In animal models, compounds 21 and 22 reduced phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity with a high threshold for catalepsy induction. It thus provides potential candidates for further preclinical studies.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3806885,20180906,60795,103307946,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27173799,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Here, we report the synthesis of thirty long-chain arylpiperazine analogs of the selective and brain penetrant 5-HT7 receptor agonist LP-211 (1) designed to enhance stability towards microsomal oxidative metabolism. Commonly used medicinal chemistry strategies were used (i.e., reduction of overall lipophilicity, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups, blocking of potential vulnerable sites of metabolism), and in vitro microsomal stability was tested. The data showed that the adopted design strategy does not directly translate into improvements in stability. Instead, the metabolic stability of the compounds was related to the presence of specific substituents in well-defined regions of the molecule. The collected data allowed for the construction of a machine learning model that, in a given chemical space, is able to describe and quantitatively predict the metabolic stability of the compounds.

Here, we report the synthesis of thirty long-chain arylpiperazine analogs of the selective and brain penetrant 5-HT7 receptor agonist LP-211 (1) designed to enhance stability towards microsomal oxidative metabolism. Commonly used medicinal chemistry strategies were used (i.e., reduction of overall lipophilicity, introduction of electron-withdrawing groups, blocking of potential vulnerable sites of metabolism), and in vitro microsomal stability was tested. The data showed that the adopted design strategy does not directly translate into improvements in stability. Instead, the metabolic stability of the compounds was related to the presence of specific substituents in well-defined regions of the molecule. The collected data allowed for the construction of a machine learning model that, in a given chemical space, is able to describe and quantitatively predict the metabolic stability of the compounds. The majority of the synthesized compounds maintained high affinity for 5-HT7 receptors and showed selectivity towards 5-HT6 and dopamine D2 receptors and different selectivity for 5-HT1A and α1 adrenergic receptors.

Schizophrenia and depression are examples of such diseases and their pharmacotherapy thus depends on agents which target multiple receptors including the dopamine, serotonin and even cholinergic receptors at the same time. In our previous campaign to find multi-receptor ligands, we have identified the benzothiazole 1a as an initial lead molecule. In the current work, we have expanded the structure affinity relationship (SAFIR) of 1a resulting in the identification of a partially restrained butyrophenone 3j as a potent and selective dual 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor ligand.

Analysis of the medicinal chemistry parameters of the 3,5-substituents of derivatives of template 5 enabled us to design a class of drug-like molecules with lower intrinsic clearance and higher oral bioavailability which led to the novel RARα agonist 4-(3-chloro-4-ethoxy-5-isopropoxybenzamido)-2-methylbenzoic acid 56 that has high RARα potency and excellent selectivity versus RARβ (2 orders of magnitude) and RARγ (4 orders of magnitude) at both the human and mouse RAR receptors with improved drug-like properties.

We have explored the structure-activity relationship of a 3-(4-phenyl-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-1-yl)-5-(aryl)benzoic acid antagonist scaffold, assisted by docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation at a P2Y14R homology model. A computational pipeline using the High Throughput MD Python environment guided the analogue design. Selection of candidates was based upon ligand-protein shape and complementarity and the persistence of ligand-protein interactions over time. Predictions of a favorable substitution of a 5-phenyl group with thiophene and an insertion of a three-methylene spacer between the 5-aromatic and alkyl amino moieties were largely consistent with empirical results. The substitution of a key carboxylate group on the core phenyl ring with tetrazole or truncation of the 5-aryl group reduced affinity. The most potent antagonists, using a fluorescent assay, were a primary 3-aminopropyl congener 20 (MRS4458) and phenyl p-carboxamide 30 (MRS4478).",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4189962,20200618,126720252,404686172,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767967,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

A series of eleven new N-(phenoxyalkyl)- or N-{2-[2-(phenoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}piperazine derivatives has been obtained. Their affinity towards 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, D2 and α1 receptors has been assessed, and then functional assays were performed. The compounds were evaluated in mice, i.p. for their antidepressant-like (forced swim test), locomotor, anxiolytic-like (four-plate test) activities as well as - at higher doses - for anticonvulsant potential (MES) and neurotoxicity (rotarod). Two compounds (3, 6) were also evaluated for their analgesic activity in neuropathic pain models (streptozocin test, oxaliplatin test) and they were found active against allodynia in diabetic neuropathic pain at 30 mg/kg. Among the compounds, anxiolytic-like, anticonvulsant or analgesic activity was observed but antidepressant-like activity was not. One of the two most interesting compounds is 1-{2-[2-(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxy)ethoxy]ethyl}-4-(2-methoxyphenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (9), exhibiting anxiolytic and anticonvulsant activity in mice, i.p. 30 min after administration (at 2.5 mg/kg and ED50 = 26.33 mg/kg, respectively), which can be justified by the receptor profile: 5-HT1A Ki = 5 nM (antagonist), 5-HT7 Ki = 70 nM, α1 Ki = 15 nM, D2 Ki = 189 nM (antagonist). Another interesting compound is 1-[3-(2,4,6-trimethylphenoxy)propyl]-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)piperazine dihydrochloride (3), exhibiting anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and antiallodynic activity in mice, i.p., 30 min after administration (at 10 mg/kg, ED50 = 23.50 mg/kg, at 30 mg/kg, respectively), which can be related with 5-HT1A weak antagonism (Ki = 146 nM), or other possible mechanism of action, not evaluated within presented study.

Preclinical data link the 5-HT7R to a variety of central nervous system processes including the regulation of circadian rhythms, mood, cognition, pain processing, and mechanisms of addiction. 5-HT7R blockade has antidepressant effects and may ameliorate cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. 5-HT7R has been recently shown to modulate neuronal morphology, excitability, and plasticity, thus contributing to shape brain networks during development and to remodel neuronal wiring in the mature brain. Therefore, the activation of 5-HT7R has been proposed as a therapeutic approach for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders associated with abnormal neuronal connectivity. This Perspective celebrates the silver jubilee of the discovery of 5-HT7R by providing a survey of recent studies on the medicinal chemistry of 5-HT7R ligands and on the neuropharmacology of 5-HT7R.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4199279,20200618,132525569|132525570,404676945|404695019,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29767995,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

All known D1-selective agonists are catecholamines that bring about receptor desensitization and undergo rapid metabolism, thus limiting their utility as a therapeutic for chronic illness such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease. Our high-throughput screening efforts on D1 yielded a single non-catecholamine hit PF-4211 (6) that was developed into a series of potent D1 receptor agonist leads with high oral bioavailability and CNS penetration. An important structural feature of this series is the locked biaryl ring system resulting in atropisomerism. Disclosed herein is a summary of our hit-to-lead efforts on this series of D1 activators culminating in the discovery of atropisomer 31 (PF-06256142), a potent and selective orthosteric agonist of the D1 receptor that has reduced receptor desensitization relative to dopamine and other catechol-containing agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4260966,20200619,75201901,404702213,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30431269,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

The compounds generally displayed strong affinity for D3R with very good D3R selectivity. Docking studies at D2R and D3R crystal structures revealed that the molecules are oriented such that their arylamine units are positioned in the orthosteric binding pocket of D3R, with the arylamide 'tail' units residing in the secondary binding pocket. Hydrogen bonding between Ser 182 and Tyr 365 at D3R stabilize extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which in turn contributes to ligand binding by interacting with the 'tail' units of the ligands in the secondary binding pocket. Similar interactions between ECL2 and the 'tail' units were absent at D2R due to different positioning of the D2R loop region.

Inspired by this time-tested moiety, medicinal chemists have widely explored its use in developing bioactive molecules because of the possibility to (1) increase target engagement, potency, and selectivity through van der Waals interactions and entropically favorable restriction to a bioactive conformation, (2) mitigate toxicity, (3) obtain superior DMPK profile, (4) modulate the p Ka of nearby functionality, (5) induce symmetry into a monomethyl substituted chiral center, and (6) apply the Thorpe-Ingold conformational effect in an o-hydroxydihydrocinnamic acid based prodrug design. The aim of this Perspective is to illustrate how medicinal chemists have elegantly employed the gem-dimethyl group to obtain clinically useful drugs and to provide synthetic methods to install a gem-dimethyl group.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4037101,20200621,2477|55191,103166970|103209962,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28850227,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

To rationalize the experimental observations and derive information about receptor-ligand interactions of the reported ligands, docking studies, using 5-HT1A and α1d-AR models generated by homology techniques, and a retrospective computational study were performed. The results highlighted that proper substituents in position 2 of the phenoxy moiety of 3 selectively address the ligands toward 5-HT1A receptor with respect to α1-ARs and D2-like receptor subtypes.

1462158,Literature-derived,Displacement of [3H]-sp iperone from dopamine D2 receptor (unknown origin) at 1 uM,"Title: Chiral-pool synthesis of 1,2,4-trisubstituted 1,4-diazepanes as novel σ1 receptor ligands._||_Abstract: Starting from enantiomerically pure amino acids, 1,4-diazepanes with various substituents in 1, 2, and 4-position were synthesized following the late stage diversification strategy. The key step in the formation of the seven-membered ring was the intramolecular EDC coupling of amino acids 15, 26, and 39. The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models. The compounds did not inhibit the structurally related fungal enzyme sterol Δ8,7-isomerase, but showed inhibition of diverse enzymes in late cholesterol biosynthesis at high concentrations. In a screening against more than 50 target proteins, (2S)-1-benzyl-4-(4-methoxybenzyl)-2-methyl-1,4-diazepane ((S)-28b, Ki(σ1)=0.86nM) showed a clean receptor profile. The dose dependent potentiation of electrically stimulated contractions of guinea pig vas deferens indicates σ1 agonistic activity of (S)-28b. Even at a dose of 100mg/kg (S)-28b did not induce severe toxic or behavioral effects in the Irwin screen. Clear cognition enhancing effects were observed for (S)-28b after inducing amnesia by scopolamine.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4044949,20200621,132609385,381854110,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28764962,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

It not only exhibited potent and balanced activities for D2, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2A receptors, but was also endowed with low activities for α1A, 5-HT2C, H1 receptors and hERG channels, suggesting a low propensity for inducing orthostatic hypotension, weight gain and QT prolongation. In animal models, compound 10d reduced phencyclidine-induced hyperactivity with a high threshold for catalepsy induction.

To better understand the structural features required for the selective interaction with the D4R and to obtain compounds unable to activate mAChRs, the aliphatic butyl chain and the piperidine nucleus of 1 were modified, affording compounds 2-14. The 4-benzylpiperidine 9 and the 4-phenylpiperazine 12 showed high D4R affinity and selectivity not only over the other D2-like subtypes, but also over M1-M5 mAChRs. Derivative 12 was also highly selective over some selected off-targets. This compound showed biased behavior, potently and partially activating Gi protein and inhibiting β-arrestin2 recruitment in functional studies.

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations. These receptor models bound with partial agonists may be useful for structure-based design of compounds with tailored efficacy profiles.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4052936,20200622,10456166|42626240|42626318|58358826|122181006|137635743|137639330|137647150|137648255|137653517|137656298|137657276,103402070|124961101|124969027|163334704|318376630|381843105|381848416|381859990|381861617|381869422|381873560|381879252,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27983845,0,NULL,P14416,9606,45,,NULL

Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation._||_Abstract: A series of 1- and 2-naphthyloxy derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for histamine H3 receptor affinity. Most compounds showed high affinities with Ki values below 100 nM. The most potent ligand, 1-(5-(naphthalen-1-yloxy)pentyl)azepane (11) displayed high affinity for the histamine H3 receptor with a Ki value of 21.9 nM. The antagonist behaviour of 11 was confirmed both in vitro in the cAMP assay (IC50 = 312 nM) and in vivo in the rat dipsogenia model (ED50 = 3.68 nM). Moreover, compound 11 showed positive effects on scopolamine induced-memory deficits in mice (at doses of 10 and 15 mg/kg) and an analgesic effect in the formalin test in mice with ED50 = 30.6 mg/kg (early phase) and ED50 = 20.8 mg/kg (late phase). Another interesting compound, 1-(5-(Naphthalen-1-yloxy)pentyl)piperidine (13; H3R Ki = 53.9 nM), was accepted for Anticonvulsant Screening Program at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institute of Health (Rockville, USA). The screening was performed in the maximal electroshock seizure (MES), the subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ) and the 6-Hz psychomotor animal models of epilepsy.

Compound 16 modulated 5-HT2CR-mediated spontaneous ambulation, partially substituted for the training dose of the 5-HT2CR agonist WAY163909, synergized with a low dose of WAY163909 to substitute fully for the stimulus effects of WAY163909, and attenuated relapse vulnerability as assessed in a rodent self-administration model, indicating its therapeutic promise for CUD.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4309152,20210302,71575525,440129674,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29620897,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

This ligand comprises a thieno[2,3- d]pyrimidine scaffold that does not feature in known dopaminergic ligands. Herein, we provide pharmacological validation of an allosteric mode of action for 1, revealing that it is a NAM of dopamine efficacy and identify the structural determinants of this allostery.

Our first HIF-2α inhibitor PT2385 demonstrated promising proof of concept clinical activity in heavily pretreated advanced ccRCC patients. However, PT2385 was restricted by variable and dose-limited pharmacokinetics resulting from extensive metabolism of PT2385 to its glucuronide metabolite. Herein we describe the discovery of second-generation HIF-2α inhibitor PT2977 with increased potency and improved pharmacokinetic profile achieved by reduction of phase 2 metabolism. Structural modification by changing the geminal difluoro group in PT2385 to a vicinal difluoro group resulted in enhanced potency, decreased lipophilicity, and significantly improved pharmacokinetic properties.

To discover new and potential D1/D2 ligands, 17 derivatives of tetrahydroprotoberberine (THPB) with various substituents were prepared by chemical synthesis or microbial transformation using Streptomyces griseus ATCC 13273. Their functional activities on D1 and D2 receptors were determined by cAMP assay and calcium flux assay. Seven compounds showed high activity on D1/D2 receptor with low IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 1 µM. Especially, top compound 5 showed strong antagonistic activity on both D1 and D2 receptor with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 0.391 and 0.0757 µM, respectively. Five compounds displayed selective antagonistic activity on D1 and D2 receptor.

Misuse of prescription and illegal opioids (e.g., morphine, heroin) has led to major problems with addiction and overdose. We used vincamine, an indole alkaloid, as a synthetic starting point for dramatic structural alterations of its complex, fused ring system to synthesize 80 diverse compounds with intricate molecular architectures. A select series of vincamine-derived compounds were screened for both agonistic and antagonistic activities against a panel of 168 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) drug targets. Although vincamine was without an effect, the novel compound 4 (V2a) demonstrated antagonistic activities against hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2. When advanced to animal studies, 4 (V2a) significantly prevented acute morphine-conditioned place preference (CPP) and stress-induced reinstatement of extinguished morphine-CPP in mouse models of opioid reward and relapse. These results demonstrate that the ring distortion of vincamine offers a promising way to explore new chemical space of relevance to opioid addiction.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4344218,20210302,8969|15376|153284501|153284511|153284538|153284543|155541143|155544367|155557362,103177857|103763450|440127932|440158554|440166524|440167986|440188842|440199078|440229557,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31913038,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Two isoquinoline derivatives, 1-(2'-bromobenzyl)-6,7-dihydroxy-N-methyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline (Br-BTHIQ, 1) and 1,2-demethyl-nuciferine (aporphine, 2), were herein synthesized, and their dopaminergic affinity in cloned human D2R, D3R, and D4R subtypes and their behavior as agonists/antagonists were evaluated. They showed affinity values (Ki) for hD2, hD3, and hD4 DR within the nanomolar range.

This hypothesis has been tested using a benchmark series of 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R antagonists obtained by coupling variously substituted 2-aminoimidazole moieties to the well established 1-benzenesulfonyl-1H-indoles, which served as the ligands cores. The crystallographic studies revealed that upon protonation, the 2-aminoimidazole fragment triggers a resonance driven conformational change leading to a form of higher affinity. This molecular switch may be responsible for the observed differences in 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R activity of the studied chemotypes with different amine-like fragments. Considering the multiple functionalization sites of the embedded guanidine fragment, diverse libraries were constructed, and the relationships between the structure and activity, metabolic stability, and solubility were established. Compounds from the N-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)acylamide chemotype (10a-z) exhibited high affinity for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R and very high selectivity over 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> receptors (negligible binding), which was attributed to their very weak basicity.

Compound 9 was subjected to X-ray studies and it crystallizes in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P2<sub>1</sub>/c with one molecule in an asymmetric unit. Three most potent compounds (5, 9 and 17) turned out to be antagonists of both D<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors what is beneficial for their potential application as antipsychotics.

In this context, fluorine substitution can influence the potency, conformation, metabolism, membrane permeability, and P-gp recognition of a molecule and temper inhibition of the hERG channel by basic amines. However, as a consequence of the unique properties of fluorine, it features prominently in the design of higher order structural metaphors that are more esoteric in their conception and which reflect a more sophisticated molecular construction that broadens biological mimesis.

Sustained research has sought to identify selective ligands for receptor subtypes. In particular, activation of the D<sub>1</sub> receptor has attracted attention due to its promising role in neurological diseases. Initial attempts to identify agonists yielded catechol derivatives, mimicking dopamine, with suboptimal DMPK parameters and low selectivity over the D<sub>5</sub> subtype. However, more recent efforts to identify ligands capable of activating the D<sub>1</sub> receptor have made substantial progress with the identification of non-catechol agonists with suitable properties to progress to clinical studies. In addition, several research groups have identified positive allosteric modulators that offer new potential. Furthermore, structural studies have surprisingly uncovered two potential allosteric binding sites, the most characterized of which appears to be on intracellular loop 2 (ICL2). This review highlights the recent progress in the field, covering both orthosteric and allosteric modes of activation, discusses the elucidation of the allosteric binding sites, and summarizes the clinical development status of various compounds.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4372473,20210302,155541775,440160090,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30525590,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase catalytic activity of the tankyrases (TNKS/TNKS2) has been reported to reduce the Wnt/β-catenin signal by preventing poly ADP-ribosylation-dependent degradation of AXIN, a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. With the goal of investigating the effects of tankyrase and Wnt pathway inhibition on tumor growth, we set out to find small-molecule inhibitors of TNKS/TNKS2 with suitable drug-like properties. Starting from 1a, a high-throughput screening hit, the spiroindoline derivative 40c (RK-287107) was discovered as a potent TNKS/TNKS2 inhibitor with >7000-fold selectivity against the PARP1 enzyme, which inhibits WNT-responsive TCF reporter activity and proliferation of human colorectal cancer cell line COLO-320DM. RK-287107 also demonstrated dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition in a mouse xenograft model.

The insufficient quality of the available molecular probes prompted design of fluorinated 3-(1-alkyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-1H-indoles as a new generation of selective 5-HT7 receptor agonists. A potent and drug-like agonist, 3-(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-5-yl)-5-iodo-4-fluoro-1H-indole (AGH-192, 35, Ki 5-HT7R = 4 nM), was identified by optimizing the halogen bond formation with Ser5.42 as the supposed partner. The compound was characterized by excellent water solubility, high selectivity over related CNS targets, high metabolic stability, oral bioavailability and low cytotoxicity. Rapid absorption into the blood, medium half-life and a high peak concentration in the brain Cmax = 1069 ng/g were found after i.p. (2.5 mg/kg) administration in mice. AGH-192 may thus serve as the long-sought tool compound in the study of 5-HT7 receptor function, as well as a potential analgesic, indicated by the antinociceptive effect observed in a mouse model of neuropathic pain.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4394035,20210302,60854|138691314|138691316|138691317|138691321|138691329|138691338|138691362|138691364|138691366|139488518|139488527|139488539|139488606|139488740|155512944|155538144|155538367|155540147|155543250|155545625|155546350|155551353|155556527|155557443|155561901|155563286|155566925|155569396,103194712|404685415|404692512|440110608|440113423|440117930|440119853|440127451|440128541|440132232|440138910|440140123|440146134|440151969|440152310|440156317|440163688|440168576|440169695|440171545|440183981|440197106|440199174|440199285|440200499|440210578|440214095|440223337|440229555,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30904783,0,NULL,P14416,9606,45,,NULL

At the same time, inhibiting protein-protein interactions (PPI) is increasingly desired in the treatment of disorders or diseases. The development of non-peptidomimetic inhibitors is still a challenge. Herein we investigate macrocyclic scaffolds with one or two embedded carbohydrates (MECs) that present amino acid side chains, or related isosteres, as pharmacophoric groups. Firstly, retroscreening of the previously reported eannaphane-40 (E40, 40), a MEC presenting two pharmacophoric groups, against a set of 55 receptor-subtypes led to a finding of sub-micromolar inhibitory activity for E40 against three serotonergic isoforms (5HT1A/2A/2B) as well as the Na+ channel and the NK-2 receptor. We synthesised MECs with an additional pharmacophoric group compared to E40, with a view to identifying compounds where the selectivity profile was altered among the protein hits from the retroscreening. MECs were produced based on scaffolds with two monosaccharide residues, leading to the incorporation of a third pharmacophoric group. Later, homology models were prepared for four proteins (5HT1A, 5HT2A, NK2 and site-2 of the sodium channel) whose 3D structure is unknown. Inverse docking of the synthesised compounds led to the selection of a new MEC (MEC-B) for protein binding assays. MEC-B was found to have its selectivity profile modulated, in line with docking prediction, compared to E40. MEC-B is dual inhibitor of both 5-HT1A and the sodium channel with improved selectivity for these proteins compared to 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT transporter and NK2 receptor. Thus, a new multitargeting compound, with an improved selectivity profile was identified, based on a MEC peptidomimetic scaffold.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4396164,20210302,155565189,440218835,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31112891,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

Herein, we present derivatives of 1 with comparable D<sub>3</sub>R affinity (32, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 3.2 nM, D<sub>2</sub>R/D<sub>3</sub>R ratio = 60) and selectivity (30, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 21.0 nM, D<sub>2</sub>R/D<sub>3</sub>R ratio = 934).

Counterscreening of the hit compounds provided an assessment of their selectivity, efficacy, and potency. The most promising scaffold was optimized through medicinal chemistry resulting in enhanced potency and selectivity. The optimized compound, ML417 (20), potently promotes D3R-mediated β-arrestin translocation, G protein activation, and ERK1/2 phosphorylation (pERK) while lacking activity at other dopamine receptors. Screening of ML417 against multiple G protein-coupled receptors revealed exceptional global selectivity.

In this frame, following our interest in the development of molecules able to modulate either the endocannabinoid or the dopaminergic system, and given the multiple and reciprocal interconnections between them, we decided to merge the pharmacophoric elements of some of our early leads for identifying new molecules as tools able to modulate both systems. We herein describe the synthesis and biological characterization of compounds 5a-j inspired by the structure of our potent and selective fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors (3a-c) and ligands of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes (4a,b). Notably, the majority of the new molecules showed a nanomolar potency of interaction with the targets of interest. The drug-likeliness of the developed compounds (5a-j) was investigated in silico while hERG affinity, selectivity profile (for some proteins of the endocannabinoid system), cytotoxicity profiles (on fibroblast and astrocytes), and mutagenicity (Ames test) were experimentally determined. Metabolic studies also served to complement the preliminary drug-likeliness profiling for compounds 3a and 5c. Interestingly, after assessing the lack of toxicity for the neuroblastoma cell line (IMR 32), we demonstrated a potential anti-inflammatory profile for 3a and 5c in the same cell line.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4409079,20210302,1383884|155518672|155520675|155535169|155536374|155540919|155541938|155542534|155550192|155555589|155560181,103455066|440122063|440125288|440147407|440149276|440158009|440160477|440161941|440181107|440194824|440206255,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31518969,0,NULL,P14416,9606,197,,NULL

Further optimization led to a series of analogues that replaced the 3-OH with a 3-F in the linker between the primary pharmacophore (PP) and secondary pharmacophore (SP). Among the 3-F-compounds, <b>9b</b> demonstrated the highest D<sub>3</sub>R binding affinity (<i>K</i><sub>i</sub> = 0.756 nM) and was 327-fold selective for D<sub>3</sub>R over D<sub>2</sub>R. In addition, modification of the PP or SP with a 3,4-(methylenedioxy)phenyl group was also examined.

Both drugs are dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonists, with contrasting kinetic profiles. Haloperidol displays fast association/slow dissociation at the D2R, whereas clozapine exhibits relatively slow association/fast dissociation. Recently, we have provided evidence that slow dissociation from the D2R predicts hyperprolactinemia, whereas fast association predicts EPS. Unfortunately, clozapine can cause severe side effects independent of its D2R action. Our results suggest an optimal kinetic profile for D2R antagonist APDs that avoids EPS. To begin exploring this hypothesis, we conducted a structure-kinetic relationship study of haloperidol and revealed that subtle structural modifications dramatically change binding kinetic rate constants, affording compounds with a clozapine-like kinetic profile.

A preponderance of preclinical data and clinical observations established p38αMAPK as a brain drug discovery target involved in neuroinflammatory responses and synaptic dysfunction in multiple degenerative and neuropsychiatric brain disorders. We summarize the discovery of highly selective, brain-penetrant, small molecule p38αMAPK inhibitors that are efficacious in diverse animal models of neurologic disorders. A crystallography and pharmacoinformatic approach to fragment expansion enabled the discovery of an efficacious hit.

Guided by both phenotypic and protein degradation data, we describe a series of CELMoDs for the treatment of RRMM, culminating in the discovery of CC-92480, a novel protein degrader and the first CELMoD to enter clinical development that was specifically designed for efficient and rapid protein degradation kinetics.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4628564,20210802,58389169|137379028,442049991|442060839,1813,NULL,P14416,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,32130004,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL

The D<sub>2</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptors are among the most important receptor targets in the treatment of schizophrenia, but antagonism at 5-HT<sub>6</sub> and 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors may bring about additional improvement of cognitive functions. However, doubt exists regarding the importance of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R in the pharmacotherapy. In 2010, lurasidone (with high affinity for D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>, 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors) was approved for the treatment of schizophrenia. Due to the efficacy of the mentioned drug and doubts related to the role of 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R, we decided to obtain compounds with an activity profile similar to that of lurasidone, but with the reduced affinity for 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R and increased affinity for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R. For this purpose, we chose aflexible hexyl derivative of lurasidone (2-(6-(4-(benzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-yl)hexyl)hexahydro-1H-4,7-methanoisoindole-1,3(2H)-dione 1a) as a hit structure. After molecular modeling, we modified it, in the area of the arylpiperazine and imide group, using the moieties found in other known CNS drugs. We received the compounds in accordance with the previously developed method of ecological synthesis in the microwave radiation field. Among the obtained compounds, N-(6-(4-(benzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-yl)hexyl)naphthalene-sulfonamides 1v and 1w were distinguished as multifunctional ligands showing increased affinity for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R, and 2-(6-(4-(benzo[d]isothiazol-3-yl)piperazin-1-yl)hexyl)-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyridin-3(2H)-one 1i - a multifunctional ligand showing moderate affinity for 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R and threefold lower for 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R.

A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent.

1921,Other,Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Colleen Niswender_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator(PAM)_||_Grant Number: MH077607-1_||_To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

485344,Screening,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Primary Screen for Antagonists,"NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831-01_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley_||_Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

485347,Screening,HTS Assay for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Primary Screen for Potentiators,"NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831-01_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley_||_Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

485358,Screening,HTS Assay for Allosteric Agonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Primary Screen for Agonists,"NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831-01_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley_||_Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

624453,Confirmatory,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Hit Validation in primary assay,"Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling.

624463,Other,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Antagonists,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR). This assay seeks to identify antagonists against the D2 DAR._||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network [MLPCN]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_Grant: NS0676421_||_PI Name: David

624464,Other,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Potentiators,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR).

624465,Other,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Agonists,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties. _||_To this end, a miniaturized qHTS screen was developed to be screened against the Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR).

624469,Summary,Beta-Arrestin HTS for Positive Allosteric Modulators of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: Antagonist Summary,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways.

624494,Other,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: SAR in D2 Binding Assay,"Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line.

The present project is looking for compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D2 cell line, which act through an allosteric site._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS064831_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2700,20120817,133633|16007752|16007814|16007816|16007818|16007820|16007841|17171662|20861039|20861041|57377245|57377246|57377247|57377248|57377249|57383397|57383398|57383399|57383400|57383401|57383402|57383403|57383404|57383405|57383406|57383407|57383408|57383409|57383410|57383411|57383412|57383413|57383414|57383415|57383416|57383417|57383418|57383419|57383420|57383421|57383422|57383423|57383424|57383425|57383426|57383427|57383428|57383429|57383430|57383431|57383432|57383434|57383435|57383436|57383437,124880521|136882616|136882617|136882618|136882619|136882620|136889446|136889447|136889448|136889449|136889450|136889451|136889452|136889453|136889454|136889455|136889456|136889458|136889459|136889460|136889461|136889462|136889463|136889464|136889465|136889466|136889467|136889468|136889469|136889470|136889471|136889472|136889473|136889474|136889475|136889476|136889477|136889478|136889479|136889480|136889481|136889482|136889483|136889484|136889485|136889486|136889487|136889488|136889489|136889491|136889492|136889493|136889494|136889495|136889496,1813,NULL,NP_000786,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,NULL,0,NULL,P14416,9606,NULL,,NULL
