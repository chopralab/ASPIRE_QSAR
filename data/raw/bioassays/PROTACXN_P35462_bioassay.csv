   45420,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]-spiperone from CHO-K1 cell membranes expressing human dopamine 3 receptors,"Title: Evaluation of the effects of the enantiomers of reduced haloperidol, azaperol, and related 4-amino-1-arylbutanols on dopamine and sigma receptors._||_Abstract: The enantiomers of reduced haloperidol (3a), azaperol (3b), and the related compound BMY-14802 (3c) were prepared in high optical purity. The affinity of these compounds for dopamine D2 and D3 receptors, and sigma S1 and S2 sites was determined in vitro. Both enantiomers of 3a display greatly decreased affinity for D2 and D3 receptors compared to haloperidol, although they still possess affinities in the 100-200-nM range. Both enantiomers of 3a possess potent and equal affinity for S1 sites (Ki: 1-2 nM), only slightly weaker than haloperidol (Ki: 0.33 nM). At S2 sites, (R)-(+)-3a displays similar affinity to haloperidol (Ki: 31 and 26 nM, respectively), while (S)-(-)-3a is slight more potent (Ki: 8.2 nM). The stereoselectivity profile of the enantiomers of 3b at D2 and D3 receptors is quite similar to that of 3a, (S)-(-)-3b being about 4 times more potent than its enantiomer at both receptors. (R)-(+)-3b binds preferentially to sigma S1 over S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3b displays the opposite selectivity profile. Both enantiomers of 3c possess very weak affinity for D2 and D3 receptors. In a manner similar to the enantiomers of 3b, the affinity of (R)-(+)-3c is greater for S1 than S2 sites, while (S)-(-)-3c displays the opposite selectivity profile. Following parenteral administration of both enantiomers of 3a, dopamine synthesis and turnover in rat striatum, cortex, and mesolimbic areas were increased, in a manner similar to the effects produced by haloperidol itself. Additional studies will be required to assess with certainty whether the effects were due to the compounds themselves or simply were a consequence of the in vivo oxidation to haloperidol.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL651365,20181014,3559|15443|6604868|10020651|16048564|24867245|44350942|44350991,103167216|103359590|103359652|103359654|103359671|103359710|103359798|103359799,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7902870,0,NULL,P35462,9606,198,,NULL

The only structural feature which distinguishes 7 from the analogous nonselective naphthoxazines is an oxygen atom in the 6-position. To extend this series of tricyclic DA agonists we used a classic bioisoster approach and synthesized thiopyran analogues of 7, which have a sulfur atom in the 6-position. We prepared trans-4-n-propyl-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-[1]benzothiopyrano[4, 3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol (9, trans-9-OH-PTBTO), its enantiomers ((+)-9 and (-)-9), the racemic cis-analogue (10), and the racemic trans-sulfoxide (11) and studied the potency and selectivity for DA receptors of these compounds. As with other rigid DA agonists, the highest affinity for DA receptors resided in one of the enantiomers, in this case the (-)-enantiomer of 9. On the basis of a single-crystal X-ray analysis of a key intermediate, the absolute configuration of (-)-9 was found to be 4aS,10bR, which is homochiral with (+)-(4aR,10bR)-7. In contrast to (+)-7 however, (-)-9 displayed no selectivity for any of the DA receptors. In addition, it has affinity for 5HT1A receptors. (+/-)-cis-4-n-Propyl-3,4,4a,10b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-[1]benzothiopyrano++ +[4,3-b]-1,4-oxazin-9-ol (10), which was expected to be inactive, displayed affinity and selectivity for the DA D3 receptor, whereas the sulfoxide 11 displayed some DA D3 selectivity, but with a lower affinity. Further pharmacological evaluation revealed that (-)-9 is a very potent full agonist at DA D2 receptors and a partial agonist at DA D3 receptors. The cis-analogue (+/-)-10 displayed the same profile, but with lower potency. These findings were confirmed in vivo: in reserpinized rats (-)-9 displayed short-acting activation of locomotor activity (DA D2 agonism) and also lower lip retraction and flat body posture, (5HT1A agonism). Compound (+/-)-10 had no effect on locomotor activity. In unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, (-)-9 gave short-acting locomotor activation. Furthermore, in microdialysis studies in rat striatum, (-)-9 potently decreased DA release, confirming its activation of presynaptic DA D2 receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL673332,20181016,57533|115107|5311346|10015731|10515841|10683127|44329483|44329749|44329754,103265086|103265119|103312093|103312146|103312624|103312625|103312626|103312634|103312640,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,10956195,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670422,20181016,54562,103543557,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e.

Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model.

Optimization studies were carried out on 8 with the aim of achieving 1000-fold selectivity for hD(4) over all other receptors while retaining the good pharmacokinetic properties of the lead. After initial preparation of 8 as a minor component in a low-yielding reaction, a novel and regioselective 'four-step/one-pot' procedure was developed which proved to be applicable to rapid investigation of the SAR of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one ring. Various changes to substituents attached to the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one core of 8 did not significantly improve selectivity for hD(4) over hD(2) and hD(3).

However, definitive behavioral investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly selective D3 agonists and antagonists. In an attempt to design a novel class of D3 ligands with which to study this receptor system, a series of chemically divergent compounds that possessed various structural features that exist within several classes of reputed D3 agents was screened and compared to the recently reported NGB 2904 (58b). On the basis of these results, a novel series of compounds was designed that included functional moieties that were required for high-affinity and selective binding to D3 receptors. All the compounds in this series included an aryl-substituted piperazine ring, a varying alkyl chain linker (C3-C5), and a terminal aryl amide. The compounds were synthesized and evaluated in vitro for binding in CHO cells transfected with human D2, D3, or D4 receptor cDNAs. D3 binding affinities ranged from K(i) = 1.4 to 1460 nM. The most potent analogue in this series, 51, demonstrated a D3/D2 selectivity of 64 and a D3/D4 selectivity of 1300.

Targetting high affinity and D(3) versus D(2) receptor-preferring ligands, the partial agonist BP 897 was taken as a lead structure. Variations in the spacer and the aryl moiety led to N-alkylated 1-(2-methyoxyphenyl)piperazines with markedly improved affinity and selectivity. Molecular modeling studies supported the structural development. Pharmacophore models for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptor ligands were developed from their potentially bioactive conformation and were compared in order to get insight into molecular properties of importance for D(2)/D(3) receptor selectivity. For the 72 compounds presented here, an extended and more linear conformation in the aliphatic or aryl spacers turned out to be crucial for dopamine D(3) receptor selectivity. Structural diversity in the aryl moiety (benzamides, heteroarylamides, arylimides) had a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D(3) receptor affinity, which was optimized with more rigid aryl acrylamide derivatives.

The affinities of the compounds for [3H]raclopride-labeled cloned human dopamine (DA) D2 and D3 receptors as well as [3H]-8-OH-DPAT-labeled rat hippocampal 5-HT1A receptors were determined. In order to selectively determine affinities for the high-affinity agonist binding site at DA D2 receptors, the agonist [3H]quinpirole was used. The intrinsic activities of the compounds at DA D2 and D3 receptors were evaluated in a [35S]GTP gamma S binding assay. The novel compounds were characterized as dopaminergic antagonists or inverse agonists. The antagonist (R)-2-(butylpropylamino)-5-fluorotetralin (16) bound with high affinity (Ki = 4.4 nM) to the DA D3 receptor and was the most D3-selective compound (10-fold). (R)-2-[[4-(8-Aza-7, 9-dioxospiro[4.5]decan-8-yl)butyl]propylamino]-5-fluorote tralin (18) bound with very high affinity to both DA D3 and 5-HT1A receptors (Ki = 0.2 nM) and was also characterized as a dopaminergic antagonist. (R)-2-(Benzylpropylamino)-5-fluorotetralin (10) behaved as an inverse agonist at both DA D2 and D3 receptors. It decreased the basal [35S]GTP gamma S binding and potently inhibited the DA-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding.

Discovery of a novel scaffold which embraces the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Structure-activity relationships of a series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans._||_Abstract: A series of 2-(aminomethyl)chromans (2-AMCs) was synthesized and evaluated for their affinity and selectivity for both the high- and low-affinity agonist states (D2High and D2Low, respectively) of the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor. The 7-hydroxy-2-(aminomethyl)chroman moiety was observed to be the primary D2 agonist pharmacophore. The 2-methylchroman moiety was discovered to be an entirely novel scaffold which could be used to access the D2 agonist pharmacophore. Attaching various simple alkyl and arylalkyl side chains to the 7-hydroxy 2-AMC nucleus had significant effects on selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the 5HT1A and alpha 1 receptors. A novel DA partial agonist, (R)-(-)-2-(benzylamino)methyl)chroman-7-ol [R-(-)-35c], was identified as having the highest affinity and best selectivity for the D2High receptor vs the alpha 1 and 5HT1A receptors. Several regions of the 2-AMC nucleus were modified and recognized as potential sites to modulate the level of intrinsic activity. The global minimum conformer of the 7-hydroxy-2-AMC moiety was identified as fulfilling the McDermed model D2 agonist pharmacophoric criteria and was proposed as the D2 receptor-bound conformation. Structure-activity relationships gained from these studies have aided in the synthesis of D2 partial agonists of varying intrinsic activity levels.

Dopamine autoreceptor agonists and potential antipsychotic agents._||_Abstract: A novel dopamine (DA) autoreceptor agonist, 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenyl-1- [(3-phenyl-3-cyclohexen-1-yl)methyl]pyridine (14), was identified. The structure-activity relationships surrounding this compound were studied by synthesis of analogues and evaluation of their dopaminergic activity. The cyclohexene substitution pattern was varied along with the length of the chain connecting the 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine to the cyclohexene. Compound 14, having the 1,3-substitution pattern and a single methylene chain, was the most potent. The 1,2,3,6-tetrahydro-4-phenylpyridine could be replaced by other aryl-cyclic amines with a slight loss in activity. The phenyl group on the cyclohexene ring could be para substituted; electron-donating groups were better tolerated than electron-withdrawing groups. Finally, the enantiomers of 14 were resolved via the 1,1'-binaphthyl-2,2'-diyl hydrogen phosphate salts. Although both isomers were partial DA agonists, the (+)-enantiomer had higher intrinsic activity than the (-)-enantiomer. Syntheses were developed that allowed rapid preparation of analogues.

Four separate parts of the molecule have been examined systematically to explore structure-activity relationships with respect to hD4 affinity and selectivity over other dopamine receptors. It was found that the 4-chlorophenyl group attached to the pyrazole is optimal, as is the 4-substituted piperidine. The lipophilic group on the basic nitrogen is more amenable to change, with the optimal group found to be a phenethyl. The aromatic heterocyle can be altered to a number of different groups, with isoxazoles and pyrimidines showing improved affinities. This heterocycle can also be advantageously alkylated, improving the selectivity of the compounds over D2 receptors. It is hypothesized that the conformation around the bond joining the aromatic heterocycle to the piperidine is important for D4 affinity, based on crystal structures of isoxazoles (29 and 30) and on a conformationally constrained compound (28). Putting all the favorable changes together led to the discovery that 5-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-methyl-3-(1-(2-phenylethyl)piperidin-4-yl)iso xazole (36) is a nanomolar antagonist at human dopamine D4 receptors with > 500-fold selectivity over hD2 and > 200-fold selectivity over hD3.

This approach has provided dopamine (DA) agonists with good oral availability. To further explore its use in the development of DA agonists, we have combined the 2-aminothiazole moiety with 2-aminoindans and 3-aminobenzopyrans, which are known templates for DA agonists. In this study we have synthesized 6-amino-3-(N,N-di-n-propylamino)-3,4-dihydro-2H-thiazolo[5, 4-f]-[1]benzopyran (12) and 6-amino-2-(N, N-di-n-propylamino)thiazolo[4,5-f]indan (20) and several analogues (13, 17, and 21). The affinity of the thiazolobenzopyrans and thiazoloindans for DA receptors was evaluated, which revealed compound 20 to have high affinity for DA D(3) receptors. In addition, the compounds were screened for their potential to inhibit lipid peroxidation, to determine their radical scavenging properties. Compounds 12, 20, and 21 were subjected to further pharmacological evaluation in a functional assay to determine intrinsic activity. Compound 20 was also studied with microdialysis (to determine effects on DA turnover in striatum) and in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats (to determine their potential as DA agonists). These studies selected compound 20 (GMC 1111) as particularly interesting. Compound 20 caused a rotation activation in unilaterally 6-OH-DA lesioned rats and an increase in DA turnover in rat striatum. This dual agonist/antagonist action is best accounted for by its partial agonism at striatal DA D(2) receptors. Interestingly, 20 displayed long-lasting activity and excellent oral availability in 6-OH-DA lesioned rats, making this compound potentially useful for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL676636,20181016,9904074|10220541|10590717|10637198|10780928,103345940|103345942|103345968|103345969|103346651,1814,In vitro,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,11000009,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,198,,NULL

However, a major disadvantage of many current medications are the observed extrapyramidal side-effects (EPS), postulated to arise from D(2) receptor antagonism. Consequently, a selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist could offer an attractive antipsychotic therapy, devoid of the unwanted EPS. Using SAR information gained in two previously reported series of potent and selective D(3) receptor antagonists, as exemplified by the 2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine 10 and the 2,3-dihydro-1H-isoindoline 11, a range of 7-sulfonyloxy- and 7-sulfonylbenzazepines has been prepared. Compounds of this type combined a high level of D(3) affinity and selectivity vs D(2) with an excellent pharmacokinetic profile in the rat. Subsequent optimization of this series to improve selectivity over a range of receptors and reduce cytochrome P450 inhibitory potential gave trans-3-(2-(4-((3-(3-(5-methyl-1,2,4-oxidiazolyl))phenyl)carboxamido)cyclohexyl)ethyl)-7-methylsulfonyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine (58, SB-414796). This compound is a potent and selective dopamine D(3) receptor antagonist with high oral bioavailability and is CNS penetrant in the rat. Subsequent evaluation in the rat has shown that 58 preferentially reduces firing of dopaminergic cells in the ventral tegmental area (A10) compared to the substantia nigra (A9), an observation consistent with a prediction for atypical antipsychotic efficacy. In a separate study, 58 has been shown to block expression of the conditioned place preference (CPP) response to cocaine in male rats, suggesting that it may also have a role in the treatment of cue-induced relapse in drug-free cocaine addicts.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL674272,20181017,45262323|45262339|45262343|45262345|45262347|45262348|45262349|45262363|45262369|45262381|45262384|45262385|45262402|45262403|45262404|45262410|45262412|45262415|45262416|45262417|45264008|45265219|45265240|45265244|45265257|45265266|45265305|45265589|45265590|45265597|45265605|45265612|45265633,163312675|163316033|163319496|163329760|163336742|174484820|174484821|174489875|174500115|174500117|174505298|174515586|174515587|174515589|174520684|174520685|174520686|194137837|194137838|194151548|194151549|194151552|194158572|194158575|194158576|194165503|194165506|194165508|194172363|194172365|194172370|194186050|194186053,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14584946,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,197,,NULL

In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670710,20181017,5202,103165719,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930145,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A cross-species study on the metabolism of (R)-3 in vitro has shown large variations in the extent of metabolism from species to species. Imidazoquinolinones (R)-5 and (R)-6 have comparable activity to (R)-3 in animals and also show good dopaminergic (D2) and serotonergic (5HT1A) activities in binding assays.

These compounds were evaluated for their binding profiles in several membrane preparations: Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells expressing dopamine D2 (non-GTP coupled, low-affinity states) and D3 receptors, HEK293 cells expressing dopamine D2 receptors in high-affinity states (D2H), rat hippocampal homogenates for 5-HT1A receptors, and cerebellar homogenates for sigma receptors.

The discovery of 20m (PRX-00023), N-{3-[4-(4-cyclohexylmethanesulfonylaminobutyl)piperazin-1-yl]phenyl}acetamide, and its backup compounds, followed a new paradigm, driving the entire discovery process with in silico methods and seamlessly integrating computational chemistry with medicinal chemistry, which led to a very rapid discovery timeline. The program reached clinical trials within less than 2 years from initiation, spending less than 6 months in lead optimization with only 31 compounds synthesized. In this paper we detail the entire discovery process, which started with modeling the 3D structure of 5-HT1A using the PREDICT methodology, and then performing in silico screening on that structure leading to the discovery of a 1 nM lead compound (8). The lead compound was optimized following a strategy devised based on in silico 3D models and realized through an in silico-driven optimization process, rapidly overcoming selectivity issues (affinity to 5-HT1A vs alpha1-adrenergic receptor) and potential cardiovascular issues (hERG binding), leading to a clinical compound. Finally we report key in vivo preclinical and Phase I clinical data for 20m tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and show that these favorable results are a direct outcome of the properties that were ascribed to the compound during the rational structure-based discovery process.

Two aryloxyanilides with high affinity for PBR were identified and synthesized, namely, N-acetyl- N-(2-methoxycarbonylbenzyl)-2-phenoxyaniline ( 3, PBR01) and N-(2-methoxybenzyl)- N-(4-phenoxypyridin-3-yl)acetamide ( 10, PBR28). 3 was hydrolyzed to 4, which was esterified with [ (11)C]iodomethane to provide [ (11)C] 3. The O-desmethyl analogue of 10 was converted into [ (11)C] 10 with [ (11)C]iodomethane. [ (11)C] 3 and [ (11)C] 10 were each injected into monkey to assess their brain kinetics with positron emission tomography (PET). After administration of either radioligand there was moderately high brain uptake of radioactivity. Receptor blocking and displacement experiments showed that a high proportion of this radioactivity was bound specifically to PBR. In monkey and rat, 3 and 10 were rapidly metabolized by ester hydrolysis and N-debenzylation, respectively, each to a single polar radiometabolite.

Various analogues as positional isomers have been developed where location of the phenolic hydroxyl group has been varied on the aromatic ring. Between two catechol derivatives, compound 6e with a two methylene linker length exhibited higher affinity and selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors over compound 6f with four methylene linkers (D2/D3 = 50.6 vs 7.51 for 6e and 6f, respectively). In general, the (-)-isomer was more potent than the (+)-isomeric counterpart. Binding results indicated highest selectivity for D3 receptors in compound (-)- 10 ( K i = 0.35 nM; D2/D3 = 71). In the 5-hydroxy series, highest selectivity for D3 receptors was exhibited by compound (-)- 25 ( K i = 0.82 nM; D2/D3 = 31.5). Most potent compounds exhibited binding and functional affinities at the sub-nanomolar level for the D3 receptor. Binding assays were carried out with HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 receptors by using tritiated spiperone as radioligand for competition studies to evaluate inhibition constants ( K i). A functional assay of selected compounds for stimulating GTPgammaS binding was carried out with CHO cells expressing human D2 receptors and AtT-20 cells expressing human D3 receptors. The functional assay results indicated partial to full agonist characteristics of test compounds.

Antisense oligonucleotide studies directed against Na(v)1.8 have shown that this channel contributes to experimental inflammatory and neuropathic pain. We report here the discovery of A-803467, a sodium channel blocker that potently blocks tetrodotoxin-resistant currents (IC(50) = 140 nM) and the generation of spontaneous and electrically evoked action potentials in vitro in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons. In recombinant cell lines, A-803467 potently blocked human Na(v)1.8 (IC(50) = 8 nM) and was >100-fold selective vs. human Na(v)1.2, Na(v)1.3, Na(v)1.5, and Na(v)1.7 (IC(50) values >or=1 microM). A-803467 (20 mg/kg, i.v.) blocked mechanically evoked firing of wide dynamic range neurons in the rat spinal dorsal horn. A-803467 also dose-dependently reduced mechanical allodynia in a variety of rat pain models including: spinal nerve ligation (ED(50) = 47 mg/kg, i.p.), sciatic nerve injury (ED(50) = 85 mg/kg, i.p.), capsaicin-induced secondary mechanical allodynia (ED(50) approximately 100 mg/kg, i.p.), and thermal hyperalgesia after intraplantar complete Freund's adjuvant injection (ED(50) = 41 mg/kg, i.p.). A-803467 was inactive against formalin-induced nociception and acute thermal and postoperative pain.

The D2R-selective antagonist 3-[4-(4-chlorophenyl)-4-hydroxypiperidinyl]methylindole (1, L741,626; K(i)(D2R/D3R) = 11.2:163 nM) has previously provided a lead template for chemical modification.

Further exploration of both N-substituted and aryl ring-substituted analogues resulted in the discovery of several high affinity D2R/D3R ligands with 3-benzofurylmethyl-substituents (e.g., 45, K(i)(D2R/D3R) = 1.7:0.34 nM) that induced high affinity not achieved in similarly N-substituted piperidine analogues and significantly (470-fold) improved D3R binding affinity compared to the parent ligand 1.

As actually the most effective and less side effective antipsychotics are drugs with multiple targets we have designed typical and atypical neuroleptics with an additional histamine H3 pharmacophore. The 4-(3-piperidinopropoxy)phenyl pharmacophore moiety has been linked to amitriptyline, maprotiline, chlorpromazine, chlorprothixene, fluphenazine, and clozapine. Amide, amine and ester elements have been used generally to maintain or slightly shift affinity at dopamine D(2)-like receptors (D2 and D3), to decrease affinity at histamine H(1) receptors, and to obtain H3R ligands with low nanomolar or subnanomolar affinity.

Compounds were subjected to [(3)H]spiperone binding assays, carried out with HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 dopamine receptors, in order to evaluate their inhibition constant (K(i)) at these receptors. Results indicate that N-substitution on the piperazine ring can accommodate various substituted indole rings. The results also show that in order to maintain high affinity and selectivity for the D3 receptor the heterocyclic ring does not need to be connected directly to the piperazine ring as the majority of compounds included here are linked either via an amide or a methylene linker to the heterocyclic moiety. The enantiomers of the most potent racemic compound 10e exhibited differential activity with (-)-10e (K(i); D2=47.5 nM, D3=0.57 nM) displaying higher affinity at both D2 and D3 receptors compared to its enantiomer (+)-10e (K(i); D2=113 nM, D3=3.73 nM). Additionally, compound (-)-10e was more potent and selective for the D3 receptor compared to either 7-OH-DPAT or 5-OH-DPAT. Among the bioisosteric derivatives, the indazole derivative 10g and benzo[b]thiophene derivative 10i exhibited the highest affinity for D2 and D3 receptors.

548676,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to dopamine receptor D3,"Title: Synthesis and pharmacological properties of novel hydrophilic 5-HT4 receptor antagonists._||_Abstract: Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is an important signalling molecule in the human body. The 5-HT(4) serotonin receptor, coupled to the G protein G(s), plays important physiological and pathophysiological roles in the heart, urinary bladder, gastrointestinal tract and the adrenal gland. Both 5-HT(4) antagonists and agonists have been developed in the aim to treat diseases in these organs. 5-HT(4) agonists might have beneficial effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and therefore, 5-HT(4) antagonists might cause CNS side effects. In this study, we have developed new amphoteric 5-HT(4) antagonists. A series of cyclic indole amide derivatives possessing an oxazine ring and a piperidine alkane carboxylic acid side chain and the corresponding prodrug esters were synthesized and their binding to 5-HT(4) receptors and antagonist properties were evaluated. In addition, an indole ester without the oxazine ring and the corresponding indole amide derivatives were also tested. Octanol-water distribution (LogD(Oct7.4)) was tested for some of the synthesized ligands. The main structure-affinity characteristics of the 5-HT(4) compounds tested were that the prodrug esters show higher affinity than their corresponding free acids, indole esters show higher affinity than the corresponding amides and ligands containing the oxazine ring in the indole skeleton show higher affinity than indole derivatives not containing the ring. One representative prodrug ester and its corresponding free acid were tested for binding on a panel of receptors and showed preserved selectivity for the 5-HT(4) receptor. These new molecules may be useful to target peripheral 5-HT(4) receptors.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1640622,20180915,50898777|50898778,124961669|124966791,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21075638,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

624500,Confirmatory,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: SAR in D3 Beta Arrestin Assay,"There is great interest in identifying small molecule ligands for G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) as nearly 50% of all FDA-approved drugs target these important receptor proteins. Unfortunately, many of the ligands that are used as drugs, or as pharmacological tools, are not selective and exhibit problematic or limiting side effects due to inappropriate signaling activities. Amongst the dopamine receptors (DARs), the D2 is arguably one of the most validated drug targets in neurology and psychiatry. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs primarily work via stimulating the D2 DAR, whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. The D2 DAR is also therapeutically targeted in other disorders such as restless legs syndrome, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette's syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. However, most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, either being less efficacious than desired or possessing adverse side effects due to the activation or blockade of inappropriate signaling pathways. A novel approach for attaining greater selectivity of therapeutic agents targeting the D2 DAR is needed to identify and develop ligands that exhibit functionally-selective properties._||_This is an selectivity assay to test the lead compounds against the D3 receptor, using a beta arrestin assay._||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Production Network [MLPCN]_||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_Grant: NS0676421_||_PI Name: David Sibley, National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2702,20120817,133633|16007814|57377246|57383397|57383401|57383403|57383405|57383408|57383414|57383420|57383430|57383431|57383434|57383436,124880521|136882616|136889447|136889448|136889449|136889450|136889451|136889452|136889453|136889454|136889455|136889456|136889458|136889491,1814,NULL,P35462,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,NULL,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL
624502,Other,HTS Assay for Allosteric Antagonists of the Human D2 Dopamine Receptor: SAR in D3 Binding Assay,"Dopamine receptors (DARs) are involved in the etiology and/or therapy of a number of neuropsychiatric and endocrine disorders. For instance, all receptor-based antiparkinsonian drugs work via stimulating the D2 DAR subtype whereas all FDA-approved antipsychotic agents are antagonists of this receptor. Most drugs targeting the D2 DAR are problematic, however, either being less efficacious as desired or possessing limiting side effects, most of which are due to reactivity at other receptors. One approach towards improved receptor specificity is to identify allosteric ligands that bind to less conserved regions of the receptor and therefore have the potential to be much more selective. The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D2 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. There are three different types of allosteric modulators that we are seeking, two of which will stimulate or augment receptor signaling, allosteric agonists and potentiators, while the third, allosteric antagonists, will attenuate receptor signaling. The present primary screening assay measures compound antagonism after an EC80 addition of dopamine by tracking calcium flux in a force-coupled, inducible Hek293 Trex D3 cell line. This selectivity assay measures activity of the leads in the D3 radioligand binding assay._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: NS0676421_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),DOP2704,20120817,57377246,136882616,1814,NULL,P35462,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,NULL,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

The molecule conformational flexibility in the series is restricted by formation of the intramolecular hydrogen bond between 3-sulfo and 2-methylamino groups, which renders high potency and high selectivity to block serotonin-induced responses in HEK-293 cells stably expressing human 5-HT(6)R. In this work, we tested the hypothesis if addition of a positively ionizable group (PI) to the pyrimidine ring of the scaffold members in positions 5, 6, or 7 could further increase their 5HT(6)R blocking potency. We show that the presence of the PI group with small substituents does not substantially affect either potency or selectivity of the ligands while causing substantial changes in their cLogP values. This provides a possibility for designing of the 5HT(6)R ligands with modified ADME characteristics without grossly affecting efficiency of their interaction with the receptor. In respect to the structure-activity relationship (SAR), among other physiochemical parameters, only the molecule size and shape (described by gyration radii) showed a clear tendency for more compact molecules to be more potent antagonists of this receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1925311,20180920,56655504,136939345,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22029285,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

These ligands were labeled with the short-lived positron emitter fluorine-18 and analyzed for their potential application for imaging studies by positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro autoradiography was used to determine their nonspecific binding behavior as a result of their structural and thus physicochemical properties. The biodistribution, in vivo stability, and brain uptake of the most promising D4 radioligand candidate were determined. This proved to be 1-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b][1,4]dioxin-6-yl)-4-((6-fluoropyridin-3-yl)methyl)piperazine ([18F]3d), which revealed an excellent binding pattern with a high selectivity and limited nonspecific binding in vitro. This analogue also exhibited a high stability and an extremely high brain uptake in vivo with specific binding in hippocampus, cortex, colliculus, and cerebellum as determined by ex vivo autoradiography.

Only a few chemical entities targeting nAChRs are currently undergoing clinical trials, and even fewer have reached the marketplace. In our efforts to discover novel and truly selective nAChR ligands, we designed and synthesized a series of chiral cyclopropane-containing α4β2-specific ligands that display low nanomolar binding affinities and excellent subtype selectivity while acting as partial agonists at α4β2-nAChRs. Their favorable antidepressant-like properties were demonstrated in the classical mouse forced swim test. Preliminary ADMET studies and broad screening toward other common neurotransmitter receptors were also carried out to further evaluate their safety profile and eliminate their potential off-target activity. These highly potent cyclopropane ligands possess superior subtype selectivity compared to other α4β2-nAChR agonists reported to date, including the marketed drug varenicline, and therefore may fully satisfy the crucial prerequisite for avoiding adverse side effects. These novel chemical entities could potentially be advanced to the clinic as new drug candidates for treating depression.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2026365,20200626,45254040|56951368|56951495,160678244|160688954|160705128,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22171543,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The most significant pathway for cellular response to hypoxia is the hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) pathway. HIFs are transcription factors responsible for the activation of genes which encode proteins that mediate adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. A high-throughput cell-based HIF-mediated gene reporter screen was carried out using the NIH's Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository to identify activators of the HIF pathway.

One of the ether analogues (13), with superior potency and in vitro pharmacokinetic properties, was tested in vivo for its pharmacokinetic profile, brain penetration, and efficacy in an ALS mouse model. The analogue showed sustained blood and brain levels in vivo and significant activity in the mouse model of ALS, thus validating the new aryloxanyl pyrazolone scaffold as an important novel therapeutic lead for the treatment of this neurodegenerative disorder.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167234,20180923,45102767,136923905,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22191331,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167999,20180923,1346|851833|9859120|10354670|10454026|10456166|12461787|15356306|19871273|44203057|53248299|53248300|58358826,103169108|103196922|103356575|103402070|163313965|163324236|163327704|163327705|163327706|163329505|163334553|163334704|163334705,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,NULL,P35462,9606,45,,NULL

Current therapeutic treatment for obesity is mostly focused on preventive measures involving dietary control and physical exercises in combination with anti-obesity medications. However, most of these anti-obesity medications have little or no effect on weight loss, and some cases have demonstrated fatal side effects. Due to the urgent need for highly potent and selective anti-obesity agents, the serotonin receptors (5-HTR) have been the focus of much interest as a novel therapeutic target. In this report, we have developed pyrimidoazepine analogs targeting the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and evaluated their biological activity in vitro and in vivo as novel anti-obesity agents. We were able to identify 6p as the most potent 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C ligand in vitro (IC50 = 3 nM and 2.3 nM, respectively), and this compound also demonstrated the greatest potency in vivo. In an acute obesity model, mice treated with 6p showed significant decrease in body weight gain and food intake over approximately 77-94% compared to a control group.

D1 receptors were sensitive to the introduction of the 4-OH-benzyl function resulting in an increased affinity. The small hydrophilic group (hydroxymethyl) highly reduced the agonist affinity and potency thereby increasing subtype selectivity. This strategy for selective modulation of affinities and potencies of 1-substituted apomorphines gives essential hints for future design of subtype selective dopaminergic ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2399861,20200629,681|6005|71722292|71722294|71722296|71722298|71722300|71722433,103167211|103167911|174486714|174491753|174502026|174512358|174517399|242611293,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23727194,0,NULL,P35462,9606,45,,NULL

This implies a considerable diversity in the mechanisms of action produced by structural changes to the phenothiazine scaffold. For example, chlorpromazine treatment of psychosis is related to its interaction with dopaminergic receptors. On the other hand, antagonistic action of such drugs on cholinergic receptor systems would be counter-productive for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. In a search for phenothiazines that are inhibitors of cholinesterases, especially butyrylcholinesterase, with potential to treat Alzheimer's disease, we wished to ascertain that such molecules could be devoid of neurotransmitter receptor interactions. To that end, a number of our synthetic N-10-carbonyl phenothiazine derivatives, with cholinesterase inhibitory activity, were tested for interaction with a variety of neurotransmitter receptor systems. We demonstrate that phenothiazines can be prepared without significant neurotransmitter receptor interactions while retaining high potency as cholinesterase ligands for treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2404440,20180927,24841480|44435193|44568347,103539749|103603442|103603443,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23707254,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

The major drawback of C-11 tracers is the lack of cyclotron facility in many health care centers thereby limiting widespread clinical or research use. We identified the fluoroethyl derivative, 2-(4-(4-(2-(2-fluoroethoxy)phenyl)piperazin-1-yl)butyl)-4-methyl-1,2,4-triazine-3,5(2H,4H)dione (FECUMI-101) (Ki=0.1nM; Emax=77%; EC50=0.65nM) as a partial agonist 5-HT1AR ligand of the parent ligand CUMI-101. FECUMI-101 is radiolabeled with F-18 by O-fluoroethylation of the corresponding desmethyl analogue (1) with [(18)F]fluoroethyltosylate in DMSO in the presence of 1.6equiv of K2CO3 in 45±5% yield (EOS). PET shows [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binds specifically to 5-HT1AR enriched brain regions of baboon. The specificity of [(18)F]FECUMI-101 binding to 5-HT1AR was confirmed by challenge studies with the known 5-HT1AR ligand WAY100635.

For many decades, natural product research has been a very active field of research in Mexico, and there also are some ongoing ethnopharmacological research efforts. This review provides an overview and critical appraisal on some key developments in these fields and examples of medicinal plants used by indigenous communities that have become of great local importance in Mexican popular medicine. In this review, the focus is on plants with effects on the CNS, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory processes, and gastrointestinal disorders. While some of the major food plants consumed worldwide originate from southern North America, only very few medicinal plants have become of major global importance. Opuntia species are now used increasingly to manage diabetes and metabolic syndrome and represent an example of a novel medicinal product/supplement. Undoubtedly, narcotic and mind-altering drugs both have received the widest scientific interest and have attracted considerable popular attention. The history of use of the indigenous Mexican Materia Medica in the context of research on local and popular resources specifically with regard to the diverse challenges in the context of studying the world's biodiversity and the development of comparative and semiquantitative ethnobotanical research methods is discussed herein. Natural product and ethnopharmacological research in Mexico seems to have been influenced by the political and societal developments originating from the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and subsequent conventions, which have not yet had the desired effect of giving value to these local resources, as they might deserve. Their equitable and sustainable implementation remains a challenge.

Compound optimization led to the identification of potent mGlu2/3 selective PAMs with no in vitro activity at mGlu1,4-8 or 45 other CNS receptors. In vitro pharmacological characterization of representative compound 44 indicated agonist-PAM activity toward mGlu2 and PAM activity at mGlu3. The most potent mGlu2/3 PAMs were characterized in assays predictive of ADME/T and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, allowing the discovery of systemically active mGlu2/3 PAMs. On the basis of its overall profile, compound 74 was selected for behavioral studies and was shown to dose-dependently decrease cocaine self-administration in rats after intraperitoneal administration.

In vitro studies confirmed their antagonism of 5-HT(7/2A) and D2 receptors and weak interactions with key antitargets (M1R and hERG) associated with side effects. Marked 5-HT6 receptor affinities were also observed, notably for 6-fluoro-3-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2-benzoxazole derivatives connected by a 3-4 unit alkyl linker with mono- or bicyclic, lipophilic arylsulfonamide moieties. N-[4-[4-(6-Fluoro-1,2-benzoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl]butyl]benzothiophene-2-sulfonamide (72) was characterized in vitro on 14 targets and antitargets. It displayed dual blockade of 5-HT6 and D2 receptors and negligible interactions at hERG and M1 receptors.

Heterocyclic dopamine surrogates comprising a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine moiety were synthesized and investigated for their binding properties when low- to subnanomolar K(i) values were determined for D(2L), D(2S), and D3 receptors. Measurement of [(35)S]GTPγS incorporation at D(2S) coexpressed with G-protein subunits indicated significant bias for promotion of Gα(o1) over Gα(i2) coupling for several test compounds. Functionally selective D(2S) activation was most striking for the carbaldoxime 8b (Gα(o1), pEC50 = 8.87, E(max) = 65%; Gα(i2), pEC50 = 6.63, E(max) = 27%). In contrast, the investigated 1,4-disubstituted aromatic piperazines (1,4-DAPs) behaved as antagonists for β-arrestin-2 recruitment, implying significant ligand bias for G-protein activation over β-arrestin-2 recruitment at D(2S) receptors.

Exploitation of the original structure-activity relationships resulted in the identification of safe and effective antipsychotics devoid of extrapyramidal symptoms liability, sedation, and catalepsy. The potential atypical antipsychotic 5bb was selected for further pharmacological investigation. The distribution of c-fos positive cells in the ventral striatum confirmed the atypical antipsychotic profile of 5bb in agreement with behavioral rodent studies. 5bb administered orally demonstrated a biphasic effect on the MK801-induced hyperactivity at dose levels not able to induce sedation, catalepsy, or learning impairment in passive avoidance. In microdialysis studies, 5bb increased the dopamine efflux in the medial prefrontal cortex. Thus, 5bb represents a valuable lead for the development of atypical antipsychotics endowed with a unique pharmacological profile for addressing negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3383600,20181005,24769156,312372275,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25343529,0,NULL,P35462,9606,198,,NULL

This study tested the hypothesis that further modifications of the tropane analog to produce compounds with less potent binding to the D2 receptor than haloperidol, would produce less catalepsy. These tests have now revealed that while haloperidol produced maximum catalepsy, these compounds produced moderate to low levels of catalepsy. Compound 9, with the least binding affinity to the D2R, produced the least catalepsy and highest Minimum Adverse Effective Dose (MAED) of the analogs tested regardless of their affinities at other receptors including the 5-HT1AR. These observations support the hypothesis that moderation of the D2 binding of the tropane analogs could reduce catalepsy potential in rats and consequently EPS in man.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3366157,20181006,3559|13091268|13091356|13091359|21527771|21533446|57403525|76518514|118709750|118709751|135398745,103167216|103195217|103488767|136922797|136932519|136945472|312351717|312351718|312351719|312351720|312351721,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25070422,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

However, the majority of the nNOS inhibitors developed are arginine mimetics and, therefore, suffer from poor bioavailability. We designed a novel strategy to combine a more pharmacokinetically favorable 2-imidazolylpyrimidine head with promising structural components from previous inhibitors. In conjunction with extensive structure-activity studies, several highly potent and selective inhibitors of nNOS were discovered. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that these type II inhibitors utilize the same hydrophobic pocket to gain strong inhibitory potency (13), as well as high isoform selectivity. Interestingly, select compounds from this series (9) showed good permeability and low efflux in a Caco-2 assay, suggesting potential oral bioavailability, and exhibited minimal off-target binding to 50 central nervous system receptors. Furthermore, even with heme-coordinating groups in the molecule, modifying other pharmacophoric fragments minimized undesirable inhibition of cytochrome P450s from human liver microsomes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3412940,20181006,118730369,312384124,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25489882,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

Diverse pharmacophore moieties yielded 3 series of hybrids with varying in vitro properties at 5-HT6R and D2R, and at M1 receptor and hERG channel antitargets. 4-(piperazin-1-yl)-1H-indole derivatives showed highest antagonist potency at 5-HT6R, with 7-butoxy-3,4-dihydroquinolin-2(1H)-one and 2-propoxybenzamide derivatives having promising D2R partial agonism. 2-(3-(4-(1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indol-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propoxy)benzamide (47) exhibited nanomolar affinity at both 5-HT6R and D2R and was evaluated in rat models. It displayed potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like activity in the Porsolt and Vogel tests, respectively, more pronounced than that of a reference selective 5-HT6R antagonist or D2R partial agonist. In addition, 47 also showed antidepressant-like activity (Porsolt's test) and anxiolytic-like activity (open field test) in aged (>18-month old) rats. In operant conditioning tests, 47 enhanced responding for sweet reward in the saccharin self-administration test, consistent with anti-anhedonic properties. Further, 47 facilitated extinction of non-reinforced responding for sweet reward, suggesting potential procognitive activity.

We therefore decided to explore NK3R antagonists as therapeutics for sex-hormone disorders that can potentially benefit from lowering GnRH pulsatility with consequent diminished levels of plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and correspondingly attenuated levels of circulating androgens and estrogens. The discovery and lead optimization of a novel N-acyl-triazolopiperazine NK3R antagonist chemotype achieved through bioisosteric lead change from the high-throughput screening (HTS) hit is described. A concomitant improvement in the antagonist bioactivity and ligand lipophilic efficiency (LLE) parameter were the principal guidelines in the lead optimization efforts. Examples of advanced lead analogues to demonstrate the amenability of this chemotype to achieving a suitable pharmacokinetic (PK) profile are provided as well as pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) correlations to analyze the trends observed for LH inhibition in castrated rats and monkeys that served as preliminary in vivo efficacy models.,43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3425053,20181006,219077,103399782,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25738882,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

In an effort to learn to design functionally selective molecular tools for the highly therapeutically relevant dopamine D2 receptor, we synthesized a collection of agonists based on structurally distinct head groups derived from canonical or atypical dopaminergic pharmacophores. The test compounds feature a long lipophilic appendage that was shown to mediate biased signaling. By employing functional assays and molecular dynamics simulations, we could show that atypical dopamine surrogates of type 1 and 2 promote biased signaling, while ligands built from classical dopaminergic head groups (type 3 and 4) typically elicit more balanced signaling profiles. Besides this, we found a strong influence of the stereochemistry of type 4 aminotetraline-derived agonists on functional selectivity at D2 receptors.

The commercially available alkaloid boldine (2) was used as the starting material for synthesis of various C-9 alkoxy analogues of N-methyllaurotetanine in order to gauge the effect of C-9 alkylation on affinity and selectivity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT7 receptors. Mitsunobu reactions were implemented in the alkylation steps leading to the analogues. Modest improvement in 5-HT1A affinity was observed upon alkylation for most analogues. Thus, the C-9 hydroxy group of 1 is not critical for affinity to the 5-HT1A receptor.

A common molecular template used in the development of D3R-selective antagonists and partial agonists incorporates a butylamide linker between two pharmacophores, a phenylpiperazine moiety and an extended aryl ring system. The series of compounds described herein incorporates a change to that chemical template, replacing the amide functional group in the linker chain with a 1,2,3-triazole group. Although the amide linker in the 4-phenylpiperazine class of D3R ligands has been previously deemed critical for high D3R affinity and selectivity, the 1,2,3-triazole moiety serves as a suitable bioisosteric replacement and maintains desired D3R-binding functionality of the compounds. Additionally, using mouse liver microsomes to evaluate CYP450-mediated phase I metabolism, we determined that novel 1,2,3-triazole-containing compounds modestly improves metabolic stability compared to amide-containing analogues.

A partial agonist molecule (-)-34 (EC50 (GTPγS); D2 = 21.6 (Emax = 27%) and D3 = 10.9 nM) was also identified. In a Parkinson's disease (PD) animal model, (-)-21a was highly efficacious in reversing hypolocomotion in reserpinized rats with a long duration of action, indicating its potential as an anti-PD drug. Compound (-)-34 was also able to elevate locomotor activity in the above PD animal model significantly, implying its potential application in PD therapy. Furthermore, (-)-21a was shown to be neuroprotective in protecting neuronal PC12 from toxicity of 6-OHDA. This report, therefore, underpins the notion that a multifunctional drug like (-)-21a might have the potential not only to ameliorate motor dysfunction in PD patients but also to modify disease progression by protecting DA neurons from progressive degeneration.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3745237,20200623,5311189|127039745|127039746|127042371|127042372,103166191|336889202|336889203|336892682|336892683,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26555041,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

Though widely prescribed for pain and inflammation, these agents have limited utility in chronic diseases due to serious mechanism-based adverse events such as gastrointestinal damage. Concomitant blockade of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enhances the therapeutic effects of the NSAIDs while attenuating their propensity to cause gastrointestinal injury. This favorable interaction is attributed to the accumulation of protective FAAH substrates, such as the endocannabinoid anandamide, and suggests that agents simultaneously targeting COX and FAAH might provide an innovative strategy to combat pain and inflammation with reduced side effects. Here, we describe the rational design and structure-active relationship (SAR) properties of the first class of potent multitarget FAAH-COX inhibitors. A focused SAR exploration around the prototype 10r (ARN2508) led to the identification of achiral (18b) as well as racemic (29a-c and 29e) analogs. Absolute configurational assignment and pharmacological evaluation of single enantiomers of 10r are also presented.

In animal behavioral models, 9j inhibited the locomotor-stimulating effects of phencyclidine, blocked conditioned avoidance response, and improved the cognitive deficit in the novel object recognition tests in rats. 9j exhibited a low potential for catalepsy, consistent with results with risperidone. In addition, favorable brain penetration of 9j in rats was detected. These studies have demonstrated that 9j is a potential atypical antipsychotic candidate.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3872779,20180907,86342156,374322860,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27487565,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

Such compounds will be valuable to evaluate as anti-cocaine therapeutics. Towards that eventual goal, we engaged an SAR study in which a series of C9 alkoxy analogues of the D1/D2/D3 ligand (-)-stepholidine that possessed or lacked a C12 bromo functionality, were synthesized and evaluated for affinity at dopamine D1, D2 and D3 receptors. We found that the analogues are generally selective for the D1 receptor. Small n-alkoxy substituents (up to 4 carbons in length) were generally well tolerated for high D1 affinity but such groups reduced D3 affinity. In the case of C12 brominated analogues, C9 alkoxylation also had little effect on D1 affinity for the smaller alkoxy groups, but reduced D2 and D3 affinities significantly. C12 bromination tends to increase D1 receptor selectivity. A number of compounds were identified that retain affinity for D1 and D3 receptors but lack D2 receptor affinity. Among them, compound 22a was found to be a selective D1/D3 dual antagonist (Ki = 5.3 and 106 nM at D1 and D3 receptors). Docking studies performed on the analogues at the D3 receptor revealed a number of interactions that are important for affinity including a critical N - Asp110 salt bridge motif, H-bonds to Ser192 and Cys181 and hydrophobic interactions between the aryl rings and Phe106 and Phe345.

The compounds generally displayed strong affinity for D3R with very good D3R selectivity. Docking studies at D2R and D3R crystal structures revealed that the molecules are oriented such that their arylamine units are positioned in the orthosteric binding pocket of D3R, with the arylamide 'tail' units residing in the secondary binding pocket. Hydrogen bonding between Ser 182 and Tyr 365 at D3R stabilize extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which in turn contributes to ligand binding by interacting with the 'tail' units of the ligands in the secondary binding pocket. Similar interactions between ECL2 and the 'tail' units were absent at D2R due to different positioning of the D2R loop region. The presence of multiple H-bonds with the phenol moiety of the headgroup of 7 and Ser192 accounts for its stronger D3R affinity as compared to the 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-containing analogue 8.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4269474,20200619,145988474|145989012|145993700|145993990,404709609|404710458|404717809|404718304,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30344905,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

The ability to bind two distinct receptor binding sites simultaneously can allow the selective activation of specific G-protein dependent or β-arrestin-mediated cascade pathways. Herein, we developed an extended SAR study using sumanirole (1) as the primary pharmacophore.

Most nNOS inhibitors mimic l-arginine and have poor bioavailability. 2-Aminoquinolines showed promise as bioavailable nNOS inhibitors but suffered from low human nNOS inhibition, low selectivity versus human eNOS, and significant binding to other CNS targets. We aimed to improve human nNOS potency and selectivity and reduce off-target binding by (a) truncating the original scaffold or (b) introducing a hydrophilic group to interrupt the lipophilic, promiscuous pharmacophore and promote interaction with human nNOS-specific His342. We synthesized both truncated and polar 2-aminoquinoline derivatives and assayed them against recombinant NOS enzymes. Although aniline and pyridine derivatives interact with His342, benzonitriles conferred the best rat and human nNOS inhibition. Both introduction of a hydrophobic substituent next to the cyano group and aminoquinoline methylation considerably improved isoform selectivity. Most importantly, these modifications preserved Caco-2 permeability and reduced off-target CNS binding.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4041186,20200621,121250406,381873503,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,28776992,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

Analogues 5-10 were rationally designed and prepared to evaluate whether electronic and/or lipophilic properties of substituents in the ortho position of its phenoxy moiety exert any favorable effects on the affinity/activity at 5-HT1A receptor and improve selectivity over α1-ARs. To rationalize the experimental observations and derive information about receptor-ligand interactions of the reported ligands, docking studies, using 5-HT1A and α1d-AR models generated by homology techniques, and a retrospective computational study were performed. The results highlighted that proper substituents in position 2 of the phenoxy moiety of 3 selectively address the ligands toward 5-HT1A receptor with respect to α1-ARs and D2-like receptor subtypes. Methoxymethylenoxy derivative 9 showed the best 5-HT1A selectivity profile and the highest potency at 5-HT1A receptor, behaving as a partial agonist.

A decade of medicinal chemistry efforts has led to several promising ligands, although the chemical structures described so far possesses a singular limited diversity. We report here the discovery of novel structures, belonging to completely different scaffolds. The virtual screening was planed as a two-steps process. First, using a 'scout screening' methodology, we have experimentally probed the H4R ligand binding site using a small size chemical library with very diverse structures, and identified a hit that further assist us in refining a raw 3D homology model. Second, the refined 3D model was used to conduct a widened virtual screening. This two-steps strategy proved to be very successful, both in terms of structural diversity and hit rate (23%).

In contrast to antagonists, partial agonists may cause fewer side effects since they maintain some dopaminergic tone and may be less disruptive to normal neuronal functions. Here, we report three sets of 4-phenylpiperazine stereoisomers that differ considerably in efficacy: the (R)-enantiomers are antagonists/weak partial agonists, whereas the (S)-enantiomers are much more efficacious. To investigate the structural basis of partial agonism, we performed comparative microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations starting from the inactive state of D3R in complex with these enantiomers. Analysis of the simulation results reveals common structural rearrangements near the ligand binding site induced by the bound (S)-enantiomers, but not by the (R)-enantiomers, that are features of partially activated receptor conformations.

This ligand comprises a thieno[2,3- d]pyrimidine scaffold that does not feature in known dopaminergic ligands. Herein, we provide pharmacological validation of an allosteric mode of action for 1, revealing that it is a NAM of dopamine efficacy and identify the structural determinants of this allostery.

Previous work has exemplified the use of bitopic ligands as a powerful strategy in achieving subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists alike. Inspired by the potential for chemical modification of the D3 preferential agonists (+)-PD128,907 (1) and PF592,379 (2), we synthesized bitopic structures to further improve their D3R selectivity. We found that the (2S,5S) conformation of scaffold 2 resulted in a privileged architecture with increased affinity and selectivity for the D3R. In addition, a cyclopropyl moiety incorporated into the linker and full resolution of the chiral centers resulted in lead compound 53 and eutomer 53a that demonstrate significantly higher D3R binding selectivities than the reference compounds.

Molecular docking screens against crystal structures of the A<sub>2A</sub> adenosine and the D<sub>4</sub> dopamine receptors were carried out, and 53 top-ranked molecules were evaluated experimentally. Two ligands of each receptor were discovered, and the most potent had sub-micromolar affinities.

Three series of racemic aporphines were investigated: 1,2,10-trisubstituted, C10 N-monosubstituted and compounds containing a C10 benzofused aminothiazole moiety. The 1,2,10-trisubstituted series of compounds as a group displayed modest selectivity for 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R and also had moderate 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R affinity. Compounds from the C10 N-monosubstituted series generally lacked affinity for 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R and 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R and showed strong affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> or 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R. Compounds in this series that contained an N6-methyl group were up to 27-fold selective for 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R over 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R, whereas compounds with an N6-propyl substituent showed a reversal in this selectivity. The C10 benzofused aminothiazole analogues showed a similar binding profile as the C10 N-monosubstituted series i.e. strong affinity for 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R or 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R, with selectivity between the two receptors being similarly influenced by N6-methyl or N6-propyl substituents. Compounds 29 and 34a exhibit high 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R affinity, excellent selectivity versus dopamine receptors and function as antagonists in 5-HT<sub>7A</sub>R cAMP-based assays.

Certain of the 2-aminoindan derivatives displayed pharmacologic properties consistent with their being dopaminergic agonists. The beta-phenethylamine derivative did not show any significant dopamine-like activity. The 7-hydroxy-8-methyloctahydrobenzo[f]quinoline derivative 4a was a moderately potent, short-acting DA2 receptor antagonist. All of the carboxylic acid derivatives were inert. Of the ortho hydroxy/methyl derivatives, only the 5-hydroxy-6-methyl-2-aminotetralin derivative displayed pharmacological properties consistent with its being a dopaminergic prodrug.

Using the two complementary design strategies based on two similarity concepts described in the previous paper, we have obtained analogues with IC(50) values ranging between 0.9 nM and a few micromolar on the mu receptor and displaying qualitatively different profiles.

In receptor binding assays, the 2-TfO analogues (18a, GMC2-83; 24, GMC3-06; and previously reported GMC1-169, 9a) of the dibenzazepines have profiles comparable to that of clozapine, acting on a variety of CNS receptors except they lack M1 receptor affinity. Introduction of 2-TfO to clozapine leads to compound 9e (GMC61-39) which has a similar binding profile as that of clozapine including having M1 receptor affinity. Interestingly, the MsO analogues, as well as the 8-TfO analogues, have no or weak dopaminergic and serotonergic affinities, but all 8-sulfonyloxy analogues do have M1 affinities. In behavioral studies performed to indicate the potential antipsychotic efficacy and the propensity to induce EPS, 2-TfO analogues blocked effectively the apomorphine-induced climbing in mice in a dose-dependent manner with ED50 values (mg/kg) of 2.1 sc for 9a, 1.3 po for 18a, 2.6 sc for 24, and 8.2 sc for 9e. On the other hand, they showed a clear dose separation with regard to their ED50 values (mg/kg) for indicating catalepsy in rats (>44 sc for 9a, 28 po for 18a, 30 sc for 24, and >50 sc for 9e, respectively), thus implicating a more favorable therapeutic ratio (K/A, ED50 climbing/ED50 catalepsy) in comparison with typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and isoclozapine. Furthermore, compound 18a was also demonstrated to be an orally potent DA antagonist with an ED50 value of 0.7 mg/kg po in the ex vivo L-DOPA accumulation model.

Optimization studies were carried out on 8 with the aim of achieving 1000-fold selectivity for hD(4) over all other receptors while retaining the good pharmacokinetic properties of the lead. After initial preparation of 8 as a minor component in a low-yielding reaction, a novel and regioselective 'four-step/one-pot' procedure was developed which proved to be applicable to rapid investigation of the SAR of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one ring. Various changes to substituents attached to the 3-, 4-, or 5-position of the 1, 3-dihydroimidazol-2-one core of 8 did not significantly improve selectivity for hD(4) over hD(2) and hD(3). Greater selectivity (>1000-fold) was ultimately achieved by meta substitution of the benzyl group of 8 with various substituents. Compounds 28, 31, and 32 all possess the required selectivity for hD(4) over the other dopamine subtypes, but only 32 has >1000-fold selectivity over all the key counterscreens we tested against.

Additionally, it was discovered that a group such as 3-(3-methoxybenzyl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl in the 2-position of the indole ring (43) can replace the arylsulfonyl substituent in the 1-position with no loss of affinity. This suggested that the binding conformation of the aminoethyl side chain at this receptor was toward the 4-position of the indole ring and was supported by the fact that the 4-(aminoethyl)indoles (45) also displayed high affinity, as did the conformationally rigid 1,3,4,5-tetrahydrobenz[c,d]indole (49). Molecular modeling showed that 19, 43, and 45 all had low-energy conformers that overlaid well onto 49. Both 19 and 49 had good selectivity over other serotonin receptors tested, with 49 also showing excellent selectivity over all dopamine receptors. In a functional adenylate cyclase stimulation assay, 19 and 49 had no agonist activity, whereas 45 behaved as a partial agonist.

The lead agent 2-(4-pyridin-2-ylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-1H-benzimidazole (1, ABT-724) was discovered by optimization of a series of benzimidazole arylpiperazines. This highly selective D4 agonist was found to be very potent and efficacious in vivo, eliciting penile erections in rats at a dose of 0.03 micromol/kg, with a positive response rate of 77% erectile incidence. Even at high doses, it was devoid of side effects in animal models of central nervous system behaviors, emesis, or nausea.

Introduction of a hydroxy group to increase the flexibility afforded B which served as the screening model and resulted in the identification of the second-generation lead 1. Using the Topliss approach, a number of potent and selective alpha(1a)-AR antagonists were discovered. In all cases, binding affinity and selectivity at the alpha(1a)-AR of S-hydroxy enantiomers were higher than those of the R-hydroxy enantiomers. As compared to the des-hydroxy analogues, the S-hydroxy enantiomers had slightly lower binding affinity at alpha(1a)-AR but gained more than 2-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1b)-AR, and 2- to 6-fold selectivity for alpha(1a)-AR over alpha(1d)-AR. They also had less cross activities against a panel of 25-35 peripheral and CNS receptors. The S-hydroxy enantiomers 23 and 24 (K(i) = 0.29 nM, 0.33 nM; alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) >5690, >6060; alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 186, 158, respectively) were slightly less potent but much more selective at alpha(1a)-AR than tamsulosin (K(i) = 0.13 nM, alpha(1b)/alpha(1a) = 14.8, alpha(1d)/alpha(1a) = 1.4). In the functional assay, the S-hydroxy enantiomers 20, 23, and 24 were less potent than tamsulosin in inhibiting contractions of rat prostate tissue but more selective in the inhibition of tissue contractions of rat prostate versus rat aorta.

65437,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]7-OH-DPAT from human Dopamine receptor D3,"Title: Design, synthesis, and evaluation of metabolism-based analogues of haloperidol incapable of forming MPP+-like species._||_Abstract: The long-term, irreversible, Parkinsonism-like side effects of haloperidol have been speculated to involve several mechanisms. More recently, it has been speculated that the metabolic transformation to MPP+-like species may contribute to the Parkinsonism-like side effects. Because BCPP+ and its reduced analogue have been shown to possess the potential to destroy dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatum, we have designed new analogues of haloperidol lacking the structural features necessary to form neurotoxic quaternary species but retaining their dopamine-binding capacity. The most potent agent at the D2 receptor, the homopiperidine analogue 11, was found to be equipotent to haloperidol. It was also of interest to identify analogues with DA binding profiles similar to that of clozapine at the dopamine receptor subtypes. Evaluation of the proposed agents shows that the ratio of D2 to D4 (2) binding of clozapine was mimicked by 7 [K(i)(D2) = 33, K(i)(D3) = 200, K(i)(D4) = 11 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 3] and 9 [K(i)(D2) = 44, K(i)(D3) = 170, K(i)(D4) = 24 nM; K(i)(D2)/K(i)(D4) = 2]. A preliminary in-vivo testing of compound 7 shows that its behavioral profile is similar to that of clozapine. This profile suggests that there is a need for further evaluation of these two synthetic agents and their enantiomers for efficacy and lack of catalepsy in animal models.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL671515,20210802,3559|9906978|9975463|11199716|11200115|11257780|11303835|11325428|11338272|11382826|11428871|11474752|135398737,103165765|103167216|103391817|103391818|103391819|103392132|103392133|103392134|103392135|103392137|103392158|103392256|103392257,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,14736232,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

They have been evaluated pharmacologically to explore the importance of these substituents for the interaction with central dopamine (DA) receptors. On the basis of biochemical and behavioral data in rats, several of these compounds are characterized as centrally acting DA autoreceptor antagonists. (S)-Phenylpiperidines having an aromatic substituent with a high group dipole moment in the 3-position, i.e., meta with respect to the piperidine ring, and being N-substituted with a propyl group were found to be highly active in vivo on the synthesis and turnover of dopamine. However, they do not induce strong hypoactivity or catalepsy. Interestingly, the most active compounds in vivo were found to display only low affinity for DA D2 and D3 receptors in vitro. In addition, 7-triflate-substituted octahydrobenzo[f]quinolines and 6-triflate-substituted hexahydro-1H-benz[e]indoles have been prepared and pharmacologically evaluated.

In binding studies, the new derivatives were tested against a panel of dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline receptor subtypes. Focusing mainly on dopamine D(3) receptors, SAR studies brought to light a number of structural features required for high receptor affinity and selectivity. Several heteroaromatic systems were explored for their dopamine receptor affinities, and combinations of synthesis, biology, and molecular modeling, were used to identify novel structural leads for the development of potent and selective D(3) receptor ligands. Introduction of an indole ring linked to a dichlorophenylpiperazine system provided two of the most potent and selective ligands known to date (D(3) receptor affinity in the picomolar range). The intrinsic pharmacological properties of a subset of potent D(3) receptor ligands were also assessed in [(35)S]-GTPgammaS binding assays. Evidence from animal studies, in particular, has highlighted the dopaminergic system's role in how environmental stimuli induce drug-seeking behavior. We therefore tested two novel D(3) receptor partial agonists and a potent D(3)-selective antagonist in vivo for their effect in the cocaine-seeking behavior induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli after a long period of abstinence, and without any further cocaine. Compound 5 g, a nonselective partial D(3) receptor agonist with a pharmacological profile similar to 3, and 5p, a potent and selective D(3) antagonist, reduced the number of active lever presses induced by reintroduction of cocaine-associated stimuli. However, 5q, a highly potent and selective D(3) partial agonist, did not have any effect on cocaine-seeking behavior. Although brain uptake studies are needed to establish whether the compounds achieve brain concentrations comparable to those active in vitro on the D(3) receptor, our experiments suggest that antagonism at D(2) receptors might significantly contribute to the reduction of cocaine craving by partial D(3) agonists.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL670711,20181017,5202,103165719,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12930145,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

A cross-species study on the metabolism of (R)-3 in vitro has shown large variations in the extent of metabolism from species to species.

Consequently, the 8-OTf-substituted compound R-(+)-6 was found to be a potent and selective 5-HT1A (5-hydroxytryptamine) receptor agonist inducing a full-blown 5-HT syndrome in normal rats, while the corresponding 5-OTf-substituted compound S-(-)-12 was found to be a preferential dopamine (DA) autoreceptor agonist. A partial 5-HT syndrome was also observed for S-(-)-12, while the corresponding R-(+)-12 was found to be inactive at the DA and 5-HT receptors both in vitro and in vivo.

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM).

238749,Confirmatory,Binding affinity for human dopamine D3 receptor,"Title: Novel heterocyclic trans olefin analogues of N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl]butyl}arylcarboxamides as selective probes with high affinity for the dopamine D3 receptor._||_Abstract: Dopamine D3 receptor subtypes have been hypothesized to play a pivotal role in modulating the reinforcing and drug-seeking effects induced by cocaine. However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1. In summary, chemical modification of 1 has resulted in compounds with high affinity and selectivity for D3 receptors.

However, definitive pharmacological investigations have been hampered by the lack of highly D3 receptor selective compounds that can be used in vivo. To address this problem, the potent and D3-receptor-selective antagonist NGB 2904 (1, 9H-fluorene-2-carboxylic acid {4-[(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-butyl}-amide, Ki (hD3) = 2.0 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 112 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 56) was chosen as a lead structure for chemical modification in an attempt to reduce its high lipophilicity (c log D = 6.94) while optimizing D3 receptor binding affinity and D2/D3 selectivity. A series of >30 novel analogues were synthesized, and their binding affinities were evaluated in competition binding assays in HEK 293 cells transfected with either D2(L), D3, or D4 human dopamine receptors using the high affinity, selective D2-like receptor antagonist (125)I-IABN. Structural diversity in the aryl amide end of the molecule was found to have a major influence on (sub)nanomolar D3 receptor affinity and D2/D3 selectivity, which was optimized using a more rigid trans-butenyl linker between the aryl amide and the piperazine. Several analogues demonstrated superior D3 receptor binding affinities and selectivities as compared to the parent ligand. Compound 29 (N-{4-[4-(2,3-dichlorophenyl)-piperazin-1-yl]-trans-but-2-enyl}-4-pyridine-2-yl-benzamide) displayed the most promising pharmacological profile (Ki (hD3) = 0.7 nM, Ki (hD2L) = 93.3 nM, D2/D3 selectivity ratio of 133). In addition, this ligand inhibited quinpirole stimulation of mitogenesis at human dopamine D3 receptors transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, with an EC50 value of 3.0 nM. Compound 29 was a nearly 5 times more potent antagonist at the D3 receptor than 1 (EC50 = 14.4 nM). Moreover, a decrease in c log D value of approximately 2 orders of magnitude was determined for this novel D3-receptor-preferring ligand, compared to 1. In summary, chemical modification of 1 has resulted in compounds with high affinity and selectivity for D3 receptors. The most promising candidate, compound 29, is currently being evaluated in animal models of cocaine abuse and will provide an important tool with which to elucidate the role of D3 receptors in drug reinforcement in vivo.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL838014,20181018,9891901|9980998|10001256|10276451|11223885|11224283|11307083|11316847|11351639|11375068|11408148|11477180,103252237|103252954|103265882|103381942|103440227|103440257|103440298|103440349|103440417|103463820|103463979|103464153,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,15689168,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

The initially reported tryptamine analogues displayed either poor solution stability, potent central nervous system activity, or both of these undesirable characteristics and were unacceptable for clinical evaluation. A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect.

These three neurotransmitters have been the focus of considerable research because the modulation of their production and their interaction at monoamine receptors has profound effects upon a multitude of pharmacological outcomes. Our interest has focused on neurotransmitter reuptake mechanisms in a search for medications for cocaine abuse.

In these studies, a discrepancy between in vitro binding affinity, in vivo occupancy, and behavioral potency has been observed. The purpose of this study was to examine (1) modifications of the 2-pyridylphenyl moiety of 6 and (2) hydroxyl, acetyl, and cyclopropyl substitutions on the butylamide linking chain systematically coupled with 2-fluorenylamide or 2-pyridylphenylamide and 2-methoxy- or 2,3-dichloro-substituted phenylpiperazines to measure the impact on binding affinity, D2/D3 selectivity, lipophilicity, and function. In general, these modifications were well tolerated at the human dopamine D3 (hD3) receptor (Ki = 1-5 nM) as measured in competition binding assays. Several analogues showed >100-fold selectivity for dopamine D3 over D2 and D4 receptors. In addition, while all the derivatives with an olefinic linker were antagonists, in quinpirole-stimulated mitogenesis at hD3 receptors, several of the hydroxybutyl-linked analogues (16, 17, 21) showed partial agonist activity.

Various analogues as positional isomers have been developed where location of the phenolic hydroxyl group has been varied on the aromatic ring. Between two catechol derivatives, compound 6e with a two methylene linker length exhibited higher affinity and selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors over compound 6f with four methylene linkers (D2/D3 = 50.6 vs 7.51 for 6e and 6f, respectively). In general, the (-)-isomer was more potent than the (+)-isomeric counterpart. Binding results indicated highest selectivity for D3 receptors in compound (-)- 10 ( K i = 0.35 nM; D2/D3 = 71). In the 5-hydroxy series, highest selectivity for D3 receptors was exhibited by compound (-)- 25 ( K i = 0.82 nM; D2/D3 = 31.5). Most potent compounds exhibited binding and functional affinities at the sub-nanomolar level for the D3 receptor. Binding assays were carried out with HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 receptors by using tritiated spiperone as radioligand for competition studies to evaluate inhibition constants ( K i). A functional assay of selected compounds for stimulating GTPgammaS binding was carried out with CHO cells expressing human D2 receptors and AtT-20 cells expressing human D3 receptors. The functional assay results indicated partial to full agonist characteristics of test compounds.

Various analogues as positional isomers have been developed where location of the phenolic hydroxyl group has been varied on the aromatic ring. Between two catechol derivatives, compound 6e with a two methylene linker length exhibited higher affinity and selectivity for D3 over D2 receptors over compound 6f with four methylene linkers (D2/D3 = 50.6 vs 7.51 for 6e and 6f, respectively). In general, the (-)-isomer was more potent than the (+)-isomeric counterpart. Binding results indicated highest selectivity for D3 receptors in compound (-)- 10 ( K i = 0.35 nM; D2/D3 = 71). In the 5-hydroxy series, highest selectivity for D3 receptors was exhibited by compound (-)- 25 ( K i = 0.82 nM; D2/D3 = 31.5). Most potent compounds exhibited binding and functional affinities at the sub-nanomolar level for the D3 receptor. Binding assays were carried out with HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 receptors by using tritiated spiperone as radioligand for competition studies to evaluate inhibition constants ( K i). A functional assay of selected compounds for stimulating GTPgammaS binding was carried out with CHO cells expressing human D2 receptors and AtT-20 cells expressing human D3 receptors.

Selective alpha(1)-adrenoreceptor antagonists though have many advantages and uses in the management of arterial hypertension, their lack of specificity at the level of alpha(1)-adr subtypes leads to multiple side effects. Existence of multiple alpha(1)-adr subtypes holds great promise for the discovery and development of more specific and selective drug molecules, targeting only one alpha(1)-adr subtype at a time and thus relative freedom from side effects. Herein, the research done on the discovery and evaluation of a variety of chemically diverse structures as selective antagonists of alpha(1)-adr and alpha(1)-adr subtypes in recent years has been reviewed.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL979559,20181025,60820,103169858,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18378462,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Further exploration of both N-substituted and aryl ring-substituted analogues resulted in the discovery of several high affinity D2R/D3R ligands with 3-benzofurylmethyl-substituents (e.g., 45, K(i)(D2R/D3R) = 1.7:0.34 nM) that induced high affinity not achieved in similarly N-substituted piperidine analogues and significantly (470-fold) improved D3R binding affinity compared to the parent ligand 1.

Further SAR on reducing the basicity of the piperidine and introducing polarity led to the discovery of 3-axial fluoropiperidine 30 with a significantly improved selectivity profile.

Compounds were subjected to [(3)H]spiperone binding assays, carried out with HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 dopamine receptors, in order to evaluate their inhibition constant (K(i)) at these receptors. Results indicate that N-substitution on the piperazine ring can accommodate various substituted indole rings. The results also show that in order to maintain high affinity and selectivity for the D3 receptor the heterocyclic ring does not need to be connected directly to the piperazine ring as the majority of compounds included here are linked either via an amide or a methylene linker to the heterocyclic moiety. The enantiomers of the most potent racemic compound 10e exhibited differential activity with (-)-10e (K(i); D2=47.5 nM, D3=0.57 nM) displaying higher affinity at both D2 and D3 receptors compared to its enantiomer (+)-10e (K(i); D2=113 nM, D3=3.73 nM). Additionally, compound (-)-10e was more potent and selective for the D3 receptor compared to either 7-OH-DPAT or 5-OH-DPAT. Among the bioisosteric derivatives, the indazole derivative 10g and benzo[b]thiophene derivative 10i exhibited the highest affinity for D2 and D3 receptors.

In our overall goal to develop bifunctional/multifunctional drugs, we designed dopamine D2/D3 agonist molecules with a capacity to bind to iron. Binding assays were carried out with HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 receptor with tritiated spiperone to evaluate inhibition constants (K(i)). Functional activity of selected compounds was carried out with GTPgammaS binding assay. SAR results identified compounds (+)-19a and (-)-19b as two potent agonists for both D2 and D3 receptors (EC(50) (GTPgammaS); D2 = 4.51 and 1.69 nM and D3 = 1.58 and 0.74 nM for (-)-19b and (+)-19a, respectively). In vitro complexation studies with 19b demonstrated efficient chelation with iron. Furthermore, the deoxyribose assay with 19b demonstrated potent antioxidant activity.

To find out if such an exchange also works for structural moieties that simulate the endogenous neurotransmitter, π1 or π2 or both systems π1 and π2 of three representative privileged structures of types 1, 2, and 3 were replaced by a [2.2]paracyclophane unit. Contributions of the respective functionalities to the binding affinities of a panel of relevant monoaminergic GPCRs were systematically examined. The study led to the paracyclophanylpiperazine 3a displaying excellent D(3) affinity (K(i) = 1.6 nM) and a strongly attenuated binding to D(4), 5-HT(1) and α(1).

Toward a treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis._||_Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness, paralysis, and death, most often from respiratory failure. The only FDA-approved drug for the treatment of ALS, riluzole, only extends the median survival in patients by 2-3 months. There is an urgent need for novel therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease. Using a high-throughput screening assay targeting an ALS cultured cell model (PC12-G93A-YFP cell line), we previously identified three chemotypes that were neuroprotective. We present a further detailed analysis of one promising scaffold from that group, pyrimidine-2,4,6-triones (PYTs), characterizing a number of PYT analogues using SAR and ADME. The PYT compounds show good potency, superior ADME data, low toxicity, brain penetration, and excellent oral bioavailability. Compounds from this series show 100% efficacy in the protection assay with a good correlation in activity between the protection and protein aggregation assays. The modifications of the PYT scaffold presented here suggest that this chemical structure may be a novel drug candidate scaffold for use in clinical trials in ALS.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1769319,20180918,2187415,131285791,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21375347,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

According to these data, the superior affinity of the eutomer 5a is caused by the favorable binding energy that results from interaction between the ligand's central ammonium unit and the aspartate residue in position 3.32 of the receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1768398,20200629,10939167|11615489|52937875|52937876,103469870|103472599|131282732|131284735,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21388142,0,NULL,P35462,9606,45,,NULL

Such changes were expected to be almost isosteric with 1, confer greater metabolic resistance, and in the case of the 4-(4-cyanotetrahydro-2H-pyranyl) compounds, substantially reduce lipophilicity. One derivative, 1-(2-bromophenyl)-N-(1-cyanocyclohexyl)-5-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide (9n), showed high affinity (K(i) = 15.7 nM) and selectivity for binding to CB(1) receptors. The corresponding 4-(4-cyanotetrahydro-2H-pyranyl) derivative (9m) also showed quite high affinity for CB(1) receptors (K(i) = 62 nM) but was found to have even higher affinity (K(i) = 29 nM) for the structurally unrelated 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO). Some other minor structural changes among 9a-s were also found to switch binding selectivity from CB(1) receptors to TSPO or vice versa.

The human 5-HT(2A/2C) receptor has been implicated in several neurological conditions, and potent selective 5-HT(2A/2C) ligands may have therapeutic potential for treatment of CNS diseases such as depression. An imidazole moiety usually provides good pharmacokinetic properties as a drug substance, and thus considerable efforts have been devoted to develop imidazole derivatives into drug candidates. The imidazole series of compounds was evaluated against 5-HT(2A/2C) and serotonin reuptake inhibition. A few of the compounds in the series showed promising IC(50) values and antidepressant-like effect in in vivo forced swimming test (FST). On the basis of these results, further lead optimization studies resulted in identifying promising compounds potentially for therapeutic use.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1827740,20180919,90664601|90664962,242611246|242611904,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,21823597,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The high sequence homology between the D3R and D2R, especially within the orthosteric binding site (OBS) that binds dopamine, has made the development of D3R-selective compounds challenging. Here, we deconstruct into pharmacophoric elements a series of D3R-selective substituted-4-phenylpiperazine compounds and use computational simulations and binding and activation studies to dissect the structural bases for D3R selectivity and efficacy. We find that selectivity arises from divergent interactions within a second binding pocket (SBP) separate from the OBS, whereas efficacy depends on the binding mode in the OBS. Our findings reveal structural features of the receptor that are critical to selectivity and efficacy that can be used to design highly D3R-selective ligands with targeted efficacies. These findings are generalizable to other GPCRs in which the SBP can be targeted by bitopic or allosteric ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2167819,20180923,1346|54562|9859120|10354670|12461787|15356306|19871273|44203057|53248299|53248300|58358826,103169108|103196922|103543557|163313965|163324236|163327704|163327705|163327706|163334553|163334704|163334705,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,22632094,0,NULL,P35462,9606,54,,NULL

Herein we describe the synthesis and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies around a series of mGlu(2) receptor positive allosteric modulators (PAMs). The effects of N-substitution (R(1)) and substitutions on the aryl ring (R(2)) were identified as key areas for SAR exploration (Figure 3). Investigation of the effects of varying substituents in both the isoindolinone (2) and benzisothiazolone (3) series led to compounds with improved in vitro potency and/or efficacy. In addition, several analogues exhibited promising pharmacokinetic (PK) properties.

In addition, we wanted to explore the effect of derivatization of functional groups of the agonist binding moiety in compounds developed by us earlier from the hybrid template. Binding affinity (K(i)) of the new compounds was measured with tritiated spiperone as the radioligand and HEK-293 cells expressing either D2 or D3 receptors. Functional activity of selected compounds was assessed in the GTPγS binding assay. In the imidazole series, compound 10a exhibited the highest D3 affinity whereas the indole derivative 13 exhibited similar high D3 affinity.

This perspective reviews these interconnected aspects of polypharmacology. The first part discusses the relevance of polypharmacology for the safety of drugs, the mitigation of safety risks, and methods to identify polypharmacological compounds early in the drug discovery process. The second part discusses the advantages of polypharmacology in the treatment of multigenic diseases and infections, and opportunities for drug discovery and drug repurposing.

Agonist D2/3 tracers for PET/SPECT imaging are considered to be superior to antagonists because they are more sensitive to dopamine concentrations and may selectively label the high-affinity receptor state.

1152405,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]N-methylspiperone from human dopamine D3 receptor by PDSP assay,"Title: Identification of a new selective dopamine D4 receptor ligand._||_Abstract: The dopamine D4 receptor has been shown to play key roles in certain CNS pathologies including addiction to cigarette smoking. Thus, selective D4 ligands may be useful in treating some of these conditions. Previous studies in our laboratory have indicated that the piperazine analog of haloperidol exhibits selective and increased affinity to the DAD4 receptor subtype, in comparison to its piperidine analog. This led to further exploration of the piperazine moiety to identify new agents that are selective at the D4 receptor. Compound 27 (KiD4=0.84 nM) was the most potent of the compounds tested. However, it only had moderate selectivity for the D4 receptor. Compound 28 (KiD4=3.9 nM) while not as potent, was more discriminatory for the D4 receptor subtype. In fact, compound 28 has little or no binding affinity to any of the other four DA receptor subtypes.

In vitro studies confirmed their antagonism of 5-HT(7/2A) and D2 receptors and weak interactions with key antitargets (M1R and hERG) associated with side effects. Marked 5-HT6 receptor affinities were also observed, notably for 6-fluoro-3-(piperidin-4-yl)-1,2-benzoxazole derivatives connected by a 3-4 unit alkyl linker with mono- or bicyclic, lipophilic arylsulfonamide moieties. N-[4-[4-(6-Fluoro-1,2-benzoxazol-3-yl)piperidin-1-yl]butyl]benzothiophene-2-sulfonamide (72) was characterized in vitro on 14 targets and antitargets. It displayed dual blockade of 5-HT6 and D2 receptors and negligible interactions at hERG and M1 receptors. Unlike reference antipsychotics, 72 displayed marked antipsychotic and antidepressant activity in rats after oral administration, in the absence of cognitive or motor impairment. This profile is particularly attractive when targeting a fragile, elderly BPSD patient population.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3295665,20200618,37459|56944383,103167599|242648820,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,24805037,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

This study describes the development of a series of novel bivalent molecules with a pharmacophore derived from the dopamine receptor antagonist haloperidol. These dimers were investigated in comparison to their monomeric analogues for their D2long, D2short, D3, and D4 receptor binding and the ability to bridge two neighboring receptor protomers.

However, the majority of the nNOS inhibitors developed are arginine mimetics and, therefore, suffer from poor bioavailability. We designed a novel strategy to combine a more pharmacokinetically favorable 2-imidazolylpyrimidine head with promising structural components from previous inhibitors. In conjunction with extensive structure-activity studies, several highly potent and selective inhibitors of nNOS were discovered. X-ray crystallographic analysis reveals that these type II inhibitors utilize the same hydrophobic pocket to gain strong inhibitory potency (13), as well as high isoform selectivity. Interestingly, select compounds from this series (9) showed good permeability and low efflux in a Caco-2 assay, suggesting potential oral bioavailability, and exhibited minimal off-target binding to 50 central nervous system receptors. Furthermore, even with heme-coordinating groups in the molecule, modifying other pharmacophoric fragments minimized undesirable inhibition of cytochrome P450s from human liver microsomes.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3411179,20181006,118730369,312384124,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25489882,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

It displayed potent antidepressant-like and anxiolytic-like activity in the Porsolt and Vogel tests, respectively, more pronounced than that of a reference selective 5-HT6R antagonist or D2R partial agonist. In addition, 47 also showed antidepressant-like activity (Porsolt's test) and anxiolytic-like activity (open field test) in aged (>18-month old) rats. In operant conditioning tests, 47 enhanced responding for sweet reward in the saccharin self-administration test, consistent with anti-anhedonic properties. Further, 47 facilitated extinction of non-reinforced responding for sweet reward, suggesting potential procognitive activity.

Modifications focused on the alkoxyl substituent present on the aromatic ring led to the identification of improved ligands with better potency at the 5-HT2C receptor and excellent selectivity against the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptors. ADMET studies coupled with a behavioral test using the amphetamine-induced hyperactivity model identified four compounds possessing drug-like profiles and having antipsychotic properties. Compound (+)-16b, which displayed an EC50 of 4.2 nM at 5-HT2C, no activity at 5-HT2B, and an 89-fold selectivity against 5-HT2A, is one of the most potent and selective 5-HT2C agonists reported to date. The likely binding mode of this series of compounds to the 5-HT2C receptor was also investigated in a modeling study, using optimized models incorporating the structures of β2-adrenergic receptor and 5-HT2B receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3420910,20200625,92042918,312388817,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,25633969,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

Compounds with purine-2,4-dione nucleus generally had affinity values higher than the corresponding purine-2,4,8-trione compounds. A spectrum of receptor activities was observed for compounds with a substituent at the 7-position of the imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione system and some potent 5-HT1A (18, 25), 5-HT7 (14) and mixed 5-HT1A/5-HT7 (8, 9) receptor ligands with additional affinity for dopamine D2 receptors (15) has been identified. Moreover, docking studies proved that a substituent at the 7-position of 1,3-dimethyl-(1H,8H)-imidazo[2,1-f]purine-2,4-dione could be essential for receptor affinity and selectivity, especially towards 5-HT1A and 5-HT7.

However, the high sequence homology between D3R and the D2 receptor (D2R) challenges the development of D3R-biased compounds. Herein, we design and synthesize a novel series of reverse amide-piperazine hybrid ligands and evaluate their biological affinities in vitro.

However, the high sequence homology between D3R and the D2 receptor (D2R) challenges the development of D3R-biased compounds. Herein, we design and synthesize a novel series of reverse amide-piperazine hybrid ligands and evaluate their biological affinities in vitro.

In general, unlike nantenine, the analogs lack affinity for the h5-HT(2A) receptor and other 5-HT receptors but bind selectively to the h5-HT(2B) receptor. With regards to 5-HT(2B) affinity, there appears to be a low tolerance for bulky C1 or N-substituents when the C4 phenyl moiety is present.

In most of the top-selling antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole and risperidone, high affinity to both receptors can be attributed to the presence of 1,4-disubstituted aromatic piperazines or piperidines as primary receptor recognition elements. Taking advantage of our in-house library of phenylpiperazine-derived dopamine receptor ligands and experimental data, we established highly significant CoMFA and CoMSIA models for the prediction of 5-HT2A over D2 selectivity. Subsequently, the models were applied to identify the selective candidates 55-57 from our newly synthesized library of GPCR ligands comprising a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine head group and a 1,2,3-triazole based linker unit. The test compound 57 showed subnanomolar a Ki value (0.64 nM) for 5-HT2A and more than 10- and 30-fold selectivity over the dopamine receptor isoforms D2S and D2L, respectively.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3614292,20181009,122189387|122189388|122189389|122189390|122189391|122189392|122189393|122189394,318388408|318388409|318388410|318388411|318388412|318388413|318388414|318388415,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26299826,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

Reengineering these agents (TFP, CPZ, CIP) by replacing the basic amine with a neutral polar functional group (e.g., RTC-1, RTC-2) abrogated their CNS effects as demonstrated by in vitro pharmacological assays and in vivo behavioral models. Further optimization generated several phenothiazines and dibenzazepines with improved anti-cancer potency, exemplified by RTC-5.

The synthesis relies on the key multicomponent split-Ugi reaction, assessing its great potential in generating chemical diversity around the piperazine core. With the aim of evaluating the effect of such diversity on the dopamine receptor affinity, a small library of compounds was prepared, applying post-Ugi transformations. Ligand stimulated binding assays indicated that some compounds show a significant affinity, with K i values up to 53 nM for the D2 receptor. Molecular docking studies with the D2 and D3 receptor homology models were also performed on selected compounds. They highlighted key interactions at the indole head and at the piperazine moiety, which resulted in good agreement with the known pharmacophore models, thus helping to explain the observed structure-activity relationship data. Molecular insights from this study could enable a rational improvement of the split-Ugi primary scaffold, toward more selective ligands.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3626474,20181009,3559|122191600|122191601|122191602|122191603|122191604|122191605|122191606|122191607|122191608|122191609|122191610|122191611,103167216|318391589|318391590|318391591|318391592|318391593|318391594|318391595|318391596|318391597|318391598|318391599|318391600,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,26288260,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

1272383,Confirmatory,Binding affinity to D3 dopamine receptor (unknown origin) by competition binding assay,"Title: Receptor binding profiles and quantitative structure-affinity relationships of some 5-substituted-N,N-diallyltryptamines._||_Abstract: N,N-Diallyltryptamine (DALT) and 5-methoxy-N,N-diallyltryptamine (5-MeO-DALT) are two tryptamines synthesized and tested by Alexander Shulgin. In self-experiments, 5-MeO-DALT was reported to be psychoactive in the 12-20mg range, while the unsubstituted compound DALT had few discernible effects in the 42-80 mg range. Recently, 5-MeO-DALT has been used in nonmedical settings for its psychoactive effects, but these effects have been poorly characterized and little is known of its pharmacological properties. We extended the work of Shulgin by synthesizing additional 5-substituted-DALTs. We then compared them to DALT and 5-MeO-DALT for their binding affinities at 45 cloned receptors and transporter proteins. Based on in vitro binding affinity, we identified 27 potential receptor targets for the 5-substituted-DALT compounds. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 10-80 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2B receptors, while the affinity of DALT itself at 5-HT1A receptors was slightly lower at 100 nM. Among the 5-HT2 subtypes, the weakest affinity was at 5-HT2A receptors, spanning 250-730 nM. Five of the DALT compounds had affinity in the 50-400 nM range for serotonin 5-HT1D, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors; again, it was the unsubstituted DALT that had the weakest affinity at all three subtypes. The test drugs had even weaker affinity for 5-HT1B, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT5A subtypes and little or no affinity for the 5-HT3 subtype. These compounds also had generally nanomolar affinities for adrenergic α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, sigma receptors σ1 and σ2, histamine H1 receptors, and norepinephrine and serotonin uptake transporters. They also bound to other targets in the nanomolar-to-low micromolar range. Based on these binding results, it is likely that multiple serotonin receptors, as well as several nonserotonergic sites are important for the psychoactive effects of DALT drugs. To learn whether any quantitative structure-affinity relationships existed, we evaluated correlations among physicochemical properties of the congeneric 5-substituted-DALT compounds. The descriptors included electronic (σp), hydrophobic (π), and steric (CMR) parameters. The binding affinity at 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D, 5-HT7, and κ opioid receptors was positively correlated with the steric volume parameter CMR. At α2A, α2B, and α2C receptors, and at the histamine H1 receptor, binding affinity was correlated with the Hammett substituent parameter σp; higher affinity was associated with larger σp values.

Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase plays a key role in local tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway and has emerged as a therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapy. Our prior study identified phenyl benzenesulfonyl hydrazide 2 as a potent in vitro (though not in vivo) inhibitor of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Further lead optimization to improve in vitro potencies and pharmacokinetic profiles resulted in N'-(4-bromophenyl)-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indole-5-sulfonyl hydrazide 40, which demonstrated 59% oral bioavailability and 73% of tumor growth delay without apparent body weight loss in the murine CT26 syngeneic model, after oral administration of 400 mg/kg.

1298709,Confirmatory,Displacement of [3H]spiperone from human D3 receptor expressed in CHO cells,"Title: Structure-guided development of dual β2 adrenergic/dopamine D2 receptor agonists._||_Abstract: Aiming to discover dual-acting β2 adrenergic/dopamine D2 receptor ligands, a structure-guided approach for the evolution of GPCR agonists that address multiple targets was elaborated. Starting from GPCR crystal structures, we describe the design, synthesis and biological investigation of a defined set of compounds leading to the identification of the benzoxazinone (R)-3, which shows agonist properties at the adrenergic β2 receptor and substantial G protein-promoted activation at the D2 receptor.

As part of our search to identify dual targeting ligands for these receptors, we have carried out a systematic modification of a selective 5HT7 receptor ligand culminating in the identification of several dual 5-HT1A and 5-HT7 receptor ligands. Compound 16, a butyrophenone derivative of tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ), was identified as the most potent agent with low nanomolar binding affinities to both receptors. Interestingly, compound 16 also displayed moderate affinity to other clinically relevant dopamine receptors.

The atypical DAT inhibitors have received attention due to their promising pharmacological profiles in animal models of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse. Herein, we report a series of modafinil analogues that have an atypical DAT inhibitor profile. We extended SAR by chemically manipulating the oxidation states of the sulfoxide and the amide functional groups, halogenating the phenyl rings, and/or functionalizing the terminal nitrogen with substituted piperazines, resulting in several novel leads such as 11b, which demonstrated high DAT affinity (Ki = 2.5 nM) and selectivity without producing concomitant locomotor stimulation in mice, as compared to cocaine.

Small n-alkoxy substituents (up to 4 carbons in length) were generally well tolerated for high D1 affinity but such groups reduced D3 affinity. In the case of C12 brominated analogues, C9 alkoxylation also had little effect on D1 affinity for the smaller alkoxy groups, but reduced D2 and D3 affinities significantly. C12 bromination tends to increase D1 receptor selectivity. A number of compounds were identified that retain affinity for D1 and D3 receptors but lack D2 receptor affinity. Among them, compound 22a was found to be a selective D1/D3 dual antagonist (Ki = 5.3 and 106 nM at D1 and D3 receptors). Docking studies performed on the analogues at the D3 receptor revealed a number of interactions that are important for affinity including a critical N - Asp110 salt bridge motif, H-bonds to Ser192 and Cys181 and hydrophobic interactions between the aryl rings and Phe106 and Phe345. The analogues adopt an orientation in which ring A is located in the orthosteric binding site while the C9 alkoxy substituents attached to ring D project into the secondary binding pocket of the D3 receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL3877890,20180907,134155502,374352623,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27688181,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

Hydrogen bonding between Ser 182 and Tyr 365 at D3R stabilize extracellular loop 2 (ECL2), which in turn contributes to ligand binding by interacting with the 'tail' units of the ligands in the secondary binding pocket. Similar interactions between ECL2 and the 'tail' units were absent at D2R due to different positioning of the D2R loop region. The presence of multiple H-bonds with the phenol moiety of the headgroup of 7 and Ser192 accounts for its stronger D3R affinity as compared to the 6,7-dimethoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-containing analogue 8.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4269475,20200619,145988474|145989012|145993700|145993990,404709609|404710458|404717809|404718304,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,30344905,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

The configuration in 2-position does not influence the σ1 affinity and selectivity over related receptors. A cyclohexylmethyl or a butyl group are the preferred substituents in 4-position, whereas a methyl moiety in 2-position and a (substituted) benzyl moiety in 1-position result in the highest σ1 affinity. These results fit nicely to the reported σ1 pharmacophore models.

To better understand the structural features required for the selective interaction with the D4R and to obtain compounds unable to activate mAChRs, the aliphatic butyl chain and the piperidine nucleus of 1 were modified, affording compounds 2-14. The 4-benzylpiperidine 9 and the 4-phenylpiperazine 12 showed high D4R affinity and selectivity not only over the other D2-like subtypes, but also over M1-M5 mAChRs. Derivative 12 was also highly selective over some selected off-targets. This compound showed biased behavior, potently and partially activating Gi protein and inhibiting β-arrestin2 recruitment in functional studies. Pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that it was characterized by a relevant brain penetration. Therefore, 12 might be a useful tool to better clarify the role played by D4R in disorders in which this subtype is involved.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4048884,20200622,5311200|10236758|14925759|118719925|118719926|118719927|137635734|137636308|137640201|137640511|137642607|137644962|137645938|137655636|137661377,103165750|312367788|312367795|312367796|312367797|381843094|381843916|381849708|381850208|381853300|381856133|381856754|381858210|381872580|381886515,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,29589445,0,NULL,P35462,9606,45,,NULL

Previous work has exemplified the use of bitopic ligands as a powerful strategy in achieving subtype selectivity for agonists and antagonists alike. Inspired by the potential for chemical modification of the D3 preferential agonists (+)-PD128,907 (1) and PF592,379 (2), we synthesized bitopic structures to further improve their D3R selectivity. We found that the (2S,5S) conformation of scaffold 2 resulted in a privileged architecture with increased affinity and selectivity for the D3R. In addition, a cyclopropyl moiety incorporated into the linker and full resolution of the chiral centers resulted in lead compound 53 and eutomer 53a that demonstrate significantly higher D3R binding selectivities than the reference compounds.

Herein, we present derivatives of 1 with comparable D<sub>3</sub>R affinity (32, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 3.2 nM, D<sub>2</sub>R/D<sub>3</sub>R ratio = 60) and selectivity (30, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 21.0 nM, D<sub>2</sub>R/D<sub>3</sub>R ratio = 934). Fragmentation of 1 revealed orthosteric fragment 5a to express an unusually low D<sub>3</sub>R affinity ( K<sub>i</sub> = 2.7 μM). Compared to piperazine congener 31, which retains a high-affinity orthosteric fragment (5d, D<sub>3</sub>R K<sub>i</sub> = 23.9 nM), 1 was found to be more selective for the D<sub>3</sub>R among D<sub>1</sub>- and D<sub>2</sub>-like receptors and exhibited negligible off-target interactions at serotoninergic and adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), common off-target sites for piperazine-containing D<sub>3</sub>R scaffolds. This study provides a unique rationale for implementing weakly potent orthosteric fragments into D<sub>3</sub>R ligand systems to minimize drug promiscuity at other aminergic GPCR sites.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4397359,20210302,54562|137645406|137646281,103543557|381857404|381858709,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,31021617,0,NULL,P35462,9606,NULL,,NULL

In this frame, following our interest in the development of molecules able to modulate either the endocannabinoid or the dopaminergic system, and given the multiple and reciprocal interconnections between them, we decided to merge the pharmacophoric elements of some of our early leads for identifying new molecules as tools able to modulate both systems. We herein describe the synthesis and biological characterization of compounds 5a-j inspired by the structure of our potent and selective fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitors (3a-c) and ligands of dopamine D<sub>2</sub> or D<sub>3</sub> receptor subtypes (4a,b). Notably, the majority of the new molecules showed a nanomolar potency of interaction with the targets of interest. The drug-likeliness of the developed compounds (5a-j) was investigated in silico while hERG affinity, selectivity profile (for some proteins of the endocannabinoid system), cytotoxicity profiles (on fibroblast and astrocytes), and mutagenicity (Ames test) were experimentally determined. Metabolic studies also served to complement the preliminary drug-likeliness profiling for compounds 3a and 5c.

In addition, pretreatment with 19 also dose-dependently inhibited the acquisition of oxycodone-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in rats. These findings support the D3R as a target for opioid dependence treatment and compound 19 as a new lead molecule for development.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL4429159,20210302,130431277|130431287|130431316|130431317|130431318|130431325|130431337|130431342|130431351|155514430|155533824|155535272|155552695,440111590|440115654|440116525|440126918|440135799|440145346|440147564|440152147|440152800|440157086|440162869|440187374|440188171,1814,NULL,P35462,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,27508895,0,NULL,P35462,9606,197,,NULL

In our design we appended various catechol and related phenol derivatives to the parent agonists via different linker lengths. Structural optimization led to development of several potent agonists among which (-)-8a, (-)-14 and (-)-20 exhibited potent neuroprotective properties in a cellular PD model involving neurotoxin 6-OHDA. The lead compounds (-)-8a and (-)-14 were able to modulate aggregation of α-synuclein protein efficiently.

Jeffrey Conn_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of novel allosteric modulators of the M1 muscarinic receptor_||_Grant Number: 1 R03 MH077606-01_||_The M1 muscarinic receptor is thought to be an important therapeutic target in schizophrenia. A cell-based fluorometric calcium assay was developed for high throughput screening. This assay was used to identify compounds with high selectivity for the M1 receptor subtype that act at an allosteric site on the receptor, thus providing increased specificity for this single receptor subtype. It is anticipated that these compounds will provide important tools for the study of muscarinic receptor function in the CNS._||_Agents that enhance cholinergic transmission or activate muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) have been developed to ameliorate the loss of cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). While cholinergic agents have been partially successful in improving cognitive function in AD patients, the most exciting findings coming from clinical studies with these agents have been the demonstration of efficacy in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients with AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Interestingly, the M1/M4 preferring mAChR agonist, xanomeline, also induces a robust antipsychotic effect in schizophrenic patients, suggesting that mAChR agonists may have broad utility in reducing psychotic symptoms in patients suffering from schizophrenia and certain neurodegenerative disorders._||_Evidence suggests that the antipsychotic effects of cholinergic agents may be mediated by the M1 mAChR subtype. However, previous compounds developed to selectively activate M1 receptors have failed in clinical development due to a lack of true specificity for M1 and adverse effects associated with activation of other mAChR subtypes. Furthermore, the lack of highly selective compounds has made it impossible to definitively determine whether the behavioral and clinical effects of these compounds are mediated by M1 and the M4 receptor subtype is also a viable candidate for mediating the antipsychotic effects._||_Previous attempts to develop agonists and antagonists that are highly selective for M1 or other specific mAChR subtypes have failed because of the high conservation of the ACh binding site and difficulty in developing compounds that are truly specific. However, in recent years, major advances have been made in discovery of highly selective antagonists of other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that act at allosteric sites rather than the orthosteric neurotransmitter binding site [1, 2]. These compounds induce a noncompetitive blockade of receptor function and tend to be highly selective for the targeted receptor. Even more promising for discovery of M1-selective agonists, novel compounds have now been discovered that act at an allosteric site on M1 receptor rather than the orthosteric ACh-binding site to induce a robust activation of the receptor and provide high receptor subtype specificity [3, 4]._||_1.May, L.T. and A.

For instance, KCC2, a neuronal-specific K-Cl cotransporter is up-regulated in the brain during postnatal development, and is responsible for lowering the intracellular Cl- concentration in neurons, thus promoting GABA inhibition. Reduction in KCC2 expression results in brain hyperexcitability, as demonstrated by animal models. Furthermore, KCC2 expression is decreased in brain tissue isolated from epileptic patients._||_There are very few pharmacological agents that affect K-Cl cotransporters. First, there are no specific inhibitors of K-Cl cotransporters. Furosemide is mostly used to inhibit K-Cl cotransporter function, but the diuretic is not very potent and is not specific as it inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (diuretic effect), many Cl- channels including the GABAA receptor. Finding new inhibitors will provide important tools for the study of KCC2 in modulating inhibitory neurotransmission. Second, there are also no compounds known to activate K-Cl cotransporter, except for N-ethylmaleimide, which affects many cellular processes as an unspecific alkylating agent. Finding a specific agent that increase KCC2 function would potentially have therapeutic value, as increased KCC2 function reduces susceptibility to epileptic seizures.",23,Vanderbilt High Throughput Screening Facility,ED001_Antag_MDS,20090528,25067404,56405461,134|135|140|146|150|153|154|623|624|1128|1129|1131|1134|1136|1812|1813|1814|1815|1909|1910|2099|2550|2908|3269|3274|3350|3757|4543|4886|4887|4985|4986|4988|5734|6530|6531|6532|6869|10280|10800|14811|16177|24173|24208|24408|24410|25265|25399|29336|29412|29559|29709|81574|81812|83612|84109|257648|306255|101823647,NULL,AAD14378|NP_000015|NP_000070|NP_000106|NP_000116|NP_000229|NP_000515|NP_000614|NP_000665|NP_000666|NP_000669|NP_000672|NP_000675|NP_000701|NP_000729|NP_000730|NP_000731|NP_000734|NP_000785|NP_000787|NP_000788|NP_000900|NP_000901|NP_000902|NP_000903|NP_000905|NP_000949|NP_001018087|NP_001034|NP_001035|NP_001036|NP_001049|NP_001091683|NP_001461|NP_001948|NP_005857|NP_005949|NP_006630|NP_032196|NP_032388|NP_036634|NP_036706|NP_036932|NP_037051|NP_057658|NP_058687|NP_058706|NP_058887|NP_058937|NP_071640|NP_110502|NP_112258|NP_112396|NP_113970|NP_671482|NP_899156|NP_937822|P49658|XP_001057307,NIH Initiatives,19279215,0,3.2.2.6,AAD14378|NP_037051|NP_058687|NP_671482|O35458|P02708|P03372|P04150|P04774|P07550|P08172|P08588|P08908|P08913|P11229|P13504|P14416|P15207|P18508|P20309|P21728|P21917|P22756|P23975|P24530|P25021|P25100|P25101|P25103|P25929|P29274|P30411|P30542|P31645|P32297|P35367|P35372|P35408|P35436|P35439|P35462|P41143|P41145|P43140|P46663|P48039|P49146|P49651|P49658|P63059|Q00960|Q01959|Q12809|Q96P65|Q99720|Q9R0C9|Q9UBS5|Q9Y271|XP_001057307,NULL,NULL,,NULL
1921,Other,Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator: Ancillary Activity,"Assay Provider: Colleen Niswender_||_Assay Provider Affiliation: Vanderbilt University_||_Grant Title: Discovery of a Highly Selective in vitro and in vivo M4 Positive Allosteric Modulator(PAM)_||_Grant Number: MH077607-1_||_To date, five muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes have been identified (M1-M5) and play important roles in mediating the actions of ACh in the peripheral and central nervous systems. Of these, M1 and M4 are the most heavily expressed in the CNS and represent attractive therapeutic targets for cognition, Alzheimer's disease, and schizophrenia. In contrast, the adverse effects of cholinergic agents are thought to be primarily due to activation of peripheral M2 and M3 mAChRs. Due to the high sequence homology and conservation of the orthosteric ACh binding site among the mAChR subtypes, development of chemical agents that are selective for a single subtype has been largely unsuccessful, and in the absence of highly selective activators of M4, it has been impossible to test the role of selective M4 activation. Clinical trials with xanomeline, a M1/M4-preferring orthosteric agonist, demonstrated efficacy as both a cognition-enhancing agent and an antipsychotic agent. In follow-up studies in rats, xanomeline displayed an antipsychotic-like profile comparable to clozapine. However, a long standing question concerned whether or not the antipsychotic efficacy or antipsychotic-like activity in animal models is mediated by activation of M1, M4, or a combination of both receptors. Data from mAChR knockout mice led to the suggestion that a selective M1 agonist would be beneficial for cognition, whereas an M4 agonist would provide antipsychotic activity for the treatment of schizophrenia. This proposal is further supported by recent studies demonstrating that M4 receptors modulate the dynamics of cholinergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and that loss of M4 function results in a state of dopamine yperfunction. These data, coupled with findings that schizophrenic patients have altered hippocampal M4 but not M1 receptor expression, suggest that selective activators of M4 may provide a novel treatment strategy for schizophrenia patients. However, multiple studies suggest that M1 may also play an important role in the antipsychotic effects of mAChR agonists and that the relative contributions of M1 and M4 to the antipsychotic efficacy of xanomeline or antipsychotic-like effects of this compound in animal models are not known. However, highly selective centrally penetrant activators of either M1 or M4 have not been available, making it impossible to determine the in vivo effects of selective activation of these receptors.

An emerging body of evidence suggests that ROMK could be a target for a novel class loop diuretic that lowers blood pressure while preserving plasma potassium levels (2).  Furthermore, homozygous loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) cause antenatal Bartter syndrome, a severe salt and water wasting disease in infants (3).  ROMK is thus an important pharmacological target for the management of disease.  Its actual therapeutic value and drugability, however, are unknown due to the lack of small-molecule probes targeting the channel.  The discovery of ROMK modulators will provide important new tools for studying the structure, function and therapeutic potential of ROMK and other inward rectifying potassium channels.  _||_1.Hebert SC, Desir G, Giebisch G, Wang W.

In activated phagocytic cells, the membrane integrated protein gp91phox serves as the catalytic cytochrome b subunit of the respiratory burst oxidase used to generate superoxide in an NADPH-dependent manner for host defense (2). Generation of ROS has also been identified in non-phagocytic cells (3). One important enzyme involved in ROS production in non-leukocyte tissues is NADPH oxidase 1 (NOX1), a homolog of gp91phox.  NOX1 is highly expressed in colon epithelial cells where it can generate ROS to interact with normal and pathogenic bacteria (3-5). However, excess ROS production is associated with damage to the intestinal mucosa, particularly in mucosal lesions of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (4). Studies showing that NOX1 levels are increased in human prostate cancer (6) and that cells overexpressing NOX1 have a transformed appearance, exhibit anchorage-independent growth, and induce vascularized tumor formation in athymic mice (3, 7), suggest that NOX1 may also play a role in angiogenesis, cell growth, and tumor pathogenesis (8, 9). The identification of inhibitors of NOX1 may lead to potential candidates for excess cell proliferation, cancer, and IBD._||_References:_||_1.

Studies show that STAT3 is activated in breast and prostate cancers, and that STAT3 inhibition using RNA interference or a dominant negative leads to reduced cell proliferation, survival, and wound healing (1-5). In addition, the Nuclear Factor-kB (NF-kB) has been recognized as a major pathway for both inflammation-induced carcinogenesis and anti-tumor immunity. Intriguingly, STAT3 and NF-kB are frequently persistently activated in the same tumor cells, and in tumor-associated myeloid cells (6, 7). In such contexts, both transcription factors have crucial and integrated roles in inflammatory responses that promote cancer development and growth. Recently, several studies have suggested that combined STAT3/NF-kB inhibition would be beneficial to tumor prevention and therapy (8-12)._||_In the work we have done so far in developing STAT3 inhibitory probes, a consistent finding has been that compounds that selectively inhibit STAT3 frequently lead to a reciprocal increase in NF-kB activity. This likely reflects loss of expression of negative feedback regulators, and we are currently working to define the mechanism for this. In addition, since NF-kB target genes promote survival and proliferation, this effect may diminish the anti-neoplastic efficacy of a pure STAT3 inhibitor. Thus, a dual STAT3/NF-kB inhibitor holds the promise of being a much more effective anti-cancer agent._||_References:_||_1. Alvarez, J.V., P.G. Febbo, S. Ramaswamy, M. Loda, A. Richardson, and D.A.

The HCV has a small RNA genome that is directly translated by the infected host cell into a single precursor polyprotein that is processed by enzymatic cleavage into 10 proteins of diverse function. The most N-terminal 21kDa protein of this HCV polyprotein is the HCV core (C) protein, which is a highly basic, RNA-binding structural protein essential for assembly and packaging of the viral genome (2). Core protein is cleaved by a host peptidase and anchored to the host cell endoplasmic reticulum, where it undergoes further processing into its mature form (3). The N terminal portion of this mature C protein mediates viral assembly through homodimerization and formation of higher order complexes with viral RNA to form the nucleocapsid, while the hydrophobic C terminal interacts with envelope glycoproteins to form the infectious particle (4). The conserved nature of the HCV protein and absence of a vaccine to prevent HCV infection (5), along with studies demonstrating that C protein contributes to host cell oncogenesis (6), apoptosis inhibition (7), and suppression of host T cell responses (8), support a role for core protein as a major pathogenic component of HCV. The identification of specific inhibitors of HCV core dimerization will provide valuable tools for inhibiting HCV assembly without host cell effects (9)._||_References:_||_1.

652048,Screening,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Agonist: qHTS,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment._||_The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease.

652049,Summary,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Potentiators: Summary,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment._||_The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease.

652052,Summary,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Antagonist: Summary,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. Antagonism of the D3 DAR may also be therapeutic in the treatment of schizophrenia or psychosis. Notably, while all antipsychotic drugs block the D2 DAR, they also block the D3 DAR to various degrees. Since the D3 DAR is expressed in areas of the CNS associated with the control of mood and emotion, it has been hypothesized that selective antagonism of the D3 DAR may be effective in treating psychosis without inducing the motor side effects typically seen with D2 DAR antagonists. Interestingly, D3 DAR antagonism has also been suggested to be highly beneficial in the treatment of certain motor/movement disorders such as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias, which typically arise during late-stage Parkinson's disease treatment._||_The goal of this project is to use high throughput screening approaches to identify and develop novel, highly selective small molecule allosteric modulators of the D3 DAR for use as in vitro and in vivo pharmacological tools and in proof-of-concept experiments in animal models of neuropsychiatric disease. This part of the project aims to discover novel antagonist._||_NIH Chemical Genomics Center [NCGC]_||_NIH Molecular Libraries Probe Centers Network [MLPCN]_||_MLPCN Grant: MH094203_||_Assay Submitter (PI): David Sibley, NINDS",2,National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS),D3Ant000,20130312,NULL,NULL,1814,NULL,NP_387512,Governmental Organizations|NIH Initiatives,NULL,0,NULL,P35462,NULL,NULL,,NULL

720506,Confirmatory,qHTS of D3 Dopamine Receptor Agonist: D3 Dopamine Receptor B-arrestin Agonist Confirmatory Assay,"D3 DARs represent a very important target for the treatment of several neuropsychiatric disorders. Indeed, one of the most promising therapeutic applications for the D3 DAR is in the area of addiction and related disorders. Several lines of evidence suggest that partial agonists or antagonists of the D3 DAR may be therapeutic for drug abuse and relapse. Accumulating evidence suggests that reducing D3 DAR activity may regulate the motivation to self-administer drugs and disrupt drug-associated cue-induced craving and relapse or reinstatement of drug taking. These findings have been observed with a number of addictive substances including cocaine, amphetamine, nicotine, and alcohol. It is particularly interesting that partial agonists are effective in these preclinical models, suggesting that only partial blockade of the D3 DAR is needed and may, in fact, prove to be more beneficial than full blockade. In preclinical animal models, D3 DAR-preferring agonists are the most potent neuroprotective agents identified to date against MPTP-induced neurodegeneration in mice and primates, and against 6-OH-DA-induced lesions in rats.  Increased D3 DAR activity can thus lead to neuroprotective and neurorestorative actions in the CNS.  With respect to other therapeutic applications, stimulation of the D3 DAR has also been shown to promote penile erections thus suggesting a potential role in the treatment of erectile dysfunction. _||_This assay is used to confirm the activity of the identified D3 dopamine receptor agonist.
