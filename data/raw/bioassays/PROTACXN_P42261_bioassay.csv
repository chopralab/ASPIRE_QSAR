75670,Confirmatory,Inhibition of the (-80 mV) current elicited by 100 uM glutamate by simultaneous co-application in xenopus oocytes injected with GluR1 flop RNA.,"Title: Solid-phase synthesis of polyamine toxin analogues: potent and selective antagonists of Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors._||_Abstract: The wasp toxin philanthotoxin-433 (PhTX-433) is a nonselective and noncompetitive antagonist of ionotropic receptors, such as ionotropic glutamate receptors and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Polyamine toxins are extensively used for the characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. We have previously shown that an analogue of PhTX-433 with one of the amino groups replaced by a methylene group, philanthotoxin-83 (PhTX-83) is a selective and potent antagonist of AMPA receptors. We now describe the solid-phase synthesis of analogues of PhTX-83 and the electrophysiological characterization of these analogues on cloned AMPA and kainate receptors. The polyamine portion of PhTX-83 was modified systematically by changing the position of the secondary amino group along the polyamine chain. In another series of analogues, the acyl moiety of PhTX-83 was replaced by acids of different size and lipophilicity. Using electrophysiological techniques, PhTX-56 was shown to be a highly potent (K(i) = 3.3 +/- 0.78 nM) and voltage-dependent antagonist of homomeric GluR1 receptors and was more than 1000-fold less potent when tested on heteromeric GluR1+GluR2, as well as homomeric GluR5(Q) receptors, thus being selective for Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Variation of the acyl group of PhTX-83 had only minor effect on antagonist potency at homomeric GluR1 receptors but led to a significant decrease in the voltage-dependence. In conclusion, PhTX-56 is a novel, very potent, and selective antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and is a promising tool for structure/function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL680870,20181017,10598970|14608128|44368884|44368885|44368886|44368895|44368910|44369047|44369048|44369061|44369062|44369077|44369235|44369248|44369251|44369283|44369293|44369295|44369306|44369308,103242301|103395119|103401345|103401346|103401347|103401358|103401386|103401656|103401657|103401689|103401691|103401729|103402004|103402031|103402035|103402084|103402111|103402115|103402135|103402137,2890,NULL,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477358,0,NULL,P42261,NULL,129148,,NULL

Synthesis and quantitative structure-activity relationships._||_Abstract: A number of 3-isoxazolol bioisosteres, 7a-i, of (S)-glutamic acid (Glu), in which the methyl group of (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA, 1) was replaced by different 5-membered heterocyclic rings, were synthesized. Comparative in vitro pharmacological studies on this series of AMPA analogues were performed using receptor binding assays (IC50 values) and the electrophysiological rat cortical slice model (EC50 values). None of these compounds showed detectable affinity for the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid subtype of Glu receptors. Some of the compounds were weak inhibitors of [3H]kainic acid binding. The inhibitory effects on [3H]AMPA binding and agonist potencies at AMPA receptors of 7a-i were strictly dependent on the structure, electrostatic potential, and methyl substitution of the heterocyclic 5-substituent. Thus, while 7a (IC50 = 0.094 microM; EC50 = 2.3 microM) was approximately equipotent with AMPA (IC50 = 0.023 microM; EC50 = 5.4 microM), (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1H-imidazol-2-yl)isoxazol-4-yl]propio nic acid (7b) (IC50 = 48 microM; EC50 = 550 microM) was some 2 orders of magnitude weaker than AMPA, and (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-isoxazol-4 -yl] propionic acid (7c) (IC50 > 100 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive. Furthermore, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(2-methyl-2H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7i) (IC50 = 0.030 microM; EC50 = 0.92 microM) was more potent than AMPA, whereas its N-1 methyl isomer, (RS)-2-amino-3-[3-hydroxy-5-(1-methyl-1H-tetrazol-5-yl)isoxazol -4-yl] propionic acid (7h) (IC50 = 54 microM; EC50 > 1000 microM) was inactive as an AMPA agonist. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis revealed a positive correlation between receptor affinity, electrostatic potential near the nitrogen atom at the 'ortho' position of the heterocyclic 5-substituent, and the rotational energy barrier around the bond connecting the two rings. We envisage that a hydrogen bond between the protonated amino group and an ortho-positioned heteroatom of the ring substituent at the 5-position stabilize receptor-active conformations of these AMPA analogues.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL702521,20181015,1221|3481675|10562939|10610792|10658567|10729534|10752476|10800053|10823814|10824747,103174429|103289365|103309919|103309920|103310042|103310043|103310045|103310166|103310208|103310209,2890|2891|2892|2893,In vitro,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,9288165,0,NULL,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,NULL,NULL,,NULL

Neither 7 nor 14 showed detectable affinities for the receptor, ion channel, or modulatory sites of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex. Quantitative receptor autoradiographic and conventional binding techniques were used to study the affinities of 7 and 14 for non-NMDA receptor sites. Both compounds were inhibitors of the binding of [3H]AMPA (IC50 = 90 and 29 microM, respectively). Compounds 14 and 7 were both very weak inhibitors of the high-affinity binding of radioactive kainic acid [( 3H]KAIN).

Synthesis, modeling, and molecular pharmacology._||_Abstract: We have previously described (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-6H-cyclohepta[d]isoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (4-AHCP) as a highly effective agonist at non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (non-NMDA) glutamate (Glu) receptors in vivo, which is more potent than (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid (AMPA) but inactive at NMDA receptors. However, 4-AHCP was found to be much weaker than AMPA as an inhibitor of [(3)H]AMPA binding and to have limited effect in a [(3)H]kainic acid binding assay using rat cortical membranes. To shed light on the mechanism(s) underlying this quite enigmatic pharmacological profile of 4-AHCP, we have now developed a synthesis of (S)-4-AHCP (6) and (R)-4-AHCP (7). At cloned metabotropic Glu receptors mGluR1alpha (group I), mGluR2 (group II), and mGluR4a (group III), neither 6 nor 7 showed significant agonist or antagonist effects. The stereoisomer 6, but not 7, activated cloned AMPA receptor subunits GluR1o, GluR3o, and GluR4o with EC(50) values in the range 4.5-15 microM and the coexpressed kainate-preferring subunits GluR6 + KA2 (EC(50) = 6.4 microM). Compound 6, but not 7, proved to be a very potent agonist (EC(50) = 0.13 microM) at the kainate-preferring GluR5 subunit, equipotent with (S)-2-amino-3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisothiazol-4-yl)propionic acid [(S)-Thio-ATPA, 4] and almost 4 times more potent than (S)-2-amino-3-(5-tert-butyl-3-hydroxyisoxazol-4-yl)propionic acid [(S)-ATPA, 3]. Compound 6 thus represents a new structural class of GluR5 agonists. Molecular modeling and docking to a crystal structure of the extracellular binding domain of the AMPA subunit GluR2 has enabled identification of the probable active conformation and binding mode of 6.

163312,Literature-derived,Inhibition of [3H]-AMPA binding to Quisqualate receptor of central nervous system,"Title: Phosphinic acid analogues of GABA. 2. Selective, orally active GABAB antagonists._||_Abstract: In 1987, 25 years after the synthesis of the potent and selective GABAB agonist baclofen (1), Kerr et al. described the first GABAB antagonist phaclofen 2. However, phaclofen and structurally similar derivatives 3-5 did not cross the blood-brain barrier and hence were inactive in vivo as central nervous system agents. As a consequence, the therapeutic potential of GABAB antagonists remained unclear. In exploring GABA and baclofen derivatives by replacing the carboxylic acid residue with various phosphinic acid groups, we discovered more potent and water soluble GABAB antagonists. Electrophysiological experiments in vivo demonstrated that some of the new compounds were capable of penetrating the blood-brain barrier after oral administration. Neurotransmitter release experiments showed that they interacted with several presynaptic GABAB receptor subtypes, enhancing the release of GABA, glutamate, aspartate, and somatostatin. The new GABAB antagonists interacted also with postsynaptic GABAB receptors, as they blocked late inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. They facilitated the induction of long-term potentiation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting potential cognition enhancing effects. Fifteen compounds were investigated in various memory and learning paradigms in rodents. Although several compounds were found to be active, only 10 reversed the age-related deficits of old rats in a multiple-trial one-way active avoidance test after chronic treatment. The cognition facilitating effects of 10 were confirmed in learning experiments in Rhesus monkeys. The novel GABAB antagonists showed also protective effects in various animal models of absence epilepsy.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL764780,20181014,130021,103335975,2890|2891|2892|2893,NULL,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,7650685,0,NULL,P42261|P42262|P42263|P48058,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The initially reported tryptamine analogues displayed either poor solution stability, potent central nervous system activity, or both of these undesirable characteristics and were unacceptable for clinical evaluation. A series of 1-(2-aminopropyl)-1H-indazole analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their suitability for consideration as clinical candidates. 1-((S)-2-Aminopropyl)-1H-indazol-6-ol (9) was identified as a peripherally acting potent 5-HT(2) receptor agonist (EC(50) = 42.7 nM, E(max) = 89%) with high selectivity for the 5-HT(2) receptors relative to other serotonergic receptor subtypes and other families of receptors and has significantly greater solution stability than alpha-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine. Additionally, 9 potently lowers intraocular pressure in conscious ocular hypertensive monkeys (-13 mmHg, 33%); this reduction appears to be through a local rather than a centrally mediated effect.

Several members of this class inhibit NMDA receptor responses in the nanomolar range and are more than 50-fold selective over GluN1/GluN2A and GluN1/GluN2B NMDA receptors, as well as AMPA, kainate, GABA, glycine, nicotinic, serotonin, and purinergic receptors. Analysis of the purified enantiomers of one of the more potent and selective compounds shows that the S-enantiomer is both more potent and more selective than the R-enantiomer. The S-enantiomer had an IC50 of 0.17-0.22 μM at GluN2D- and GluN2C-containing receptors, respectively, and showed over 70-fold selectivity over other NMDA receptor subunits.

Polyamine toxins are extensively used for the characterization of subtypes of ionotropic glutamate receptors, in particular Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA and kainate receptors. We have previously shown that an analogue of PhTX-433 with one of the amino groups replaced by a methylene group, philanthotoxin-83 (PhTX-83) is a selective and potent antagonist of AMPA receptors. We now describe the solid-phase synthesis of analogues of PhTX-83 and the electrophysiological characterization of these analogues on cloned AMPA and kainate receptors. The polyamine portion of PhTX-83 was modified systematically by changing the position of the secondary amino group along the polyamine chain. In another series of analogues, the acyl moiety of PhTX-83 was replaced by acids of different size and lipophilicity. Using electrophysiological techniques, PhTX-56 was shown to be a highly potent (K(i) = 3.3 +/- 0.78 nM) and voltage-dependent antagonist of homomeric GluR1 receptors and was more than 1000-fold less potent when tested on heteromeric GluR1+GluR2, as well as homomeric GluR5(Q) receptors, thus being selective for Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors. Variation of the acyl group of PhTX-83 had only minor effect on antagonist potency at homomeric GluR1 receptors but led to a significant decrease in the voltage-dependence. In conclusion, PhTX-56 is a novel, very potent, and selective antagonist of Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA receptors and is a promising tool for structure/function studies of the ion channel of the AMPA receptor.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL680869,20181017,10598970|14608128|44368884|44368885|44368886|44368895|44368910|44369047|44369048|44369061|44369062|44369077|44369235|44369248|44369251|44369283|44369293|44369295|44369306|44369308,103242301|103395119|103401345|103401346|103401347|103401358|103401386|103401656|103401657|103401689|103401691|103401729|103402004|103402031|103402035|103402084|103402111|103402115|103402135|103402137,2890,NULL,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,12477358,0,NULL,P42261,NULL,129148,,NULL

One of the compounds, 2-amino-3-[3-(carboxymethoxy)-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl]propionic acid (AMOA, 7), was synthesized via O-alkylation by ethyl chloroacetate of the amino acid protected AMPA derivative 4. The other compound, 2-amino-3-[2-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)-methyl-5-methyl-3-+ ++oxoisoxazolin -4-yl]propionic acid (AMNH, 14) was synthesized with use of 4-(chloromethyl)-3-methoxy-5-methylisoxazole (8) as the starting material. The intermediate 4-(chloromethyl)-2-(3-methoxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl)methyl-5-me thylisoxazolin- 3-one (11) was converted into the acetamidomalonate (12), which was stepwise deprotected to give 14.

Neither 7 nor 14 showed detectable affinities for the receptor, ion channel, or modulatory sites of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor complex. Quantitative receptor autoradiographic and conventional binding techniques were used to study the affinities of 7 and 14 for non-NMDA receptor sites. Both compounds were inhibitors of the binding of [3H]AMPA (IC50 = 90 and 29 microM, respectively).

The structure-activity relationships for the AUBAs showed distinct structural requirements for the substituents on the two aromatic ring systems. Only para-substituents were tolerated on the benzoic acid moiety (ring A), whereas ring B tolerated a variety of substituents, but with a preference for lipophilic substituents.

We report here the novel synthesis and pharmacological characterization of a range of willardiine (18-23) and 6-azawillardiine (24-28) analogs on cells individually expressing human homomeric hGluR1, hGluR2, hGluR4, or hGluR5 receptors. Reaction of the sodium salts of substituted uracils (7-12) or 6-azauracils (13-16) with (S)-3-[(tert-butoxycarbonyl)amino]oxetan-2-one (17) in dry DMF, subsequent deprotection in TFA, and purification by ion-exchange chromatography gave mainly the willardiine analog in which alkylation took place on N1 of the uracil ring. We have investigated the subtype selectivity of these compounds by examining their binding affinity for homomeric hGluR1, -2, -4, or -5 (and hGluR6 in the case of 5-iodowillardiine (22)). From this study we have demonstrated that 22 has high affinity for hGluR5 and, compared to kainate, displays excellent selectivity for this receptor over both the AMPA receptor subtypes and the homomeric kainate receptor, hGluR6. 5-Fluorowillardiine (19) has higher affinity than AMPA for both homomeric hGluR1 and hGluR2 and compared to AMPA displays greater selectivity for AMPA receptor subtypes over the kainate receptor, hGluR5. Some structural features required for optimal activity at homomeric AMPA or kainate receptor subtypes have also been identified. It would appear that quite large lipophilic substituents at the 5-position of the uracil ring not only are accommodated by hGluR5 receptors but also lead to enhanced affinity for these receptors. In contrast to this, for optimal binding affinity to hGluR1, -2, or -4, smaller, electron-withdrawing substituents are required. For optimal activity at hGluR4 receptors a 6-aza-substituted willardiine is favored.

In an attempt to produce antagonists of kainate and AMPA receptors analogues of willardiine with substituents at the N3 position of the uracil ring were synthesized. The N3-4-carboxybenzyl substituted analogue (38c) was found to be equipotent at AMPA and GLUK5-containing kainate receptors in the neonatal rat spinal cord. The N3-2-carboxybenzyl substituted analogue (38a) proved to be a potent and selective GLUK5 subunit containing kainate receptor antagonist when tested on native rat and human recombinant AMPA and kainate receptor subtypes. The GLUK5 kainate receptor antagonist activity was found to reside in the S enantiomer (44a) whereas the R enantiomer (44b) was almost inactive. 5-Iodo substitution of the uracil ring of 44a gave 45, which was found to have enhanced potency and selectivity for GLUK5.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL863279,20181019,11674376,103473689,2890,NULL,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,16302825,0,NULL,P42261,9606,45,,NULL

The molecular basis for the functional selectivity profile of 2-Bn-Tet-AMPA._||_Abstract: Four 2-substituted Tet-AMPA [Tet = tetrazolyl, AMPA = 2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolyl)propionic acid] analogues were characterized functionally at the homomeric AMPA receptors GluR1i, GluR2Qi, GluR3i, and GluR4i in a Fluo-4/Ca2+ assay. Whereas 2-Et-Tet-AMPA, 2-Pr-Tet-AMPA, and 2-iPr-Tet-AMPA were nonselective GluR agonists, 2-Bn-Tet-AMPA exhibited a 40-fold higher potency at GluR4i than at GluR1i.

However, the stereoisomers of 2-amino-3-(4-hydroxy-1,2,5-thiadiazol-3-yl)propionic acid (TDPA) have similar enantiopharmacology. To understand this observation, we have determined the X-ray structures of ( R)-TDPA and ( S)-TDPA in complex with the ligand-binding core of iGluR2 and investigated the binding pharmacology at AMPA and kainate receptors. Both enantiomers induce full domain closure in iGluR2 but adopt different conformations when binding to the receptor, which may explain the similar enantiopharmacology.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL934442,20181023,10352480|10420002,103578281|103578282,2890,NULL,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,18269227,0,NULL,P42261,NULL,521,,NULL

Allosteric modulators of AMPA receptors promote dimerization by binding to a dimer interface and reducing desensitization and deactivation. The pyrrolidine allosteric modulators, piracetam and aniracetam, were among the first of this class of drugs to be discovered. We have determined the structure of the ligand binding domain of the AMPA receptor subtypes GluA2 and GluA3 with piracetam and a corresponding structure of GluA3 with aniracetam. Both drugs bind to GluA2 and GluA3 in a very similar manner, suggesting little subunit specificity. However, the binding sites for piracetam and aniracetam differ considerably. Aniracetam binds to a symmetrical site at the center of the dimer interface. Piracetam binds to multiple sites along the dimer interface with low occupation, one of which is a unique binding site for potential allosteric modulators. This new site may be of importance in the design of new allosteric regulators.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL1072470,20180912,4843,103213021,2890,NULL,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,20163115,0,NULL,P42261,NULL,NULL,,NULL

The sequencing of the human genome has identified more than 400 putative ion channels, but only a fraction of these have been cloned and functionally tested. The widespread tissue distribution of ion channels, coupled with the plethora of physiological consequences of their opening and closing, makes ion-channel-targeted drug discovery highly compelling. However, despite some important drugs in clinical use today, as a class, ion channels remain underexploited in drug discovery and many existing drugs are poorly selective with significant toxicities or suboptimal efficacy. This Perspective seeks to review the ion channel family, its structural and functional features, and the diseases that are known to be modulated by members of the family. In particular, we will explore the structure and properties of known ligands and consider the future prospects for drug discovery in this challenging but high potential area.",43,ChEMBL,CHEMBL2327947,20180925,5289518|6324635,103199750|103237447,2890,NULL,P42261,Curation Efforts|Research and Development,23121096,0,NULL,P42261,9606,NULL,,NULL

NMDA receptors have been implicated in a wide range of neurological diseases and thus represent an important therapeutic target. We herein describe a novel series of pyrrolidinones that selectively potentiate only NMDA receptors that contain the GluN2C subunit. The most active analogues tested were over 100-fold selective for recombinant GluN2C-containing receptors over GluN2A/B/D-containing NMDA receptors as well as AMPA and kainate receptors.
